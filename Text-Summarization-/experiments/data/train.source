[Person1]:  Could you do me a favor? [Person2]:  Sure. What is it? [Person1]:  Could you run over to the store? We need a few things. [Person2]:  All right. What do you want me to get? [Person1]:  Well, could you pick up some sugar? [Person2]:  Okay. How much? [Person1]:  A small bag. I guess we also need a few oranges. [Person2]:  How many? [Person1]:  Oh, let's see. . . About six. [Person2]:  Anything else? [Person1]:  Yes. We're out of milk. [Person2]:  Okay. How much do you want me to get? A gallon? [Person1]:  No. I think a half gallon will be enough. [Person2]:  Is that all? [Person1]:  I think so. Have you got all that? [Person2]:  Yes. That's small bag of sugar, four oranges, and a half gallon of milk. [Person1]:  Do you have enough money? [Person2]:  I think so. [Person1]:  Thanks very much. I appreciate it.
[Person1]:  Are things still going badly with your house guest?  [Person2]:  It's getting worse. Now he's eating me out of house and home. I've tried talking to him but it all goes in one ear and out the other. He makes himself at home, which is fine. But what really gets me is that yesterday he walked into the living room in the raw and I had company over! That was the last straw.  [Person1]:  leo, I really think you're beating around the bush with this guy. I know he used to be your best friend in college, but I really think it's time to lay down the law.  [Person2]:  You're right. Everything is probably going to come to a head tonight. I'll keep you informed. 
[Person1]:  Have you ever thought about having children, Kaitlyn? [Person2]:  My husband and I have thought about it, but we've decided not to have any. They're just too expensive. Besides, with all the news about global warming on the news lately, who knows what kind of Worl [Person1]:  Well, I've always wanted to have lots of children. Growing up with only one brother, I always felt a bit lonely. What do you think about families with only one child? [Person2]:  For me, growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention. I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn't ever have to share. [Person1]:  Don't you think you would miss having other people around? [Person2]:  No way! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7. You know, I don't think I've ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ' home. What do you think fo the one-child policy [Person1]:  If China didn't have such a policy, can you imagine how many people there would be in China now? [Person2]:  That's true. But as a woman, I'm glad that even though I don't want any children, I at least have a choice in how many children I have. On the other hand, I can't imagine what China would be like [Person1]:  Do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child? [Person2]:  I don't know what other people think, but I, for one, envy only children!
[Person1]:  Is everything to your satisfaction? [Person2]:  No, the steak was recommended, but it is not very fresh. [Person1]:  Oh! Sorry to hear that. This is quite unusual as we have steak from the market every day. [Person2]:  So what? It is not fresh and I'm not happy about it. [Person1]:  I'm sorry, sir. Do you wish to try something else? That would be on the house, of course. [Person2]:  No, thank you.
[Person1]:  What's the weather like in your city?  [Person2]:  In the summer it gets very hot. The temperture is between often 37 and 40 centigrade. When it is hot we often get rains. The winters are drier.  [Person1]:  The summer tempreture ususally often reaches about 20 or25 in my city. The rain falls mostly in the winter. And we often get snow.  [Person2]:  What are the temperatures in winter? In my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees.  [Person1]:  In winter temperture often falls to zero at night temperture can be below that. The streets are often icing in the morning. With high such tempertures you must get some thunderstorns.  [Person2]:  Yeah, we do. In the middle of summer there can be found storms every day ususally in the afternoon. I heard your city has a lot of fog, is that true?  [Person1]:  We do have a few fog days in winter. But I would not say we have a lot of fogs. The sky are usually clearly in your city, are they?  [Person2]:  Yes, they are like I said we have thunderstorms. But each one usually last a few hours. Then the skys are clear again.  [Person1]:  Have you ever had snow in your city?  [Person2]:  My grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child. But my parents and I never see it outside of my city.  [Person1]:  The river in my city sometime freeze over. People go ice-skating on it. In summer people go boating on the river. But few people go swimming because it is not very clean.  [Person2]:  As you know, my city is on the coast. the water is also not clean. But people still go swimming all year around. I perfer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning. 
[Person1]:  I would like to order some internet today. [Person2]:  What kind would you like? [Person1]:  What kind of internet is there? [Person2]:  You can get DEL or dial-up. [Person1]:  Which of those two is best? [Person2]:  I would recommend DEL. [Person1]:  So that one better? [Person2]:  It's better because it doesn't tie up the phone. [Person1]:  What do you mean by that? [Person2]:  DEL isn't connected through your phone line, but dial-up is. [Person1]:  So then I can't use my phone if I'm on the internet? [Person2]:  That's correct. With DEL you can do both.
[Person1]:  what are you looking for? [Person2]:  I want to buy a new camcorder for my trip this summer. [Person1]:  do you know what camcorder options are available? [Person2]:  not really. I thought I'd just have a look today. [Person1]:  would you like to look at the new digital camcorders that have just come in? [Person2]:  sure. I'd like to see the smallest camcorder that you have first. [Person1]:  ok. This Sony model is their newest and our most popular camcorder. Why don't you see if you like the way it feel? [Person2]:  it's very light. That would be good. How is the battery life? [Person1]:  it's got an above-average battery life. It lasts up tp 12 hours and can be charged in 30 minutes. [Person2]:  can you also take still photos with this? [Person1]:  yes, that is an option. [Person2]:  how about night vision? Can you use it in the dark? [Person1]:  yes. I can show you examples of some footages that was taken with this camera in the dark. [Person2]:  that's not bad at all. How's the microphone? Does it pick up much sound? [Person1]:  It can record any sound that's within about 8 feet of the camera. [Person2]:  how does that compare with other models? [Person1]:  there are models that can pick up more sound than this one, but they're much bigger and heavier than this one. [Person2]:  I guess you can't have everything, can you?
[Person1]:  What can I do for you, madam? [Person2]:  I'd like to buy a toy car for my son. [Person1]:  How about this one? [Person2]:  It looks nice. How much is it? [Person1]:  They're three hundred dollars. [Person2]:  Oh, I'm afraid it's too expensive. Can you show me something cheaper? [Person1]:  OK, This one is one hundred and twenty. It's the cheapest here. [Person2]:  OK, I'll take it. Here's the money. [Person1]:  Thank you very much.

I have already called several times. It seems I always catch him out of the office. [Person1]:  Oh, I'm sorry. Mr. Nelson is away at the moment. I'm sorry that you keep missing him while he is out of the office. Would you like to leave a message? [Person2]:  I'm sorry, I didn't hear you clearly. Could you repeat that please? [Person1]:  Certainly. Mr. Nelson can not take your call at the moment because he is away. He stepped out of the office for the whole afternoon and is not expected back until tomorrow morning. His schedule is very unpredictable at times, so the best way to reach him is to first make an appointment by email or text messaging. [Person2]:  Can I leave a message for him please? [Person1]:  Of course, can you leave your name and number? I'm sure Mr. Nelson will return your call as soon as he is able. [Person2]:  My name is Max Richards, my phone number is 898-3423.

[Person1]:  Amanda, how do you like this peaked cap? [Person2]:  Didn't you say you want to buy a top hat? [Person1]:  But I think this one fits me Well. Why don't you try on the sombrero in black? [Person2]:  I don't like caps at all.
[Person1]:  It smells like an ashtray in here! [Person2]:  Hi honey! What's wrong? Why do you have that look on your face? [Person1]:  What's wrong? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking. [Person2]:  No! I said I was going to cut down which is very different. You can't just expect me to go cold turkey overnight! [Person1]:  Look, there are other ways to quit. You can try the nicotine patch, or nicotine chewing gum. We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place. It's not like you can just light up like before. [Person2]:  I know, I know. I am trying but, I don't have the willpower to just quit. I can't fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch! Please understand? [Person1]:  Fine! I want a divorce!
[Person1]:  I can bet the farm that you will regret about your decision. You cannot find a better one.  [Person2]:  How can you be so sure? You haven't been together with her, have you?  [Person1]:  No. But I'm sure she is a good girl. My sixth sense tells me so.  [Person2]:  Then try it yourself.

[Person1]:  Hi, David, you look awful. What's the trouble? [Person2]:  Well, believe it or not, I had an accident in the car this morning. Someone drove into the back of my car. [Person1]:  No! How did it happen? [Person2]:  I was just turning into my drive when another car came round the corner and drove into the back of mine. [Person1]:  Didn't you see him? [Person2]:  No, I didn't. I looked in my driving mirror and there was no one coming. Not only that, I also looked in the big mirror on the other side of the road. [Person1]:  So he must have been coming very fast if you didn't see him. [Person2]:  That's right. And he went straight into me.
[Person1]:  Good evening, everyone. Tonight, we will meet an honored guest, Mr. Philip Brown. [Person2]:  Hello, everyone. I'm the founder of the website Student Experience. I'm glad to meet all of you today. [Person1]:  Well, Mr. Brown, what made you decide to set up a website mainly for students? [Person2]:  To be exact, our website attracts not only students, but also teachers and families. [Person1]:  Right. When did you start the website? [Person2]:  In 2010. [Person1]:  How did Student Experience begin? [Person2]:  When Student Experience was founded, I was sharing an apartment with my sister Daisy. [Person1]:  You two decided to set up the website together? [Person2]:  Not really. She had been in a car accident around that time, and she needed some assistance with her daily activities. It took her two years before she could live independently again. [Person1]:  That is why you had the thought to start the website? [Person2]:  Exactly. Many other people with disabilities have the same need for assistance. So people with this need can come to the website. And this gives good opportunities for students who want part-time jobs and pocket money at the same time.
[Person1]:  You look quite different from what you used to. [Person2]:  Sure. I started exercising regularly two years ago and went from 253 pounds to a healthy 160 pounds and that is the only thing I did not give up halfway.
[Person1]:  Wow, is that your sports car?  [Person2]:  Yes, do you like it?  [Person1]:  I love it! I used to always want to drive a green jaguar. Is it in good condition?  [Person2]:  Yt looks good on the outside, but the inside is a different story. It needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again.  [Person1]:  What's wrong with it?  [Person2]:  Well, first of all, it needs a new engine, which is extremely expensive.  [Person1]:  When's the last time you had it serviced?  [Person2]:  It must have been a few years ago now.  [Person1]:  I thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis.  [Person2]:  They do. Once my son was born, there was no reason to drive this car anymore. It's only a two-seater, you know!  [Person1]:  What else is wrong with it?  [Person2]:  The heating controls don't work anymore, so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car, even in the summer!  [Person1]:  Anything else?  [Person2]:  The brakes don't really work that well anymore either.  [Person1]:  Why don't you get it all fixed?  [Person2]:  It costs more than you think to run a car---especially when there are so many things wrong with it!  [Person1]:  Well, let me know when you can get it fixed. I'd love to go for a ride in it! 
[Person1]:  Would you care to order now, sir?  [Person2]:  Yes. I think we're ready. Janet?  [Person3]:  Yes. I'll have the baked salmon.  [Person1]:  Very good. And what kind of potatoes would you like with that?  [Person3]:  Boiled, please.  [Person1]:  Vegetable?  [Person3]:  Broccoli. . . Oh, no. Sorry. I think I'd rather have asparagus.  [Person1]:  The asparagus. Yes, ma'am. Soup or salad?  [Person3]:  Salad.  [Person1]:  And what kind of dressing would you like on that  [Person3]:  I'll take the Russian cheese.  [Person1]:  And what would you like to drink?  [Person3]:  Coffee, but I'll have that later.  [Person1]:  Very good, ma'am. And you , sir?  [Person2]:  I'd like the veal cutlet.  [Person1]:  I'm sorry, sir, but we're all out of the veal cutlet.  [Person2]:  Oh, I see. Well, bring me the steak then.  [Person1]:  Yes, sir. And how would you like that? 
[Person1]:  Would you like any toast, dear?  [Person2]:  Um?  [Person1]:  Toast, dear?  [Person2]:  As you like.  [Person1]:  Would you like any tea, dear?  [Person2]:  It doesn't make any difference to me.  [Person1]:  Oh, you're not listening to me.  [Person2]:  Leave me alone. 
[Person1]:  Hey Matt, What are you doing here? [Person2]:  I called your house and your brother told me you'd be here, nice jacket. [Person1]:  Thanks, it's a present from the baseball team. [Person2]:  They're going to miss you. You're their star player. [Person1]:  I wasn't. Today we lost, 22 to 2. [Person2]:  Ouch. I think we need to have a talk. [Person1]:  Look. If it's about my decision to go to New York. I'm not going to change my mind. [Person2]:  I realize that. [Person1]:  But I'll be back to visit and you can come and see me. [Person2]:  Now let's not kid ourselves. Four years in New York will pretty much end our relationship. [Person1]:  Lots of people have long distance relationships. [Person2]:  Not me. I'm not a long distance kind of guy, all our friends are getting married, they're having kids, I thought we were the next.
[Person1]:  Do you have something to read? [Person2]:  Yes, I do. [Person1]:  Could you lend me one? [Person2]:  OK. Here you are. [Person1]:  Thanks. It's rather cold this morning, wouldn't you say? [Person2]:  You're right. [Person1]:  Do you know the news? [Person2]:  Which one? [Person1]:  Brazil wins the World Cup. [Person2]:  Yes, I see.
[Person1]:  I am so excited! [Person2]:  Excited about what? [Person1]:  I just voted. [Person2]:  Is this the first time you'Ve voted? [Person1]:  Yes, I just had my 18th birthday this year. [Person2]:  That's lucky. [Person1]:  Why is that? [Person2]:  You turned 18 in an election year. [Person1]:  I didn't think about it like that. [Person2]:  Really? [Person1]:  No, but that makes me even more excited. [Person2]:  You're a part of history.
[Person1]:  Linda, would you care for some candies or cookies? [Person2]:  No, don't try to tempt me. I'm becoming chubby, and I have to slender down. [Person1]:  You are not really chubby. You are actually thin enough. [Person2]:  I don't think so. I know I've put on weight this winter. [Person1]:  So you are watching your weight, aren't you? [Person2]:  Yes, to tell you the truth. I am on the diet.
[Person1]:  It is really exciting news. [Person2]:  What news? [Person1]:  You don't know? The company is going to replace these old computers with the latest ones. [Person2]:  You know what we will get? [Person1]:  We will all get a docking station on our own desk from which you can remove your laptop easily. And if you come back to office, you just reconnect your laptop with docking station. [Person2]:  What docking station? [Person1]:  This is a kind of socket mounted to your desk. The socket has all the wire connections of the company line and all the other office automation equipments, like fax, copier, a screen, printer and scanner, and it will be very convenient. [Person2]:  Another big step forward in saving on our office equipment, I don't need a desktop anymore. A laptop is enough.
[Person1]:  I'm having problems with my computer. [Person2]:  What's wrong with it? [Person1]:  For some reason it won't turn on. [Person2]:  Have you checked the connections on your computer? [Person1]:  What connections? [Person2]:  There are cords that connect your computer to a power outlet. [Person1]:  Will the cords keep it from turning on? [Person2]:  It won't turn on if the cords aren't connected. [Person1]:  I didn't think of that. [Person2]:  Try it and see if it works. [Person1]:  I think that I will, thanks. [Person2]:  It should work, but let me know if it doesn't.
[Person1]:  Well, we've settled everything in connection with this transaction except the question of the mode of payment. [Person2]:  Because this order is a comparatively big one, we would like to pay by time L / C, say, 60 days L / C. [Person1]:  Payment by sight L / C is quite usual in international trade, and as a rule, we only accept payment by sight L / C. [Person2]:  But we have only moderate mean at hand. If you can do us a special favor this time and allow us to delay payment, we'd really appreciate it. [Person1]:  Accepting time L / C is unusual and I've never done it before, but we could consider your request. I'll phone our company to see what they say. [Person2]:  Thank you for your consideration. When will you let me know your answer? [Person1]:  This afternoon.
[Person1]:  If you are staying here for a few days, we'd be delighted to see you at our factory. [Person2]:  It's very kind of you to say so. My associate and I will be interested in visiting your factory. [Person1]:  Let us know when you are free. We'll arrange the tour for you. [Person2]:  Thank you. I'll give you a call this afternoon to set the time. There's nothing like seeing things with one's own eyes. [Person1]:  That's for sure. You'll know our products better after the visit.
[Person1]:  Look, the aliens are sending a message to Mulder. This rocks! [Person2]:  Whoops. That's my pager. I had to get it for work. [Person1]:  You have a pager? ! That's a little high-tech for you, Stu. Are you sure you know how to use it? [Person2]:  Well, I know how to turn it off! [Person1]:  No, you don't! It's still beeping! Come on, hand it over and I'll turn it off for you.

[Person1]:  Hello, Frank. [Person2]:  Hi, Steven. What's new with you? [Person1]:  Not too much. I'm looking to rent an apartment. [Person2]:  Why? [Person1]:  I dislike my roommate. He really turns me off. [Person2]:  What happened? Did you have a fight? [Person1]:  No. He likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room. [Person2]:  I hate that, either. Did you tell him your feelings? [Person1]:  Yes. But he doesn't care. I really wouldn't want to move, but I simply can't stand him. [Person2]:  It's a problem. You'd better move.
[Person1]:  Hi, Jack, have you thought about your ideal job in the future? Do you want to be an excellent math teacher like your father? [Person2]:  For Gosh's sake! I hate being a teacher. I still have a clear memory of the terrible days when my father helped me with all my subjects. But it is strange that I made great progress in my English learning. How about you, Jessica? [Person1]:  Well, I dream of being a brilliant dancer like my mother. You know, she is 43 now, and she has been dancing since she was 20 years old. [Person2]:  I can't believe it! She looks quite young and has a great figure. [Person1]:  Yes. She has formed a good habit of having enough fruits and vegetables every day. And more importantly, she keeps an optimistic attitude towards life which benefits her physical condition. [Person2]:  Oh, I see. How I wish I had taken enough exercise. [Person1]:  Come on. Don't lose heart! If you think you can, you can. Let's get rid of our bad habits and learn from our great parents. [Person2]:  Why not do it right now? Shall we swim this afternoon? [Person1]:  With pleasure!
[Person1]:  Well, known, Jim , I'm. . . I'm pretty much in favour of computers, I think computers teach kids to think , because they require logical thought.  [Person2]:  But I. . . I don't agree with that , because computers weaken kids' ability to think, because kids don't learn basic skills.  [Person1]:  What do you mean?  [Person2]:  They can't spell , they can't add, they can't subtract, they even don't remember any more. that's because they rely on gadgets.  [Person1]:  That's not the gadgets. Creating programmes is stimulate thoughts. 
[Person1]:  Hello, it is Carol, isn't it? [Person2]:  Oh! Mike? Oh my goodness, I haven't seen you for ages. [Person1]:  Nice to see you again after all these years. What have you been doing? [Person2]:  Well, I tried many things after we left school. I'm now working for a large oil company, in charge of sales mainly, so I travel a lot. [Person1]:  Oh, that's great, you must really enjoy that. [Person2]:  Oh, I do. It's exciting, it is quite tiring, though. What about you Mike? What do you do? [Person1]:  I work in a law firm.

[Person2]:  Well, we are really looking for someone who isn't too concerned about working fairly long hours. [Person1]:  What do you mean by long hours? [Person2]:  This is a job which does, as the advertisement says, have travel possibility and very often, one would be away at weekends, for instance. [Person1]:  Oh.

If you want to stretch your legs, a good exercise is to lift your knee in front of your body, like this. It's a very simple exercise, but very effective. [Person1]:  I need to excise my arms too. How can I do that? [Person2]:  One good way is to do push-ups. Another way is to use weights. Make sure you grip the weights firmly. You don't want to drop them on your feet!

[Person1]:  Jacob, are you interested in helping me out and going on a blind date with a friend of mine? [Person2]:  That depends. What does she look like? [Person1]:  Well, she's got a beautiful face and long curly red hair. [Person2]:  How tall is she? [Person1]:  She's fairly tall, maybe 2 inches taller than me. [Person2]:  Is she chubby? [Person1]:  Not at all. She's actually very athletic. [Person2]:  It sounds like she's pretty good-looking. Does she wear glasses? [Person1]:  No, but she does wear contact lenses. [Person2]:  How's her skin? [Person1]:  She's got a gorgeous complexion with a few freckles on her nose. [Person2]:  Does she have any piercings or tattoos? [Person1]:  I think she has her ears pierced and she definitely has a few tattoos, one on her lower back, one on her neck, and one on her left foot. [Person2]:  What's the tattoo on her foot like? [Person1]:  It's a butterfly---everyone in her family has one. [Person2]:  Even her mother? [Person1]:  Yes, even her mother. [Person2]:  What's her personality like? [Person1]:  She's a lot like me. [Person2]:  So there is something wrong with her! It was beginning to sound like she was too good to be true!
[Person1]:  do you want to go out for dinner tonight? [Person2]:  sure. Have you got anywhere in mind? [Person1]:  I'm starving, so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions. [Person2]:  that Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions. Do you want to go there? [Person1]:  I'm not really in the mood for Italian, actually. I was thinking of something a bit spicy. [Person2]:  if you want spicy food, then I'd recommend going to a Thai, Indian or Chinese restaurant. How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road? [Person1]:  I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there. But, they've westernized their food, so it's not actually that spicy. [Person2]:  you're right. Most of their dishes have sweet sauces. We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us. [Person1]:  the Taj? They're a bit expensive, but they do serve large portions of very hot food. [Person2]:  the Taj it is then. [Person1]:  shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money? [Person2]:  they'll still charge us a corkage fee. [Person1]:  that's right. It'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway. [Person2]:  don't worry about money. I'll treat you tonight. [Person1]:  are you sure? We could go Dutch. [Person2]:  no, I'll pay. It's my turn anyway. You paid last time. [Person1]:  I won't argue with that! Let's go!
[Person1]:  Hey, Paul, why the long face? [Person2]:  It's difficult to explain. [Person1]:  Try me. [Person2]:  Well, I had a terrible day of work, I'm thinking of quiting my job. [Person1]:  Take it easy, maybe tomorrow will be different. [Person2]:  I don't know, I can't stand my job these days. [Person1]:  Cheer up, I hope you'll feel better soon.
[Person1]:  You seem to like her very much, don't you? [Person2]:  I can't deny that. She is so beautiful that I fell in love with her at the first sight. I wish I knew more about her. [Person1]:  But I heard that she had a three-year-old girl. [Person2]:  I can not belive that. It must be cooked up by someone.
[Person1]:  Paul, what kind of music do you like to listen to? [Person2]:  All kinds, but mostly Pop, rock and classical. Why? [Person1]:  I have tickets to a show. Do you want to go with me? [Person2]:  What kind of music is it? [Person1]:  Pop. It's Maria Carey. [Person2]:  When is it? [Person1]:  At 8P M tomorrow night. [Person2]:  Yeah, I'd like to go. Do you think we should have dinner first? [Person1]:  Yes, that's a good idea. [Person2]:  Let's eat at the restaurant across the street from my apartment. [Person1]:  Oh, I think I know the place you mean. We ate there last month, right? [Person2]:  Yes, that's right. You have a good memory.
[Person1]:  Steve. Is that you? [Person2]:  Yeah. What's going on? [Person1]:  Not much. What a surprise to see you here. [Person2]:  Yeah. It's been a couple of months since I saw you. [Person1]:  What have you been up to? [Person2]:  I just started working out. [Person1]:  Really? Where do you work out at? [Person2]:  I joined the Samsung Health Club last month. [Person1]:  What do you mostly do during your workout? [Person2]:  I concentrate mostly on my legs, chest, arms and stomach. [Person1]:  I should start exercising more. [Person2]:  It's hard work while exercising, but it is a great feeling when I get done. [Person1]:  I have a running machine at home. I used to use it, but I already got sick of it. [Person2]:  Exercising at home is hard. The environment is not suited for exercising. [Person1]:  If I want to exercise, I will need to join a gym. [Person2]:  I have a couple of guest passes. You want to check out my health club? [Person1]:  That's a good idea. Let's go over the weekend. [Person2]:  Great. I'll call you Saturday morning. [Person1]:  Aright. I'll talk to you later. [Person2]:  Ok. Bye.
[Person1]:  All right, let's see who's ruining my TV time. [Person2]:  What are you going to do? Call my boss and chew him out? [Person1]:  Is your boss named Vic? Your pager says, This is Vic. Here I come! [Person2]:  Impossible. My pager is really old. It doesn't display messages. [Person1]:  Here, see for yourself. That's really strange! It's almost the same as when I. . . [Person2]:  Gosh, you're right! It's from some guy named Vic. I wonder who he is. . .
[Person1]:  I'm pleased to meet you again, Mrs. King. [Person2]:  Pleased to see you, too, Mr. Brown. [Person1]:  You've had a good trip, I hope. [Person2]:  Yes, a very pleasant journey, thank you. [Person1]:  It's been a full two years since we last saw each other. [Person2]:  So it is, I've come again to renew our sole agency agreement for another 2 years. [Person1]:  We shall be pleased to talk the matter over with you. You've done very well in fulfilling the agreement. [Person2]:  I'm glad you're satisfied with our work. I can assure you we've spared no effort and spent quite a sum of money in pushing the sales of your products. [Person1]:  Yes, we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sales of our pianos. We can see you are experienced in this particular line. [Person2]:  Thank you. [Person1]:  But I think the annual sale of 300 pianos for a sole distributorship in Canada is rather conservative. After all, you sold around 400 pieces there last year. You can sell more this year according to the marketing conditions at your end. [Person2]:  That is the result of our hard work. Well, what annual quantity would you suggest for the new agreement then? [Person1]:  500 pieces. [Person2]:  No, no. That's too big a number to be acceptable. Let's put it at 450 pieces. And we'll strive to sell more, of course. We wish to add another clause. For every 50 pieces sold in excess of the quota, we'll get 1 % more in commission for our efforts. [Person1]:  All right, let's fix it at 450 pieces then. And for every additional 50 pianos sold, we'll give you 1 % higher commission. [Person2]:  I suppose all the other terms remain unchanged. [Person1]:  We would like to make a specific mention of one more point. As our sole distributor, you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own. [Person2]:  No, certainly not. That's a reasonable restriction. [Person1]:  Another thing is that every six months we would like to receive from you a detailed report on current market conditions and the users comments on our products. [Person2]:  Yes, we've already prepared one. I've brought it with me. I'll put it forward when we talk with the manufacturers tomorrow. [Person1]:  Good, that's all then. [Person2]:  Good.
[Person1]:  Hi, what can I do for you? [Person2]:  I'd like to send this package to France. Can it be delivered in the next 5 days? [Person1]:  Yes, we offer an overnight service. It'll cost $70. [Person2]:  Ah, that's a bit expensive. Do you have a 3 days service? [Person1]:  No, but we can get your package to France in one week for $40. [Person2]:  Well, that sounds good. I'll take that. Is the service guaranteed? [Person1]:  Yes, we also offer a service where we can track your package, but that will cost $10 extra. [Person2]:  Oh, I won't need the tracking service.
[Person1]:  Where did you go yesterday? [Person2]:  I went to play tennis in the public park. [Person1]:  How often do you play tennis? [Person2]:  Twice a week. How about you? [Person1]:  I seldom play tennis. I prefer football and basketball. [Person2]:  But it is very difficult to gather a team of players together. [Person1]:  I usually play with my schoolmates. [Person2]:  Do you like watching football matches? [Person1]:  Yes, I went to the Than He Sports Center for the football match last Sunday.
[Person1]:  I'd like to order broadband internet for my laptop. [Person2]:  Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer, and a prompt will tell you the payment options. [Person1]:  Well, I don't have an Ethernet port. My computer runs entirely on wireless service. [Person2]:  That's too bad. But there are several alternatives, if you want to hear them. [Person1]:  Yes, please! Tell me about the alternatives. [Person2]:  We run a fully equipped computer lab on the first floor. [Person1]:  Very good. How much does that cost? [Person2]:  The service is free to hotel patrons. However, printing costs ten cents per page. [Person1]:  I see. And the other alternatives? [Person2]:  Alternatively, we do offer wireless in our lobby. You can bring your laptop down here. [Person1]:  Great! What if I need to print something in the lobby? [Person2]:  You would have to use the computer lab. I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
[Person1]:  How can I help you? [Person2]:  I'd like to buy some perfume for my girlfriend. [Person1]:  Do you know what kind of scent she usually wears? [Person2]:  She usually doesn't wear anything but a few drops of Chanel No. 5. But I'd like to buy her a new Fragrance. [Person1]:  OK, here are some of our most popular perfumes. [Person2]:  Which one would you recommend? [Person1]:  Personally, I quite like the new perfume from Clinique. It's a subtle flowery scent. What do you think? [Person2]:  That smells great. I'll take one bottle, please. [Person1]:  Would you like to buy any other cosmetics for your girlfriend? We have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers. [Person2]:  It's OK. She normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder, and I don't know what shade to buy. [Person1]:  How about some lipstick? Every woman needs a nice tube of lipstick. [Person2]:  She doesn't usually wear lipstick. She thinks it makes her nose look too big. [Person1]:  How about some mascara? That will make her eyes look bigger. [Person2]:  No, thank you. She has big enough eyes as it is. [Person1]:  I know what she would like-some whitening cream. [Person2]:  No thanks. Western women usually try to make their skin darker, not lighter. [Person1]:  Will that be all then? [Person2]:  That will be all. You've been very helpful, thanks.
[Person1]:  Oh, hey, Keri! You cook, right! You're a pretty good cook. [Person2]:  I'm OK. [Person1]:  OK. I want to make an omelet, so actually this is really silly, I've never made one before. How do you make an omelet? [Person2]:  OK, Well, I can teach you how I make them, which is the same way my father and grandmother make them, which is a little special. [Person1]:  OK. Yeah! Yeah! [Person2]:  First you take some eggs and crack them in a bowl, and whisk them up, quite, so they're quite high and fluffy, and in a hot pan, and you need a pan that's that's kind of small, that the sides go up at an angle. You put some oil and heat it up, so it's quite hot, and then you take your whipped up eggs, or whisked up eggs, and pour them into the pan, and as it's cooking, if you take a spatula, and push the bottom layer of the egg, to the side, to the sides, and then to the middle, so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan. [Person1]:  Oh, OK. Wow! [Person2]:  OK. And keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over, you'll only have to cook that side lightly. Put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese. [Person1]:  Wow. That sounds really good. [Person2]:  Mm, it is. [Person1]:  Wow. What fillings do you recommend? [Person2]:  Um, well, if you want to do a real simple one, you can just use some pre-made salsa and cheese, and that's easy, or you can do something like cut up some ham and cheese, onions, tomatoes, mushrooms, anything that you like. If you want to make a spinach omelet then you have to add the cooked spinach to the egg mixture. So it's actually cooked in it. It's inside bacon and sour cream is nice and Jack cheese.
[Person1]:  I'm really glad that you came to see me. [Person2]:  I had to. I was missing you a lot. [Person1]:  I was missing you too. [Person2]:  So, why haven't you visited me? [Person1]:  I've actually been busy lately. [Person2]:  What have you been doing? [Person1]:  I've just been working really hard. [Person2]:  I've also been busy. [Person1]:  Tell me what you've been doing. [Person2]:  Basically, I've been working too. [Person1]:  Well whatever, I'm glad you came. [Person2]:  So am I.
[Person1]:  Are you here for the position advertised in China Daily? [Person2]:  Yes, I am. I'm very interested in that advertisement about hiring a computer program designer, and hope to know a little more about it. [Person1]:  What kind of information would you like? [Person2]:  Well, first I would like to know if this position is still available. [Person1]:  Yes, it's still open. [Person2]:  Terrific! Then how should I apply for? [Person1]:  Oh, we need your resume, health report, three photographs and several letters of recommendation. Would you please send them to us by next Wednesday? [Person2]:  Thank you very much. Bye-bye.
[Person1]:  There must be something weighing on your mind. What is it?  [Person2]:  Dad, I lost mum's necklace. I'm afraid she will scold me.  [Person1]:  Don't worry. I'll buy a new necklace as same as the old one.  [Person2]:  It is so kind of you, Dad. 
[Person1]:  Are you alright, child?  [Person2]:  Hey, I still know my name.  [Person1]:  What did the nurse say?  [Person2]:  She said I have a fever but nothing major.  [Person1]:  In that case, you should go home and get plenty of rest.  [Person2]:  What if this small fever turns into a big fever?  [Person1]:  Then I'll phone our family physician and make an appointment for you. 
[Person1]:  What are you going to do for one year abroad, Tom?  [Person2]:  Study, study, study. I want to learn a lot.  [Person1]:  You are going to take courses?  [Person2]:  Yes. I am going to take some university courses there.  [Person1]:  Sounds hard.  [Person2]:  Yes, but I think it's probably for the best.  [Person1]:  Won't you get lonely?  [Person2]:  Hey, I am a pretty cool guy. I will make friends, and I'll have a lot of extracurricular activities too. You know, like fencing, or theater or something. 
[Person1]:  Can you direct me to some fresh produce that's on sale?  [Person2]:  Well, we've got some great mangoes on sale.  [Person1]:  Mangoes? What are mangoes?  [Person2]:  Well, it's a fruit with a big seed in it.  [Person1]:  Can you eat the seed?  [Person2]:  No. Peel the skin with a sharp knife, and throw out the seed.  [Person1]:  Well, how much are they?  [Person2]:  Well, they're on sale today for only $1 each.  [Person1]:  Can you describe their taste?  [Person2]:  They usually taste sweet, but they remind me of an orange.  [Person1]:  How can I tell if they're ripe?  [Person2]:  You can buy them either ripe or unripe. Unripe ones are hard.  [Person1]:  Where do they grow mangoes?  [Person2]:  The ones that are on sale are from Central America. 
[Person1]:  Does Tom drink a lot?  [Person2]:  Yes, he does. He often has had one to many. But I advised him not to drink too much, he just boasted that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table.  [Person1]:  That's a problem. He has sort of Dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything. 
[Person1]:  Hello, Sir. How can we help you today? [Person2]:  I need to find out some more information for L / C. I would like an outline of responsibilities, both ours, yours and the beneficiary, please. [Person1]:  OK, to start, the conditions are specified by the buyer and may include Insurance Forms, Way Bills, Bills of Lading, Customs forms, various certificates. [Person2]:  OK, got it. Is there anything else I need to know before we go ahead? [Person1]:  Just that in effect, a basic Letter of Credit is a financial contract between the bank, the bank's customer, and the beneficiary, and this contract involves the transfer of goods or services against funds. [Person2]:  That sounds fine, thanks for that. Let's go ahead!
[Person1]:  Hi, Mark! Hi, do you have a minute? [Person2]:  Oh, I'm sorry, Nigel. I'm rushing to a meet right now. [Person1]:  Sure, no problem. Can we fix a time to talk later? [Person2]:  Sure, but this week is crazy for me. Can we make it next Monday? [Person1]:  Ok, see you 10 o'clock next Monday! [Person2]:  That's fine. See you then.
[Person1]:  I am in hot water now, all the things seem to be blown up. [Person2]:  Don't be scared. Bite the bullet and everything will be right again. [Person1]:  Thanks for encouraging me. There are problems cropping up here and there. But I will overcome them one by one.
[Person1]:  How was your date recently? [Person2]:  Not too bad. It is seemingly too hard for me to find a place for our date. [Person1]:  I guess so. Going to watch a movie and having dinner at a restaurant are usual. [Person2]:  She said she wanted to go Dutch in dating. [Person1]:  Yes, now many girls want to be independent, so it is a little popular, especially among white collars. [Person2]:  But I am still traditional, so I felt weird when she paid for herself. [Person1]:  Forget about it! [Person2]:  Are you satisfied with your girlfriend? [Person1]:  It will be a long story. We have many differences, for example, she usually puts all her clothes into washing machine. That is the sort of thing I can not bear.
[Person1]:  Hello? Is this the Maintenance Department? [Person2]:  Yeah. That's right. What can I do for you? [Person1]:  We're having a lot of trouble with our printer. Could you come and take a look at it sometime this afternoon? [Person2]:  Let me see. Yeah, all right. I'll be over about two.
[Person1]:  I'm searching for an old music box. [Person2]:  You came to the right place. Any particular decade? [Person1]:  If you had a box made in the 20's, that would be nice. [Person2]:  We just got one in yesterday, so now we have six. [Person1]:  Would any of them have dancing figures? [Person2]:  Yes, we still have two boxes left that have dancing figures. [Person1]:  Oh, they're both so beautiful. Let me have this one, I think. [Person2]:  That one truly is a beautiful piece of work, isn't it? [Person1]:  One last question [Person2]:  Oh, no. Everything we sell here is ' as is. ' [Person1]:  I guess I was asking for too much. [Person2]:  If it breaks down, maybe you can find a repairman on the Internet.
[Person1]:  Mary, we're going to the supermarket. Do you want to come? [Person2]:  Yeah. I need to get some stuff. [Person1]:  Let's all go together then. [Person2]:  Where's Lisa? [Person1]:  She's getting coupons from her desk. [Person2]:  What are coupons? [Person1]:  They give you discounts on some stuff that you want to buy. [Person2]:  Really? [Person1]:  Because there is a coupon for almost every product, we always bring coupons on our shopping trips.
[Person1]:  Hi, Alan. I feel very nervous because I am going to have a job interview next Monday. Could you please give me some suggestions? [Person2]:  Sure. Firstly, it is very important for you to be punctual. Interviewers usually don't think much of a candidate who comes 5 or 10 minutes late only to explain that he could not find the place or he was stuck in traffic. [Person1]:  Yeah, that is very important. [Person2]:  Secondly, you need to create a good image in a limited time. [Person1]:  I will try my best to make a good impression, but it is always easier said that done. [Person2]:  I think you should make some preparations. For example, you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed. What's more, try to avoid a too causal style. [Person1]:  Can I wear T-shirt and jeans for the job interview? [Person2]:  You'd better not. Informal clothes like sports shirts, tom jeans or dirty sneakers convey the impression that you are not serious about the job, or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes. [Person1]:  I've got it. I think I will wear a white shirt with a tie. Thank you for your suggestions.
[Person1]:  But it's the White House. The president and his family live there. They won't let us see most of it. Probably we can only see a couple of rooms. [Person2]:  No, that's not true. The White House is very big. And there are a lot of historical exhibits there. The tour will take us through many different rooms. I read about it in the guide. [Person1]:  Hmm. If that's true, then the security there must be very good. Because it's strange to think they will let people walk around in the White House. [Person2]:  I'm sure the security is very tight. Probably they will make us walk through metal detectors like at the airport. [Person1]:  So I can't take my gun then. [Person2]:  Don't always joke like that! You don't have a gun. [Person1]:  Yes, it's true I don't. [Person2]:  You shouldn't say things like that. You could get arrested! [Person1]:  What? Do you think someone will arrest me for making a joke? Someone will arrest me here at the breakfast table? [Person2]:  No. But if you say something like that in the White House, they may take it seriously. Sometimes I think you joke too much. [Person1]:  I'll be careful. Don't worry. I don't want to get arrested by the FBI. But how long does the White House tour last? [Person2]:  I'm not sure. I think it lasts about one hour. [Person1]:  Alright. We should take a taxi over there right after breakfast. [Person2]:  First I want to look in the travel guide. Maybe they don't have tours in the morning. [Person1]:  That's a good idea. Do you want some more coffee? [Person2]:  No, I'm fine.
[Person1]:  Airports are sad places. [Person2]:  Sometimes, I guess. But, we'll write to each other. You'll come down at Christmas. [Person1]:  If we can find the money. [Person2]:  Don't worry, Marta. Everything will be taken very good care of. They say that fares are going to be reduced in the next six months. And when I graduate, well ... [Person1]:  That's two years from now. Two years is a long time. [Person2]:  The time will pass quickly. You'll see. I might even be able to go back to New York next summer. [Person1]:  Oh, John, you'll forget all about me. Your mother will find you a nice girl, you will get married with her, and live happily ever after. And you will remember nothing about me... [Person2]:  No, I won't. I swear I won't. Believe me please. [Person1]:  Whatever you say, all I know is that you are going to be taken away from me. [Person2]:  That's ridiculous[ I'll write every day, whether you answer me or not. [Person1]:  Don't be silly. You'll have other things to do. You will be occupied, amd I, and I... [Person2]:  Don't cry, Marta, please.
[Person1]:  Sam, I think it's time for you to get a summer job. When I was your age, I started working at the pool. [Person2]:  Mom, I really don't have time to work this summer. I am going to go to summer school and I need to practice skateboarding. Also, I want to go to the lake with Jeremy. [Person1]:  Well, how are you going to pay to go to the lake? You are getting too old for us to give you money. You're not a young kid anymore! Also, college is very expensive these days. You should start saving money now - college is only three years away! [Person2]:  OK, I'll apply for some jobs this weekend. Can you help me fill out job applications? [Person1]:  Yes, I will help you. You should get an application from the supermarket on Walnut Street. Ms. Jacobs told me they are hiring students this summer.
[Person1]:  Hi, John. What are you doing here? [Person2]:  I'm waiting for the bus. [Person1]:  Where are you going? [Person2]:  I'm going to the station to meet my sister. [Person1]:  Oh, is she coming by herself? [Person2]:  Yes, the train comes in about half past four, but it's twenty past four now. I have only ten minutes! [Person1]:  How often does the bus run? [Person2]:  Every ten minutes. I missed a No. 1 bus 15 minutes ago, and the next one hasn't come yet!
[Person1]:  Say, do you want to go out to dinner tonight? [Person2]:  Sure. Where would you like to go? [Person1]:  Well, what do you think of Italian food? [Person2]:  I love it, but I don't feel like eating it today. [Person1]:  I don't, either. I guess. It's a bit hot. [Person2]:  Hmm...How do you like Japanese food? [Person1]:  Oh, I like it a lot. [Person2]:  I do, too. And I know a nice Japanese restaurant near here. [Person1]:  Oh, I've always wanted to go there. [Person2]:  Great. Let's go.
[Person1]:  What's the story about your new movie? [Person2]:  It's about a police man. And I play the part. He has to catch the killer. The movie has some frightening scenes. But I hope the audience won't be too frightened to go to the movie theaters. [Person1]:  Did you enjoy making the movie? We heard stories of disagreement with other actors or actresses, and with the director. [Person2]:  I have had disagreements with the director I've worked with. We're always disagreed in a friendly way. And we have always made up our decision. But we got on very well and I hope to work with her again. I enjoy making the movie very much. [Person1]:  What do you think of your movie? [Person2]:  The audience said it was great. I care about what they think most. [Person1]:  Did you do your own actions in the movie? [Person2]:  I wanted, too. But my insurance company wouldn't let me do that. All of my dangerous actions were done by another man. As you know, I used to do my own actions, but I'll leave that to people who are good at doing it in the future.
[Person1]:  Now you're my boss, Mr. Henry. [Person2]:  Do you have any other particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration? [Person1]:  No, nothing in particular. [Person2]:  You may ask questions about us, if you have any. [Person1]:  All right. When can I start?
[Person1]:  Susan! Why didn't you tell me that you were taking over the Silk Company account? [Person2]:  I thought you knew, Todd. It was decided last week. I guess you weren't at the meeting. [Person1]:  You know I wasn't at the meeting. I was meeting with Mr. Wei about this account. I'Ve been on this for a month and a half. [Person2]:  I'm sorry. Todd, but Mr. Emory felt that it was going too slowly, and that it needed a fresh start. He should have told you.
[Person1]:  Hi, I'm George. I'll be your waiter this evening. Are you ready to order or do you need a few more minutes? [Person2]:  I'm ready now. I'd like the roast chicken and a side order of corn. [Person1]:  And would you like an appetizer before your meal? The soup of the day is our delicious tomato soup. [Person2]:  I'll pass on the soup, but I'd like a garden salad. [Person1]:  Can I get you anything to drink? [Person2]:  Yes, I'd like a glass of iced tea. [Person1]:  Okay. I'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad. [Person2]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  hi, Lander. What's wrong? [Person2]:  I can hardly make ends meet these days. [Person1]:  same here. I have't brought any new clothes for three months. [Person2]:  my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise. [Person1]:  true. The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities. [Person2]:  definitely. I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month. [Person1]:  the biggest price jump is for pork, so most people have to turn to chicken. [Person2]:  is that inflation? [Person1]:  inflation is more than just the rising prices, I guess. But the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation. [Person2]:  has the government taken some measures to curb it? [Person1]:  yes. The government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy. [Person2]:  but I'm afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy. [Person1]:  you said it. I think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending. [Person2]:  how? [Person1]:  for a start, we can take the public transport to work. You know, running a car is a big expense. [Person2]:  sounds a good idea.
[Person1]:  What are you doing this weekend? [Person2]:  Nothing much. I'm going to the cinema on Friday night but that's all I have planned. [Person1]:  So you're free on Saturday night? [Person2]:  That's right. [Person1]:  Would you like to have dinner with me? [Person2]:  Oh, that would be lovely. Shall we say seven o'clock? [Person1]:  Perfect. I'll pick you up then.
[Person1]:  Come on. Plenty of room upstairs. Fares please! [Person2]:  One to the beach. How much is it? [Person1]:  One dollar. . . I'm short of change this morning. [Person2]:  Sorry. I can wait a moment. [Person1]:  Good, here's your ticket and four dollars change. [Person2]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  My daughter plans to quit her present job and wants to find another. She says she wants to get a better job with higher pay. [Person2]:  It seems quite normal to me. It is pretty much what I want to do. [Person1]:  But what about settling down to start a family? Doesn't anyone want to get married any more? [Person2]:  It is different now. The world is becoming colorful. Some of my friends don't feel the same pressure to marry. We all want to wait for the right moment. [Person1]:  What time is the right moment? [Person2]:  Let the universe find us instead of forcing love. We prefer natural love. The most important thing is to be happy. Love will find us later. That is what we say.
[Person1]:  I can promise you that, if you buy our product, you will be getting A-l quality. [Person2]:  I've looked at your units, and am very happy with them. Your goods are all far above standard quality. [Person1]:  We spend a lot of money to make sure that our quality is much better. We won't sacrifice quality for quick profits. [Person2]:  Well, we're really interested in placing an order under negotiation. We can start the negotiations as soon as you want. [Person1]:  Great, I'm glad we'll be able to do business together. I'll have some quotations ready for you by tomorrow morning. [Person2]:  Fine. As well, would you mind if I asked to see the Loyd's surveyor report of your products? I may have a few more questions about your quality analysis.
[Person1]:  Can I help you? [Person2]:  Wait a minute, please. [Person1]:  Have you made a reservation? [Person2]:  No, I'd like to book a single room with one double bed. [Person1]:  How long will you be staying? [Person2]:  2 nights, how much does it cost? [Person1]:  A single room costs you $ 85 / day. [Person2]:  Does the charge include everything? [Person1]:  Yes. [Person2]:  Do you require a deposit? [Person1]:  No, You can pay when you check out.
[Person1]:  Yeah, but you guys don't stay with the same classmates all day, right? [Person2]:  Right. The people in your math class might not be the people you have science with. [Person1]:  So, you sent out invitations to your whole graduating class? [Person2]:  Yep. And the date is set for homecoming night. [Person1]:  I thought homecoming was a high school dance. [Person2]:  It's a football game the school team plays at home. The dance and reunions are usually that night, too.
[Person1]:  I didn't see you in creative writing class today. What happened? [Person2]:  Oh, just a dentist appointment. That's all. Say, did we get a new assignment for next week? [Person1]:  Yeah. A really interesting one, actually. We're supposed to write a short story that has some sort of limitation or, or, constraints imposed on it. [Person2]:  What do you mean? Like rhyming in a poem? [Person1]:  Well, that'll be an idea. But what we write has to be prose, like prose poetry. Just to make rhyme in a poem is too easy, I guess. I think Prof. Eliot really wants to challenge us, to put our creativity to the test. [Person2]:  Well, did she give any hints about what she has in mind? [Person1]:  Not really, but I may have an idea of the kind of thing she's looking for. I just finished a really strange book by some French guy. He wrote a whole book without even using a single e. [Person2]:  A whole book without a single e? How's it possible? But, wait a minute. I didn't know you can read French. [Person1]:  I can't. I read the English translation. But get this. There's not one e in that either. [Person2]:  No way. Think of the words you couldn't use. [Person1]:  I know, but that translator manages it. I got the book at home if you want to check out for yourself. What's really amazing to me is that leaving e in French is no easy job and doing it in English is gonna involve a complete different group of words. It's a real work of mind. [Person2]:  Sometime you have to show me that book. But right now I'd better get going on the writing for next week.
[Person1]:  I have a problem. [Person2]:  What's the problem? [Person1]:  My mattress was supposed to be delivered today. [Person2]:  Is there a problem? [Person1]:  The delivery people showed up four hours late. [Person2]:  I apologize for their tardiness. [Person1]:  I was late for work because of them. [Person2]:  Again, I do apologize for the inconvenience. [Person1]:  I want my money back for the delivery. [Person2]:  Seeing as they were late, that won't be a problem. [Person1]:  It shouldn't be a problem. [Person2]:  I'm going to refund your money right now.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, please. I seem to have lost my purse. [Person2]:  Oh, I see. Well, I'll have to fill out this lost and found report for you. It was a purse, you say? [Person1]:  That's right. [Person2]:  What is it like, ma'am? [Person1]:  Well, it's a black leather one with my driver's license, some name cards, and about fifty dollars in it. [Person2]:  Where did you last have it? [Person1]:  I'm pretty sure I had it when I was in the coffee shop. [Person2]:  When was that? About 1 [Person1]:  To the shoe department, and then I came here. [Person2]:  I'm sure it will turn up. Now could you give me your name, address and phone number? [Person1]:  Mrs. Jane Thomas, 20 King Street, and my phone number is 89362124.
[Person1]:  Now, could you tell me where the idea for the business first came from? [Person2]:  Well, the original shop was opened by a retired printer by the name of Gruby. Mr. Gruby being left-handed himself, thought of the idea to try to promote a few products for left-handers. [Person1]:  And how did he then go about actually setting up the business? [Person2]:  Well, he looked for any left-handed products that might already be on the market which were very few. And then contacted the manufactures with the idea of having products produced for him, mainly in the scissors range to start with. [Person1]:  Right. So you do commission some part of your stock. [Person2]:  Yes, very much so. About 75 percent of our stock is specially made for us. [Person1]:  And the rest of it? [Person2]:  Hmm, the rest of it now, some 25, 30 years after Mr. Gruby's initial efforts, there are more left-handed product actually on the market. Manufactures are now beginning to see that there is a market for left-handed products. [Person1]:  And what's the range of your stock? [Person2]:  The range consists of a variety of scissors from children scissors to scissors for tailors, hairdressers etc. We also have a large range of kitchen ware. [Person1]:  What's the competition like? Do you have quite a lot of competition? [Person2]:  There are other people in the business now in specialists, but only as mail-order outlets. But we have a shop here in central London plus a mail-order outlet. And we are without any doubt the largest supplier of the left-handed items.
[Person1]:  What are you going to do with your house when you want to move away? [Person2]:  I intend to sell it. Then I decide to rent it. [Person1]:  You think you can get more to rent it than to sell it? [Person2]:  I suppose so.
[Person1]:  Don't talk too much, Tom. We are on duty today, we should hurry up.  [Person2]:  OK.  [Person1]:  Tom, your task is to clean the blackboard.  [Person2]:  How about yourself?  [Person1]:  I'm going to sweep the floor first.  [Person2]:  Daniel, I am not tall enough to reach the end of the blackboard. [Person1]:  Stand on the chair, Pig Tom. Use your brain.  [Person2]:  OK, I've finished cleaning the blackboard.  [Person1]:  How about the podium?  [Person2]:  Oh, I forgot about it. I'll get it.  [Person1]:  Be quick, please. Our teacher and classmates will come soon.  [Person2]:  I will be done before they come. 
[Person1]:  OK Mark, it's your turn to ring the doorbell. I did it last time.  [Person2]:  I hate going door to door, and I hate asking for money.  [Person1]:  But we need to raise enough money for the school fundraiser so that our class can win the pizza party! You do want to have a pizza party, don't you?  [Person2]:  Yes, but. . .  [Person1]:  Just go already!  [Person2]:  No one's coming.  [Person1]:  Try again.  [Person2]:  Maybe there's no one home.  [Person1]:  Of course there's someone home! There are two cars in the driveway and I see lights on in the house! Hello! Anybody home? We would like to know if you want to sponsor us in our school fundraiser. Fifty percent of the profits go towards the new school playground!  [Person2]:  I don't know why anyone would want what's in this catalog anyway. It's just a bunch of tacky Christmas ornaments, Cd's of old people singing Christmas songs, and special crackers and cheeses and boxes of chocolates.  [Person1]:  You don't like chocolates?  [Person2]:  Not this kind. They've got weird names like ganache and praline.  [Person1]:  Look! I just saw someone walking around inside! These people are being very rude! Finally, someone's coming!  [Person2]:  They don't look too happy.  [Person1]:  Hi, sir. Would you like to sponsor us or make a donation to... ?  [Person3]:  What grade are you kids in?  [Person1]:  Grade seven.  [Person3]:  Then for goodness sake, don't you see this sign? Can't you read?  [Person1]:  No soliciting. 
[Person1]:  Hey, Jeffrey! Why don't you take this pensonality survey? I'll tell you what kind of person you are. [Person2]:  I'm the kind of person who doesn't like personality surveys. [Person1]:  Oh, come on Jeffrey! I'd read to you. [Person2]:  Alright, go ahead. [Person1]:  Question one says, 'Do you think of yourself as lazy or hard working?' I can probably answer that for you. [Person2]:  OK, I know I am lazy. I don't like to work too hard, especially around the house. [Person1]:  You're right about that. Next question, are you more frequently patient or impatient? [Person2]:  Umm, I'd say, I'm patient, especially when I have to wait for you. [Person1]:  That's true. I guess I don't have to ask the next question. I already know you're fun-loving. [Person2]:  Let me see that. Is that question 3? Yeah, I'd say that's correct. I love dancing. A good party! [Person1]:  And the answer to the next one is stubborn. [Person2]:  What? I'm quite open. I always listen to your suggestions. [Person1]:  I don't think so, but let's go to the next question. Well, you're definitely not talkative. [Person2]:  That's true. It's because I'm so shy. [Person1]:  That's the next question. In most situations are you shy or outgoing? [Person2]:  Definitely shy. I'm not too comfortable meeting new people. [Person1]:  Umm, I don't think that's true but I'll circle it. Let me see, questions 7 asks if you are an organized person. [Person2]:  Umm, no. My desk at work is always a mess. [Person1]:  I'm glad you're honest about that. Finally, do you consider yourself creative or unimaginative? [Person2]:  I wouldn't say creative. I'm not very good at writing or painting, that sort of thing. [Person1]:  I think your creative. But if you don't think so, I'll put down unimaginative.
[Person1]:  Tell me about yourself. [Person2]:  I was born and raised in Beijing. I attended Peking University and received my bachelor's degree in Economics. I have worked for 2 years as a financial consultant in Beijing for China Pacific Insurance Co. Ltd. [Person1]:  What type of position are you looking for? [Person2]:  I'm looking for a position in which I can utilize my experience. [Person1]:  Are you interested in a full-time or part-time position? [Person2]:  I am more interested in a full-time position. However, I would also consider a part-time position. [Person1]:  Can you tell me about your responsibilities at your last job? [Person2]:  I advised customers on financial matters. After I consulted the customer, I completed a customer inquiry form and catalogued the information in our database. I then collaborated with colleagues to prepare the best possible package for the client. The clients were then presented with a summarized report on their financial activities that I formulated on a quarterly basis. [Person1]:  What is your greatest strength? [Person2]:  I am an excellent communicator. People trust me and come to me for advice. One afternoon, my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well. I made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together. [Person1]:  What is your greatest weakness? [Person2]:  I tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied. However, I began setting time-limits for myself. [Person1]:  Why do you want to work for our company? [Person2]:  After following your firm's progress for the last 3 years, I am convinced that your company is becoming one of the market leaders and I would like to be a part of that team. [Person1]:  When can you begin? [Person2]:  Immediately.
[Person1]:  Hi Joe, how are you doing today? [Person2]:  Things are going good today. How have you been doing, Mary? [Person1]:  Things are going well for me, Joe. [Person2]:  Want to go see a movie tonight? [Person1]:  My parents are taking me to dinner tonight. [Person2]:  Could you go with me to the movies on Friday night, instead? [Person1]:  What movie did you want to see? [Person2]:  There is a new horror flick about a rapist serial killer. [Person1]:  I was thinking that I would like to see ' The Secret Life of Bees. ' [Person2]:  Oh great! Sounds like something I need to bring Kleenex to!
[Person1]:  Good morning! I am a new comer in our office. [Person2]:  Good morning! Welcome to our office! [Person1]:  Nice to meet you! My name is Grace Williams. [Person2]:  Nice to meet you too! I am Peter Smith. [Person1]:  Today is my first day at work! [Person2]:  Well, hope you will enjoy your first day! Just ask me if you need any help. [Person1]:  Thank you. It's very kind of you. [Person2]:  You are welcome.
[Person1]:  Hello. Is this Ann? [Person2]:  Yes, it is. Kelly? [Person1]:  Yes, it's me. [Person2]:  Do you have a cold? [Person1]:  No. Worse than that. I have a flu. I'm in bed with a fever. [Person2]:  Oh, no! What about your presentation today? [Person1]:  I'd like to do it, of course. But I just can't. I'm afraid I'd fall down in the middle of it. [Person2]:  I understand. What should I tell Mr. Morley? [Person1]:  Why not just tell him I'm sick? I'll ring him myself this afternoon. [Person2]:  Alright. Have you been to see a doctor? [Person1]:  Not yet. I feel too lousy to go out. Anyway, I have a flu. I know what it is. I don't need a doctor to tell me that. [Person2]:  Do you think you'll be able to come in tomorrow? Or should I call off your appointments for tomorrow too? [Person1]:  I'm not sure yet. Maybe this will all be gone in a day. So it's probably better if you don't call off my appointments. I will call you later this afternoon and tell you what I think. [Person2]:  It's rainy weather today. Maybe it's better if you just stay inside. Make yourself some chicken soup and sleep. [Person1]:  Yes, that's what I plan to do. Except I won't make the chicken soup. Right now I don't think I could swallow more than a spoonful of it. [Person2]:  That bad, huh? [Person1]:  Yeah, I'm very nauseous. It's mostly nausea and a fever. [Person2]:  Well, I'll cancel your appointments for today. And I'll tell Mr. Morley. [Person1]:  Thanks, Ann. Talk to you this afternoon. [Person2]:  Hope you feel better.
[Person1]:  What are the seasons like in your city? [Person2]:  Summers are hot and usually lasts a long time. Winters are short, but cold, wet, and windy. I love the summers in my city, but I hate the wintertime. [Person1]:  Does it ever rain in summer? [Person2]:  We usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks, but apart from that, summers are dry. Thunderstorms make the air fresh again, so most people don't mind then. [Person1]:  What are spring and autumn like? [Person2]:  I like spring because flowers bloom and trees grow leaves again. In spring, the weather is very changeable-sometimes cold, sometimes warm. It's usually windy with some rain. Autumn is usually sunny and dry, but it's gradually gets colder as winter arrives. What are the seasons like in you city? [Person1]:  Well, I live in the southern hemisphere, so our summertime is your wintertime, and vice versa. We get some rain in every season, but most is in winter. In winter, it sometimes gets cold, but our winters are usually quite mild. Summers are warm, but not hot. Spring and autumn are both very short-sometimes just a few weeks each. The weather is very changeable then-just like spring in your city. [Person2]:  Do you usually go on a summer holiday? [Person1]:  No, I don't. I go on a winter holiday instead. I go somewhere warm. [Person2]:  I usually go on holiday during the spring or the autumn. I try to go somewhere where the weather is more reliable than in my city.
[Person1]:  Hello, are you interested in this Honda? [Person2]:  Hi, I am just looking. [Person1]:  It's a good car. [Person2]:  What year is it? [Person1]:  1999. [Person2]:  How about the mileage? [Person1]:  6, 000 miles, all highway mileage. [Person2]:  What do you mean 7B [Person1]:  Highway miles are not as bad as local miles. They do not hurt car as much. [Person2]:  Oh, why such a high mileage? [Person1]:  The owner was commuting everyday crossing the state line. [Person2]:  Okay. Does this car have a warranty? [Person1]:  One month. [Person2]:  How do I make sure I am not buying a junk? [Person1]:  You'll check it out anyway you want. You can take it to a garage. [Person2]:  How much is it? [Person1]:  $ 5, 900. [Person2]:  I'll have to think about it. [Person1]:  Leave your phone number, and I will give you a call if the price gets reduced. [Person2]:  Okay.
[Person1]:  Have you heard about the robbery? [Person2]:  I saw the whole thing happen. [Person1]:  For real? [Person2]:  I was in the bank during the robbery. [Person1]:  What went down? [Person2]:  Some dude came into the bank with a gun. [Person1]:  Are you serious? [Person2]:  When he pulled out the gun, I got so scared. [Person1]:  Tell me what else happened. [Person2]:  He got the money and tried to leave. [Person1]:  Did the cops get him? [Person2]:  The cops arrested him before he could even make it out the door.
[Person1]:  Is your application successful? [Person2]:  Yes, they notify me to work next week. [Person1]:  Where on earth will you work in? [Person2]:  It is a pretty big mechanical company. I am assigned to work in the assembly shop. [Person1]:  How long will you work a day? [Person2]:  My working hours aren't fixed, sometimes I do the day shift, sometimes the night shift. In all, about 8 hours. [Person1]:  That's rather hard. [Person2]:  But it matches my major. [Person1]:  How will you get your pay? [Person2]:  My wage depends on production results. [Person1]:  What sort of welfare facilities does your company provide? [Person2]:  The company provides labor insurance for all employees, as well as fine retirement policy. [Person1]:  Is there a union? [Person2]:  There is the company union, but it really shares the same aims as the management. [Person1]:  So you must consider dearly before you go to work. [Person2]:  I will.
[Person1]:  Are you tired of driving? [Person2]:  No, I'm doing fine. [Person1]:  What did I do with my briefcase? [Person2]:  Isn't it on the back seat? [Person1]:  No, I don't see it. All my important papers are in it. [Person2]:  You may have left it at the hotel. Should we turn around and go hack? [Person1]:  Well, I guess we ought to go back, if you don't mind. [Person2]:  I'll turn off at the next road.
[Person1]:  I just received an Email from one of my former classmates. I was surprised. I hadn't heard from him for ages. [Person2]:  Well, I've been out of touch with most of my old friends. Only one or two still drop me a line occasionally.
[Person1]:  Oh, it's broken! Jacky is not going to be happy when he sees this. It's his favorite CD! He'll tell mum. [Person2]:  Please Kathy, can I borrow ten dollars? I'll buy him a new one and I will clean up your room.
[Person1]:  Millions of amateur investors like you, have to rely on a dizzying array of financial newspapers, magazines and commentators to get investment information.  [Person2]:  Yes. It's sometimes scary if you think of the tremendous amount of media we face every day.  [Person1]:  It's like information overload , not to mention the reliability of these papers and magazines.  [Person2]:  Which financial magazines and newspapers do you think do the best job of checking facts?  [Person1]:  Well, for example, The Wall Street Journal is very, very good. Even though it's used on occasion ( as all news organizations are) by CEOs or bankers who leak their mergers in advance in order to get a positive spin.  [Person2]:  I like to read Fortune.  [Person1]:  Cood. Fortune is usually ahead of the curve. And Business Week is very solid , too.  [Person2]:  Where does a broadcast company get most of their information? I hope it's not just from press releases.  [Person1]:  A good broadcast company usually does far more than press releases. Their people go out and do real reporting, talking to people at the stock exchange , fund managers, analysts, etc.  [Person2]:  But sometimes when a flimsy report, or even a rumor gets on television , there's going to be a terrible 'echo chamber' effect.  [Person1]:  You are right about that. 
[Person1]:  Excuse me. Could you help me?  [Person2]:  Certainly. What can I do for you?  [Person1]:  I'm looking for a leather belt for my husband.  [Person2]:  Do you know what size he wears?  [Person1]:  Size 36. . . I think.  [Person2]:  And what color would you like?  [Person1]:  Dark brown,if you have it.  [Person2]:  Okay. Let's see. . . a size 36 dark brown leather belt. Oh,yes. Her e we are. Do you think your husband will like this one?  [Person1]:  Yes. I'm sure he will. I'll take it.  [Person2]:  Will this be cash or charge?  [Person1]:  Do you take Master Card?  [Person2]:  No,I'm afraid not. We only accept our own store credit card.  [Person1]:  Oh. In that case,I'll pay cash. 
[Person1]:  Daniel, you can't spit the gum everywhere.  [Person2]:  Come on, just a little piece.  [Person1]:  Do you know how many people chew gum everyday?  [Person2]:  I have no idea.  [Person1]:  Just in Beijing, people consume 300, 000 pieces of gum every day.  [Person2]:  That's amazing.  [Person1]:  If all the people spit out the gum like you, the whole world would become a big trash can.  [Person2]:  Come on, you are making too big deal out of this.  [Person1]:  I just want to remind you to behave yourself.  [Person2]:  OK, dear sister, I see. This kind of thing will not happen again. 
[Person1]:  I'm surprised to see you here. Jeremy told me that you were on vacation. [Person2]:  Yeah. We were visiting some relatives in Sydney, but we return last night. [Person1]:  Oh, I've wanted to go to Australia ever since I was little. Tell me what it was like. [Person2]:  It was wonderful. We fed kangaroos, walkthrough rainforests and swam in the ocean. What was really great was when we took a train to Brisbane to see the Great Barrier Reef. [Person1]:  I've heard that flights to Australia are pretty expensive. [Person2]:  One of my dad's friends know someone who works for the airline, so we were able to get a good deal. The tickets were only $800 per person for a round trip. [Person1]:  Wow! That is a good deal. When my cousin and I went on vacation to Bangkok last year, it cost $1000 for a round trip ticket and Thailand's closer than Australia.
[Person1]:  It's too hot. I'm not sure I can walk anymore. [Person2]:  Oh, come on, you're not so old. I want to go to Monkey Island. [Person1]:  Great. Let's go. I love monkeys. That's why I started dating with you. [Person2]:  You're very funny today. As for me, I've always loved elephants and bears. I like their smell. Maybe that's why I chose you. [Person1]:  Hahaha, I wish we could get some iced coffee somewhere. [Person2]:  Yes, then I could buy you a coffee. [Person1]:  Thanks. Hey, look at that polar bear. [Person2]:  Oh, terrible. I can't believe they have him out in the sun like this. Isn't it too hot? [Person1]:  It's sad. Sometimes I think zoos should treat animals better than they do. [Person2]:  Definitely. They should have him in the air conditioning. They should give him a nice pool to swim in. [Person1]:  They should let him have an iced coffee, too. [Person2]:  You're thinking about yourself again. [Person1]:  Just like him, I'm too hot. Both he and I are sick of Southern California. [Person2]:  Why not move to Alaska? [Person1]:  Sounds good. When I graduate, I will move away to Alaska. And I will take the bear with me. We will open an iced coffee cafe. [Person2]:  That's interesting. Hopefully, you will make it. [Person1]:  So where is that Monkey Island? [Person2]:  Over this way. Follow me.
[Person1]:  Yes, madam? Can I help you? [Person2]:  Oh, yes, please. But you are just closing, aren't you? [Person1]:  Well, yes, we are, madam. The shop shuts down in five minutes. [Person2]:  I shall not keep you long then. It was about some saucepans you had in your window last week. [Person1]:  Last week, madam? I really can't remember which ones you mean. What were they like? [Person2]:  Oh, they were lovely. Sort of imitation wood, dark brown color, country-style you know, and the lids, if I remember rightly, they had a sort of leaf pattern, or was it flowers? [Person1]:  That's strange. I don't recognize any of the ones we had from that description. Are you sure they were in this shop? [Person2]:  Oh, you must know the ones I mean. They were on sale, a real bargain. Reduced to a quarter of the original price. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw them. [Person1]:  I am afraid the sales are over now, madam. And you know we all sold out of the saucepans. [Person2]:  I don't think you did, you know. My neighbor told me she saw some here only yesterday. [Person1]:  Well, it's all new stock in the window now. [Person2]:  May I just have a look, to see if there is anything else? [Person1]:  Eh, well, madam, as you know we are closing. [Person2]:  Yes, yes, I am sorry I won't keep you. It must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time. But they were such beautiful saucepans. I ' d have bought them if I had made up my mind on the spot. [Person1]:  Perhaps madam, if you come back tomorrow, I could show you the whole range of kitchen ware. And there are still one or two things at the sale price. [Person2]:  Oh, look! That was the one there. That is the sort of thing I was looking for. But it's not quite the color. [Person1]:  That might be the artificial lighting, madam. Of course, if you could come back in daylight, you might find it ' s exactly what you are looking for. [Person2]:  There it is. That is the pattern! The set behind you. Thank goodness, they haven't been sold. And thank you so much for being so patient with me. Yes, those are the ones.
[Person1]:  What's up, buddy? You look so upset. [Person2]:  I just broke up with a girl. Why didn't she understand that I loved her? [Person1]:  I'm sorry to hear that. What's your conflict? [Person2]:  I don't know. She always said I didn't love her, but I did. [Person1]:  Did you think about talking to her again? Maybe she is waiting for your call. [Person2]:  I have asked for a talk again, but she refused and said she wanted to be quiet. [Person1]:  Come on, guy. Maybe she isn't your right person.
[Person1]:  Hey, Leo. How come you look so terrible? What's going'on? [Person2]:  You can say that again. Susan'brother dropped in from out of town, so I offered to put him up for a few days. But he's driving me up a wall. This guy is bottomless pit. [Person1]:  How gross! I can't handle people like that. Does he at least give you a hand around the house? [Person2]:  He doesn't lift a finger! I bend over backwards cleaning up all day and he sleeps in until noon. [Person1]:  Man, what a freeloader. You better do something quick or he'll never hit the road. After all, he's got it made in the shade here. [Person2]:  You think he might stay even longer? ! [Person1]:  Now, don't go losing your temper. If you tolerated all you can, just kick him out. . . but do it with gloves. I know! Tell him a white lie like you're getting the house fumigated! [Person2]:  That wouldn't be a lie!
[Person1]:  Good morning, sir. Can I help you? [Person2]:  I'm due to check out tomorrow, but I'd like to extend my stay by two days. [Person1]:  Could I have your name and room number? [Person2]:  Tom Black in Room 207. [Person1]:  Please wait a moment, Mr. Black. I'll have to check the reservation records. . . I'm sorry, but we are expecting several tour groups to arrive today. They have booked all the rooms on the 10th floor. [Person2]:  What can be done then? [Person1]:  If you don't mind transferring to another room, we may manage it for you. We usually have cancellations or no-shows. [Person2]:  That's quite all right. Thank you. [Person1]:  It's my pleasure.
[Person1]:  Hey, Daniel, how's it going? [Person2]:  Hey, Daddy, today I had really a fantastic history class. [Person1]:  Wow, it's so strange for you to say things like that. What had happened? [Person2]:  We've learnt the story of Zheng He Sailing to West Ocean. He is a real great navigator. [Person1]:  Did your teacher tell you the route he took? [Person2]:  Yeah, he, with his fleet, came across the Indian Ocean, and arrived at the east coast of Africa. [Person1]:  Great, do you still remember when he started his voyage? [Person2]:  Of course, that is from 1405 to 1433, which is in Ming dynasty. [Person1]:  Good, by the way, do you finish reading the book Robinson Crusoe I've bought for you? [Person2]:  Not yet, you know I have a lot of homework to do. [Person1]:  You should speed up, because the story of Robinson can give you a better understanding about what you learned today. [Person2]:  OK, great Daddy, after supper, I'll embark on it. [Person1]:  That's my boy! Wait, Daniel, when is Pirates of the Caribbean on? [Person2]:  Is it about Captain Jack Sparrow, who wants to find the treasure on the sea? [Person1]:  Exactly, now, tell me the time. [Person2]:  I won't tell you, unless you promise to let me watch it with you.
[Person1]:  Where do you work, Andrea? [Person2]:  I work for Thomas Cook Travel. [Person1]:  Oh, really? What do you do there? [Person2]:  I'm a guide. I take people on tours to countries in South America, like Peru. [Person1]:  That sounds interesting! [Person2]:  Yes, it's a great job. I love it. And what do you do? [Person1]:  I'm a student, and I have a part-time job, too. [Person2]:  Oh? Where do you work? [Person1]:  In a fast-food restaurant. [Person2]:  Which restaurant? [Person1]:  Hamburger Heaven.
[Person1]:  How many do you intend to order for our shirts? [Person2]:  What's the minimum quantity of an order for your goods? [Person1]:  We are not interested in small orders. I suggest you order at least 2 000 dozen. [Person2]:  No problem. We want a minimum of 1, 000 dozen of men's shirts and a minimum of 3, 000 dozen of embroidered shirts. Can you guarantee continuous production and adequate supply? [Person1]:  Yes, of course. We have enough productivity. You can rest assured. [Person2]:  And for such a big quantity, you should give us a discount. [Person1]:  Sure, we can reduce our price by ten percent. [Person2]:  That's great.
[Person1]:  Can you believe that Susan got married? [Person2]:  Really? I remember she said if she would remain single. Is the man very rich? [Person1]:  No. That's what is surprising me. [Person2]:  You means she didn't marry a rich man. [Person1]:  He's a postman. [Person2]:  I thought she would marry a fortune.
[Person1]:  I am calling to apply to work in your agency of entry. [Person2]:  OK. Do you have any advantages to work in our entry agency? [Person1]:  Yes. I know many ambassadors in Chinese Embassy and British Embassy in China. [Person2]:  Wonderful, I will give you a chance of interview.
[Person1]:  OK. sir. Your room is done. Is there anything else I can do for you? [Person2]:  Would you please help me send these clothes to the laundry? [Person1]:  OK. sir. [Person2]:  When will they be ready? [Person1]:  All the laundry will be ready by 5 [Person2]:  That's fine. Thank you.
[Person1]:  Zhu, how do you like this coat? [Person2]:  Come on, George. Isn't that color too bright for me? [Person1]:  Then how about this one? [Person2]:  Oh, I'm afraid this color is too light. It easily gets dirty. [Person1]:  Well, well, Zhu, you're being a bit difficult. [Person2]:  What would you say if I buy this one? [Person1]:  It's nice. Try it on. Now you look quite smart, but doesn't it feel a bit tight at the shoulders? [Person2]:  Yeah. Let's see if there's a larger size. Well, they don't seem to have anything larger. [Person1]:  Why don't we go and ask that salesgirl over there? I think she can help us.
[Person1]:  I have no idea what to buy for Mary for her birthday. [Person2]:  Me neither! Would you like to go in and buy her a gift together? [Person1]:  Yes, that would be good! [Person2]:  We need to think about what she might like. What are her interests? [Person1]:  If I remember right, she likes music, skiing, and reading. [Person2]:  You know, maybe we could get her some concert tickets. Who would know her favorite groups? [Person1]:  Her roommate, Malia, might know what her favorite groups are. [Person2]:  Yeah, Malia would be able to help us choose a concert. [Person1]:  Let's give Malia a call and ask her for her help right now. [Person2]:  Good! Maybe Malia would like to go in with us on this gift.
[Person1]:  Please turn on the air conditioner. The temperature is 39C today. [Person2]:  All right. But I think it might be cooler outside at this time of the day. Many people are doing their morning exercises outdoors now. [Person1]:  What do you mean? [Person2]:  I suggest you do the same.
[Person1]:  Mary, this is Mike. Listen, Jerry and I wanted to go bowling tomorrow night, but we don't have a way to get there. If you drive, we'll pick up the tab for the bowling. How about it? [Person2]:  Well, it sounds like fun. But actually I've really got a lot of homework to do just now. [Person1]:  Oh, come on, Mary. It'll be fun. Make you relax. You'll study better. [Person2]:  I really can't. I've got a chemistry exam on Monday. And a book report due on Tuesday which I'm really getting nervous about. I don't think I'd enjoy it much. But thanks a lot for thinking of me. Sorry, I can't help you out. [Person1]:  Oh, don't worry about it.
[Person1]:  I've been waiting here in the conference room for ten minutes already. What time does our meeting start? Where is everyone anyway? [Person2]:  Didn't you hear about that? Our meeting was proponed until Friday. [Person1]:  What? The meeting was proponed? No one told me anything about it. [Person2]:  Didn't you get the memo? [Person1]:  What memo? There haven't been any memos this whole week. I check my unbox every day, and I haven't seen anything. [Person2]:  The memo went out three days ago. It should have made it to your in-box, but maybe it got lost in all the clutter on your desk. [Person1]:  You know how things get piled up on my desk when I am busy, I know that sometimes I do misplace things, but I always read all the memos that go around. They go directly to my in-box. Are you sure it was sent to the whole office? [Person2]:  It should have gone around to everybody. They also posted a copy of the memo in the break-room. Don't you ever look at the messages posted on the bulletin board? [Person1]:  I'm usually too busy to take a bunch of coffee breaks and gossip by the water cooler. Anyway, I am sure the memo never got to my in-box. I'll have to talk to our secretary about it. [Person2]:  That's right. You never know what you're missing out if you don't read the memos.
[Person1]:  Hello, mom. [Person2]:  Hello, Dan. Have you arrived in your office? [Person1]:  Yes, I have. [Person2]:  Are your shoes totally wet? The rain was so heavy when you went out for work. [Person1]:  Yes, but don't worry about it. I have bought a new pair of socks. They make me feel better. [Person2]:  I think you need a pair of rain shoes. I know your size is 41. But what color do you like? [Person1]:  Well, black is my favorite. [Person2]:  But there is no black rain shoes left. How about the gray ones? [Person1]:  That's alright. Mom, thank you so much. Anyway, you need to go back home now. It's going to snow according to the weather forecast. I know your legs feel painful in the wet weather. Take care of yourself. [Person2]:  I know.
[Person1]:  You look tired. Didn't you get enough sleep last night? [Person2]:  No, I had a bunch of friends over and we partied until midnight. [Person1]:  No wonder you look so bad. [Person2]:  I guess I just can't take late nights like I used to. My head is spinning. [Person1]:  I think you need to go home and take a rest. [Person2]:  I wish I could, but I don't think I can keep my eyes open long enough to drive home. [Person1]:  Don't worry. I'll give you a ride home.
[Person1]:  This looks like a very nice house. [Person2]:  You know, I fell in love with this house the first moment I laid eyes on it. [Person1]:  The style of the exterior is just what I ' Ve been looking for! [Person2]:  The exterior is only half of the story. The interior is incredible. [Person1]:  This home is gorgeous on the inside! [Person2]:  Everything that you see on the walls, floors, and windows is brand new. [Person1]:  The wall colors totally suit the style of this house. [Person2]:  Straight ahead is the gourmet kitchen. [Person1]:  I love the bamboo flooring and granite countertops. [Person2]:  The master suite is the best. Let ' s go look at that next. [Person1]:  There is plenty of room for our king-sized bed, and I love the light in this room. [Person2]:  I know that you like this house, but let ' s take a look at the others before you make up your mind.
[Person1]:  Hello, this is the admissions office. Can I help you? [Person2]:  Hi. I'm calling about your continuing education program. [Person1]:  What would you like to know? [Person2]:  I want to become certified in computer programming. Do you offer any part-time courses for adult further education? [Person1]:  Yes, we offer both night and weekend courses in a number of different subjects. [Person2]:  How do I sign up? [Person1]:  If you give me your address, I can mail you an information packet and the application forms. [Person2]:  Great!
[Person1]:  Can you give me a hand with some things in the kitchen? I don't think I can finish everything in time. [Person2]:  Ok, what do you want me to do? [Person1]:  First of all, I need you to do the drying up. I'm almost finished the washing up. I'm going to clean the cooker when I finish. [Person2]:  Ok. I'll put the plates and cutlery away as I dry them. Where is the tea towel? Oh, here it is. [Person1]:  We'll have this finished in no time with two if us working on it. [Person2]:  While you're cleaning the cooker, I'll wipe the worktop. That was a great meal, by the way. [Person1]:  Actually, it was just some leftovers from yesterday. I made far too much food to eat alone. I am glad you could come over to help me finish it. [Person2]:  My pleasure! This tea towel's a little ragged. Do you have another one? [Person1]:  Yes. Look in that drawer. I should throw the old one out. [Person2]:  Keep it and use it as rag. You can clean your bicycle with it.
[Person1]:  Too. . . your face is really oily. . . perfect! [Person2]:  Why? Are you planning to stir-fry my face? [Person1]:  Nope. I'm going to tell your fortune. So. . . the oilier, the better. [Person2]:  You've gone bonkers, Jen. [Person1]:  It's facial paper, and it fits into the rings of my binder! It's magical. [Person2]:  OK. Let's see. Give me a sheet.
[Person1]:  Your house is too small. Why not buy a big one. [Person2]:  I do wish I could afford one. [Person1]:  You can get a loan from the bank. You know LPF program provides low cost loans for participants home purchases. [Person2]:  Of course I know that. But don't you notice that the house price is skyrocketing?
[Person1]:  Tom, you promised to cut the lung. You won't forget, will you? [Person2]:  No, I assure you. [Person1]:  And you'll repair the television, won't you? [Person2]:  Ok. [Person1]:  Do you promise? [Person2]:  Of course. [Person1]:  And Tom, you will help Johnny with his homework, won't you? [Person2]:  I'll see. I will if I can but I won't promise. [Person1]:  But you'll promise not to be late for dinner tonight, won't you? [Person2]:  Yes. But only if you ask me nicely. [Person1]:  Tom, darling. You'll try not to be late for dinner tonight, won't you? Please! [Person2]:  Ok. I'll keep my promise.
[Person1]:  Print shop. Seam speaking. [Person2]:  Hi, Sean. It's Mary in Mr. Emory's office. I placed an order for 1, 000 bound copies of a staff manual last week. [Person1]:  It usually takes 2 to 3 weeks to complete a job like that. [Person2]:  Well, I was hoping you would do me a big favor. That was supposed to be a rush order, I forgot to tell you. I'm getting a lot of flak from my boss.
[Person1]:  Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? [Person2]:  I am a graduate of a technical university and have been employed as a technician with Company  for approximately 10 years. [Person1]:  Please explain why you are interested in leaving your current position and please elaborate on your technical skills. [Person2]:  I am looking for a growth opportunity, which I feel is not available at my current employer. In terms of skills, I am Microsoft certified in Windows XP and several other operating systems. [Person1]:  Where do you see yourself five years from now? [Person2]:  I see myself in a management position.
[Person1]:  The mailboxes are right down there, and the laundry room with coin-operated washers and dryers is over there. [Person2]:  I see. Well, it's nothing spectacular, but it's pretty cheap for an apartment in a decent neighborhood. . . O. K. , I think I'll take it. [Person1]:  All right, do you want to sign a nine-month or a one-year lease? [Person2]:  I think I'll sign a nine-month lease in case I decide not to go to summer school. I can extend it if I want to stay, can't I? [Person1]:  Sure. Just let us know before your lease expires.
[Person1]:  Jenny, you're too lazy. You should do some exercise. See, you're getting fat. [Person2]:  Dad, it's raining outside. [Person1]:  That is your excuse. [Person2]:  All right, all right, I will go swimming with Peter this afternoon. [Person1]:  Not just today. Go exercise everyday!
[Person1]:  Your chemistry examination is over, isn't it? Why do you still look so worried? [Person2]:  I don't know. It wasn't that the questions were too hard, or they were too many of them. But I'm still feeling uneasy because the exam didn't seem to have much to do with the course material.
[Person1]:  Welcome, how may I help you today?  [Person2]:  I'm ask for a pizza, please.  [Person1]:  Then you will be happy to here that today all our pizzas are on sale. Two for one.  [Person2]:  You're right, that is great.  [Person1]:  What size would you like?  [Person2]:  Medium one will be perfect, thank you  [Person1]:  Which kind do you want?  [Person2]:  I like seafood on my pizza.  [Person1]:  We have two seafood pizzas. Tuna and crab.  [Person2]:  Tuna sounds good today.  [Person1]:  Would that be for here or take away?  [Person2]:  That would be to go.  [Person1]:  That'll be in a ten minutes. Please sit over there, and I'll call you over as sooner as it's ready.  [Person2]:  No problem. 
[Person1]:  what a nice uniform!  [Person2]:  thanks; do you like it?  [Person1]:  not really. I was being sarcastic. Does it come with the job?  [Person2]:  yes, everyone on the sales floor has to wear one. They're supposed to make us look more professional.  [Person1]:  they're not actually that bad. They could be worse. What do you think about it?  [Person2]:  I don't mind it, actually. I don't have to worry about what I'm going to wear every day.  [Person1]:  so are you enjoying your new job?  [Person2]:  it's much better than my old one. My new boss is great.  [Person1]:  how do you like working in sales?  [Person2]:  I like the fact that I get to work with people. It makes the day go by much faster.  [Person1]:  that's good. Have you met Jane yet? She's the intern in the international travel department.  [Person2]:  yeah, I've met her. She's a genius saleswoman!  [Person1]:  I know! She could sell fridges to Eskimos!  [Person2]:  how do you know her?  [Person1]:  she's my cousin.  [Person2]:  why didn't you tell me about that before?  [Person1]:  I don't know. I didn't think it was that interesting.  [Person2]:  well, now that I know that, maybe we should all go out for dinner sometime.  [Person1]:  that's a good idea. Let's discuss after work. 
[Person1]:  OK. Steven, you're looking at a picture. Please describe what you see!  [Person2]:  Uh, I can see a red double decker bus. It's the kind of bus you'll see very often in London. In fact I know this bus is from London because I can see the names, Chelsea, Sloan Square, Victoria, Herring Cross. These are all areas in London. Um, so obviously the bus is in London.  [Person1]:  OK. Have you ever been on a double decker bus?  [Person2]:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. many times. Many times. When I was younger, you used to get double-decker all over England but now you only tend to see them in the big cities.  [Person1]:  Oh, really. Mm! How much is the fare?  [Person2]:  Well, it depends on the journey. It's. . I guess it's not too expensive, but the minimum price you would pay is, for a short journey, is about a pound.  [Person1]:  Mm, yeah, who can you see on the bus? Can you pick out anyone on the bus who looks interesting?  [Person2]:  Hmm, yeah, well this girl here at the back, that's leaning on the door, um, she looks really bored, actually. Maybe she is going to work or something and she doesn't want to go!  [Person1]:  Is that how you feel on the bus?  [Person2]:  Uh, well, no, not really, because I haven't worked in England for a long time, so I haven't taken a bus for a long time.  [Person1]:  So, so you're British, do you missing them?  [Person2]:  Um, yes, sometimes. Sometimes. 
[Person1]:  Hey, Brandon. [Person2]:  Yeah. [Person1]:  Um ... Um ... [Person2]:  What? [Person1]:  Well, I need to talk to you, and I'm not really sure how to do it. It's kind of difficult, but I kind of, I need to talk to you about something. [Person2]:  Alright. Go ahead. [Person1]:  Okay. You know, Stephanie. [Yeah.] You're dating my sister, right? Stephanie. [Yeah, yeah.] Um, I think she's back on drugs. [Person2]:  What do you mean? I, I know she had a problem in the past, but she told me that that was over. [Person1]:  Well, that's what she says, but you know, I know my sister pretty well; I think I know her better than just about anyone else, and I know you guys have talked about getting married soon, and [Yeah] ... I'm pretty sure she's using drugs again, and you really need to, you need to know this ... you really need to face the facts, and you're going to have to deal with this now. [Person2]:  So, but, I ... again, how do you know? [Person1]:  She's doing some of the same stuff, you know, um, like. Well, like. Listen, you know. Um, you've noticed she's been skipping work lately? [Person2]:  Well, she said she's been having some health problems, so I just figured it was that. [Person1]:  No, no, no. She's not. [ Are you sure? ] Yeah. It's, it's more than that. Like, a month ago, she asked me to lend her a thousand bucks to fix her car. [Person2]:  Wow. Man. Um, I mean, she didn't tell me anything like that. I mean, her car is running fine, I think. [Person1]:  Yeah, I know, it is. It's running fine. [ Oh, great. ] Exactly. She's lying a lot now, and she's, you know, she's trying to hide it, and she's good at hiding it. [Person2]:  And, I let her borrow my car a couple days ago, and I had fifty bucks in there, and when the car came back, it was gone. She's ... I don't know how else it could have disappeared. [ Man. I can't belive this. ] I'm pretty sure she stole it. [Person1]:  I know. Um, but she's hiding things, and she hides things from us, and okay, for example, like last week. I saw her with the two cell phones, and when I checked the texts on the one phone .... [Person2]:  Wait, wait. Two phones? What do you mean? [Person1]:  ....Yeah, umm. [Person2]:  She only has one. [Person1]:  No, she's got at least two phones, and when I checked the one phone, I saw some texts, and she was talking about, um, um, some drugs and needing to meet up with someone to buy them. [Person2]:  Ah, man. [Person1]:  I'm sorry, Brandon, um, I ... we need to, we need to confront her on this. You need to confront her on this. [Person2]:  I don't know how to do this. I mean ... yeah, I don't know. [Person1]:  I know, but you've got to. You, you can't ... the ... you know, you've got to do this if you want to try to hope that there's going to be anything to this relationship. It's, it's much better to talk to her openly about this now, cause, I promise you, the problems will just escalate, so ... [Person2]:  But, she might blow up. [Person1]:  She might, but hey, wait, listen. Why don't you guys come over for dinner and we can talk about it together? You know, um ... [Person2]:  I just don't know. [Person1]:  I know, and you're right, she might blow up, but if you don't do anything, I promise the problems are just going to get bigger. She's probably going to end up losing her job, she's probably going to get arrested, and she might even die. [Person2]:  Man, you're probably right. I have to think about this and how to approach her. Alright. Let, let me thing about it, and I'll call you. [ Okay. ] Alright, thanks. [Person1]:  Alright. Bye, Brandon.
[Person1]:  Yes! I finally lost that last five pounds I've been working on forever! [Person2]:  How did you finally do it? [Person1]:  A friend suggested that I stop nibbling between meals. [Person2]:  Like snacking? [Person1]:  You know, a little piece of chocolate here, some chips on the side, candy now and then... [Person2]:  I get what you mean. [Person1]:  Instead, I sit down and have a good snack like a piece of fruit between meals. [Person2]:  I'm impressed. Good for you!
[Person1]:  Come on, you must tell me everything about him. [Person2]:  Well, he's very tall and handsome. [Person1]:  Hmm. . . [Person2]:  He has big blue eyes and long blonde hair. [Person1]:  Oh, how long? [Person2]:  Down to his shoulders. It's beautiful, like gold. [Person1]:  OK. OK. You'd better tell me what he does. [Person2]:  He's a very creative painter. His paintings sell well. [Person1]:  Really? [Person2]:  He's quite a patient teacher, too. [Person1]:  Fine. [Person2]:  You're going to like him. Everybody says he's a nice guy.
[Person1]:  who are you writing a letter to? [Person2]:  I'm just responding to Sue's letter. Do you want to help? [Person1]:  OK. I guess I could add something. Tell them that I send my love. [Person2]:  that's kind of boring. Don't you want to tell them anything else? [Person1]:  well, maybe you could tell them about my promotion. [Person2]:  you've been promoted? when did that happen? [Person1]:  just today. I guess I forgot to mention it. [Person2]:  congratulations! That's really exciting! Let's get out a bottle of wine to celebrate! [Person1]:  shouldn't we finish writing this letter first? [Person2]:  ah. That can wait. Your promotion is the best news I've heard in a long time! [Person1]:  it is good news, but it looked like you were almost finished. We might as well just sign off. [Person2]:  ok, you're right. I'll just tell them how round I am of you for getting a promotion and then I'll thank Sue for her kind letter. [Person1]:  I guess you can write that I'm looking forward to seeing them in June. [Person2]:  that's thoughtful of you. [Person1]:  and also thank them from the bottom of my heart for the Christmas package they sent us. [Person2]:  that's right! I almost forgot about that. [Person1]:  what would you do without me? [Person2]:  we do balance each other out well. I guess we were really made for each other!
[Person1]:  I don't understand why some parents keep beefing and complaining about their daughters not being able to follow suit. [Person2]:  Yeah. Li Na's mother has been building a fire under her since her neighbour's daughter got married with a Canadian. She's almost driving Li Na crazy. [Person1]:  If I were Li Na, I would ask her if she had done that. [Person2]:  She a as meek as a lamb. She never goes against anyone or anything. She's as good as gold, you know?
[Person1]:  Can you tell me what bus to catch from Altadena to downtown LA? [Person2]:  You can catch the 486. [Person1]:  That bus goes all the way to LA? [Person2]:  I believe so. [Person1]:  Is the bus ride long? [Person2]:  It only takes 45 minutes to an hour. [Person1]:  That's all? [Person2]:  It's a pretty short trip. [Person1]:  Is there always a lot of people on that bus? [Person2]:  It only gets crowded once it gets to LA. [Person1]:  Oh okay, thank you. [Person2]:  No problem.
[Person1]:  Good coming. [Person2]:  Good coming. Are you through with the cleaning? If not, we'll come back a little later. [Person1]:  Never mind, come right in. I've almost finished. You always keep the room neat and tidy, I must say. It saves me a lot of work, but you should let me do it. [Person2]:  It doesn't take much time. I'm used to tidying up my room myself. [Person1]:  It's very considerate of you to do so. Do you have any laundry today? [Person2]:  I have a suit that needs cleaning. [Person1]:  Let me have it, please. I'm taking some laundry downstairs anyway.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, sir. But please call an ambulance. My friend suddenly got a sharp pain in the stomach. [Person2]:  Is he all right? There's a big hospital just around the corner. [Person1]:  Oh, is there? Will you find someone to take us to the hospital then? [Person2]:  All right, sir. I'll have someone to take you there. By the way, is he insured? [Person1]:  Yes, he is. [Person2]:  I'm glad to hear that. In case he's not insured, the hospital will never accepts any patient.
[Person1]:  Hi Jane, you look great. [Person2]:  You too. Have you lost some weight? [Person1]:  Yes, I took off 4 kilos. I am glad you notice it. [Person2]:  Not some crazy diet fat I hope. [Person1]:  No no, I just changed my eating habits. I eat a balanced meal. and I eat less than before. [Person2]:  Good for you, keep it up.
[Person1]:  This apartment is wonderful. [Person2]:  I'm glad you like it. [Person1]:  How much would I have to pay for rent? [Person2]:  The rent is $ 1050 each month. [Person1]:  That's way too much money. [Person2]:  It isn't too much. [Person1]:  How about if I pay $ 850? [Person2]:  I can't take that. [Person1]:  I can't go any higher than $ 850. [Person2]:  I honestly don't know what else to tell you. [Person1]:  You can't go any lower than that? [Person2]:  If you can't afford $ 1050, then we have no deal.
[Person1]:  Yes, I need more amenities. [Person2]:  By amenities, exactly what do you mean, please? [Person1]:  You know, the things that are free, like the soap and the shampoo. [Person2]:  Okay, I got it. You've already run out of all your amenities? [Person1]:  No, I still have plenty left, even if I took three baths a day. [Person2]:  I'm more confused now than before. How is there a problem? [Person1]:  I need to take home some souvenirs! [Person2]:  Okay, finally I understand. You would like souvenirs! [Person1]:  Yes, souvenirs that I can take home and add to my collection. [Person2]:  If it's souvenirs you want, sir, just visit our souvenir shop. It has everything. [Person1]:  Are you kidding? Whoever heard of paying for hotel souvenirs? [Person2]:  No problem at all, sir. Housekeeping will deliver you all the amenities you like in a bit.
[Person1]:  I saw your advertisement in the morning paper concerning the XMO model. The lens seems to be excellent and the flash is not bad, but don't you think the price is a little steep? [Person2]:  I think it's a good buy. The price includes the leather case, you know.
[Person1]:  Heat is included unless there's another increase in oil prices. Then the landlord will pass the increase along to you. Now please sign here and here. We'll sign on copy and give it to you. [Person2]:  Perhaps you could give up a few minutes to read the lease, Miss.
[Person1]:  Hello, Pasadena Inn. How may I direct your call? [Person2]:  I'd like to speak to someone about reservations. [Person1]:  I can help you with that. What date would you like to make a reservation for? [Person2]:  We'll be arriving May 12th, but I would like to make reservations for the penthouse. [Person1]:  Oh, I'm sorry sir. I only handle bookings for our standard rooms. The person you need to speak with is Tony Parker, he makes all the arrangements for our executive accounts. Unfortunately, he's not here right now. Can I take your name and number and have him get back to you? [Person2]:  When do you expect him back? [Person1]:  He'll be out all afternoon; he might not be able to return your call until tomorrow. Will that be alright? [Person2]:  Yes, I suppose. My name is Sam Darcy. He can contact me at 660 843 3235. [Person1]:  Could you please spell your last name for me? [Person2]:  Sure. It's D A R C Y. [Person1]:  Okay, Mr. Darcy, and your phone number is 660 843 3233? [Person2]:  That's 3235. [Person1]:  Sorry! 3235. Great. I'll have Tony call you first thing tomorrow morning.
[Person1]:  My parents told me my uncles and aunts are planning a big family reunion in Paris this fall. [Person2]:  Are you going to the reunion? [Person1]:  You bet. All my uncles and aunts will take their children along, too. So I'll meet many cousins there. [Person2]:  How nice! But why Paris? [Person1]:  Because two of my aunts are French. They met and got married to my uncles in France. Some of their relatives are still living there. [Person2]:  Have you ever been to France before? [Person1]:  No. Actually I've never traveled abroad. I'm very excited about it. I just can't wait. [Person2]:  My parents are going to take me on a trip to Hawaii next month by way of Tokyo, but I've been there three times already.
[Person1]:  Hello. 24th Precinct. Officer Jones speaking. [Person2]:  Help. Yeah, uh, it was wild, I mean really bizarre. [Person1]:  Calm down sir! Now, what do you want to report? [Person2]:  Well, I'd like to report a UFO sighting. [Person1]:  A what? [Person2]:  What do you mean 'what?' An unidentified flying object! [Person1]:  Wait, tell me exactly what you saw. [Person2]:  Well, I was driving home from a party about three hours ago, so it was about 2 [Person1]:  Okay. And then what happened? [Person2]:  Oh, man. Well, it was out of this world. I stopped to watch the light when it disappeared behind a hill about a kilometer ahead of me. [Person1]:  Alright. Then what? [Person2]:  Well, I got back in my car and I started driving toward where the UFO landed. [Person1]:  Now, how do you know it was a UFO? Perhaps you only saw the lights of an airplane [No], or the headlights of an approaching car [No]. Things like that happen, you know. [Person2]:  Well if it was that, how do you explain 'the BEAST'? [Person1]:  What do you mean, 'the BEAST'? [Person2]:  Okay. I kept driving for about five minutes when all of a sudden, this giant, hairy creature jumped out in front of my car. [Person1]:  Oh, yeah. Then what? [Person2]:  Well, then, the beast picked up the front of my car and said, 'Get out of the car. I'm taking you to my master!' Something like that. [Person1]:  Wow? A hairy alien who can speak English! Come on! [Person2]:  I'm not making this up, if that's what you're suggesting. Then, when I didn't get out of the car, the beast opened the car door, carried me on his shoulders to this round-shaped flying saucer, and well, that's when I woke up along side the road. The beast must have knocked me out and left me there. [Person1]:  Well, that's the best story I've heard all night, sir. Now, have you been taking any medication, drugs, or alcohol in the last 24 hours? You mentioned you went to a party. [Person2]:  What? Well, I did have a few beers, but I'm telling the truth. [Person1]:  Okay, okay. We have a great therapist that deals with THESE kinds of cases. [Person2]:  I'm not crazy. [Person1]:  Well, we'll look into your story. Thank you.
[Person1]:  I don't enjoy dating anymore. I can't seem to find anyone I have anything in common with. [Person2]:  Don't feel discouraged. Be patient. As you are so distinguished, you will definitely find the person who is right for you. [Person1]:  To tell you the truth, I am tired of being alone. I hope to find my Mrs. Right. What should I do? [Person2]:  Do you believe in Internet matchmaking service? [Person1]:  That's really a new walk of life. What is it exactly? [Person2]:  It helps match up singles the world over, and helps find the man and woman of their dreams. [Person1]:  Oh, it must be to the taste of a certain group of people. [Person2]:  The advertisement said Dream Dates has matched up thousands of singles the world over! [Person1]:  Unbelievable! They must be exaggerating the figure! [Person2]:  Look at the way they manage their business [Person1]:  I don't believe several questions can decide the type of person you're. People's characters are complicated and keep changing all the time. [Person2]:  Anyway, it seems that things work well this way. The information and specifications will be entered in a large computer database. [Person1]:  A computer to decide your best date? That's really ridiculous! [Person2]:  Look, it promises [Person1]:  Sheer slogans! Not reliable! [Person2]:  It says you can enroll in a free trial membership! [Person1]:  I won't do it even they pay me for that! [Person2]:  Well, we don't have to believe this. Maybe I can tell John, and see whether he'd like to try it.
[Person1]:  Hey, Shirley! Want to join me for lunch. . . my treat!  [Person2]:  Wow! Sure!  [Person1]:  I must confess I have an ulterior motive for asking you to lunch.  [Person2]:  Oh. . . . that's OK. . . . as long as you're buying!  [Person1]:  I really want to pick your brain about something I've been thinking a lot about.  [Person2]:  I'd love to help if I can.  [Person1]:  Well, as you know, I have a Bachelor's degree in English literature and that's served me well so far, but I've always wanted to do some post-graduate work. . . maybe even get a Doctorate!  [Person2]:  Wow! Just the idea of going back to school fills my head with pain.  [Person1]:  But you have a Master's degree. . . hasn't that helped your career?  [Person2]:  Yeah, I'd have to say it has. But I'm still paying for it, you know.  [Person1]:  I know education is expensive, but it's been my lifelong dream. Call me crazy, but I've always wanted to have that PhD at the end of my name.  [Person2]:  Well, getting a Doctorate degree would mean close to a decade of school. Can you afford that? Can you survive that?  [Person1]:  I certainly can't afford it, but I'm sure I could find some good student loans.  [Person2]:  I think you need to separate the dream of having a PhD from the reality of years of more schooling. It's not as romantic as you might think.  [Person1]:  Yeah. . . . I keep thinking about what I'll do with a Master's or Doctorate. I love language but I don't think there are a lot of well-paying jobs out there for experts on Shakespeare.  [Person2]:  Uh huh, that's for sure. You might find that your only career choice is teaching other graduate students. 
[Person1]:  Did you go to the concert last weekend?  [Person2]:  No, I didn't. And you? Was it good?  [Person1]:  Yes, I did. I enjoyed it a lot. There was a folk singer, a violinist and a pianist.  [Person2]:  How much was the ticket?  [Person1]:  I only paid two dollars for mine. 
[Person1]:  I had a big argument with david yesterday. I hope he's not still mad at me.  [Person2]:  What did you argue about?  [Person1]:  He borrowed some money from me and I needed it back. He said he didn't have the money yet.  [Person2]:  Well, he should pay you back. It's only fair.  [Person1]:  Yes, but I got angry with him too quickly. He probably thought that I mistrusted him. I shouldn't have got angry.  [Person2]:  Did you lend him a lot of money?  [Person1]:  Not much. I had to pay an unexpected bill, so I needed the money back.  [Person2]:  Well, talk to him about it next time you see him. He probably feels as bad about it as you do. Close friends sometimes have disagreements. It's nothing unusual. Neither of you said anything really nasty, did you?  [Person1]:  No , we didn't. I guess you're right. We should patch things up.  [Person2]:  Of course you should. You wouldn't want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship, would you? 
[Person1]:  George, it's so lovely to see you again. It must be ages since we last met. [Person2]:  Oh, I suppose it is, but weren't you at Michael's birthday party on August twentyth last year? [Person1]:  No, I wasn't. I got the flu at the last minute and I went to the hospital instead. I think the last time I saw you was 3 years ago at Christmas. When we all had dinner together in that Indian restaurant? [Person2]:  No, surely we've met since then. Wait a minute, it was at Peter's place! When he and Jenny got married! [Person1]:  Yes, of course, it was. It was a wonderful wedding.
[Person1]:  How was your interview, Emily? [Person2]:  It was pretty good. Two weeks ago, I had my phone interview with teach for America. And then this weekend, I had the in-person interview. [Person1]:  How was the in-person interview? I heard it's really stressful. [Person2]:  It was. It lasted all day. When we started, we were in a group of 10 people or so. We each had prepared a 5 minute lesson. Then we had to discuss a problem in a group and reach a solution. And finally, we interviewed one on one. It was really a long day. [Person1]:  Yeah, I can imagine. When do you hear back? [Person2]:  They said 3 to 4 weeks. So it's worth waiting. [Person1]:  Have you started looking for jobs yet? Can you believe graduation is only a few months away? [Person2]:  I thought about it. But I get so anxious when I think about the future that I've stopped right now. I'm just going to focus on my studies for a bit longer. Once midterm exams are over, I think I will start again.
[Person1]:  Good morning, sir. Is there a bank near here? [Person2]:  There is one. 5 blocks away from here? [Person1]:  Well, that's too far. Can you change some money for me? [Person2]:  Surely, of course. What kind of currency have you got? [Person1]:  RMB. [Person2]:  How much would you like to change? [Person1]:  1000 Yuan. Here you are.
[Person1]:  Good afternoon. I'd like to speak with Tom Smith. [Person2]:  I'm afraid he's away from his desk at the moment. [Person1]:  Do you know when he will be back? [Person2]:  He's away on a business trip. He won't be back until some time next week. [Person1]:  Is there some way I can get into contact with him? [Person2]:  The best way to reach him is by cell phone. I'll give you his number. [Person1]:  Thanks. And could I have his e-mail, just in case I can't get him by phone? [Person2]:  Sure. His cell phone is 09112223 33. And his e-mail is lower case t, smith--that's one word, at, c, c, w, dot, com, dot, t, w. [Person1]:  Thank you so much. Does he read his e-mails daily? [Person2]:  Yes. He usually replies immediately. [Person1]:  Great. Thanks again. You've been very helpful. [Person2]:  My pleasure. I hope you get a hold of him.
[Person1]:  this is tough to say, Jordan, but I think we should break up. [Person2]:  are you serious? [Person1]:  yes, I mean it. [Person2]:  but why? Did I do anything wrong? [Person1]:  no, we are just too different. This isn't working. [Person2]:  hey, come on. It's too early to say that. We can fix things. [Person1]:  I have thought about it for a while. I think it's time to move on for both of us. [Person2]:  but I still love you. [Person1]:  I'm sorry. [Person2]:  I knew this would happen some day. . . [Person1]:  then why didn't you talk to me? [Person2]:  well. It's not all my fault, Anna. . . [Person1]:  I don't want to argue with you anymore. This is going to be tough, but Let's try and be friends. [Person2]:  I would like that Anna, but I think I'll need a little space for a bit. [Person1]:  I think we'll be better off if we are apart. [Person2]:  shall we keep Our friendship? [Person1]:  sure, let's just be friends.
[Person1]:  Are you a soccer fan? [Person2]:  Yes, I am. I like to watch soccer games on TV, but I don't play. I watched every game of the 2002 World Cup. [Person1]:  Which team is your favorite? [Person2]:  Italian. They played very well, but they were not very lucky. [Person1]:  I like the Brazilians. They are the real champions.
[Person1]:  My Buddha!! It's beautiful! But I thought you were afraid? [Person2]:  Actually, I was watching your auction all along. I saw you drop out at $ 250. [Person1]:  You sneak! [Person2]:  I watched Buddha buyer go up to $ 315. I waited until the very last minute and then I jumped in at $ 325! I sniped him! [Person1]:  But that's a lot of money! Honey!
[Person1]:  What would you like to order, sir? [Person2]:  I'd like to try some Chinese food. [Person1]:  We serve different styles of Chinese food here. But I'm not sure which one do you prefer. [Person2]:  I have no idea. Could you recommend some to me? [Person1]:  Well. Cantonese food is rather light, Beijing food is heavy, and Sichuan food is usually hot and spicy. [Person2]:  Oh, I see. I'd like to have hot food. [Person1]:  If so, I suggest you have a taste for Sichuan food. Most Sichuan dishes are spicy and hot, but they have different tastes. [Person2]:  Really? So do you have some specialties? [Person1]:  Yes. Roasted Crispy Chicken and Spicy Beef are our specialties. [Person2]:  All right. I'll have them.
[Person1]:  Would you mail a letter for me? My hands are full. [Person2]:  Oh, I am sorry. I'm afraid I can't do it now. I have to meet my supervisor in a few seconds. But I could mail it after that. [Person1]:  That's fine. We're going to drop in and see Jimmy tonight. Don't forget it. [Person2]:  I won't. [Person1]:  Thanks. See you. [Person2]:  Don't mention it. See you.
[Person1]:  Can you ship this batch of cotton within five or six weeks? [Person2]:  What kind of cottons are they? May I see your list? Ah, machine prints. [Person1]:  Yes, mainly prints. There are a few plain as well. Here they are. [Person2]:  I see. And the quantities. [Person1]:  200 rolls of each. Make it 200 rolls for each sample. [Person2]:  How many rolls altogether? [Person1]:  Twenty prints and five plain. That makes 5, 000 rolls in all. [Person2]:  Six weeks, did you say? [Person1]:  Yes, five to six weeks. [Person2]:  We could manage the plain rolls in six weeks. The prints might be put off to eight weeks. [Person1]:  Eight weeks? We can wait that long. [Person2]:  That's the best we can do just now, I'm afraid. [Person1]:  Can't you make it seven weeks for the prints? [Person2]:  What about taking the prints in two shipments? Two thousand rolls in seven weeks, and the remained a week later. [Person1]:  That might be acceptable. I shall have to cable our Beijing office to get their approval. You can definitely supply in the time you've given me, I suppose. [Person2]:  Yes, I'll see that you get those delivery. Shipping by'S. S. American'as usual, is that all right? [Person1]:  That's right. [Person2]:  When can we expect your confirmation of the order? [Person1]:  As soon as I hear from Beijing, that will be either Friday or Saturday. [Person2]:  All right.
[Person1]:  How was your economics class? [Person2]:  Well, to be honest with you, I fell asleep during the lecture. [Person1]:  Was it that boring? [Person2]:  No, it wasn't the teacher's fault. The problem is that I can't stay awake for a two-hour lecture. I have been working in the evening at the hospital. [Person1]:  Isn't that going to affect your grades? [Person2]:  Probably. But I need to work to pay my school fees. [Person1]:  Maybe you should talk to the financial aid office. There's no point in working so hard to make money if you are just going to fail your classes. [Person2]:  But they are going to try to offer me a bunch of loans. I am trying to avoid going into debt. That's why I've been working! [Person1]:  OK, then I have a better idea. Why don't you go to the student employment office and see if they can help you find another job? Even if you have to work, there's no reason why you should work at night. [Person2]:  That's a great idea. I actually have a break before my next class, so I'll go there now.
[Person1]:  Good morning. Can I help you? [Person2]:  I'd like to make a complaint about my holiday in Paris last week. [Person1]:  I'm sorry to hear that. What exactly was the problem? [Person2]:  First of all, the coach taking us to the hotel broke down and we had to wait for over 2 hours in the terrible heat before our replacement arrived. Then when we got to the hotel, we found our room hadn't been cleaned. [Person1]:  Oh, dear. Did you complain to the hotel staff? [Person2]:  Of course, but we were told all the cleaners were off duty. Anyway, that's not all. The people in room above sounded like they were having all night parties every night. I demanded another room but the receptionist told me the hotel was full. [Person1]:  Oh, I see. [Person2]:  And the worst thing was the food in the restaurant was awful. It was so bad we had to eat out all the time despite having paid for meals in the price of our holiday. [Person1]:  I do apologize. I'd like to offer you a 20% discount on the price of one of our autumn breaks as a gesture of good will. [Person2]:  A 20% discount? You must be joking. I want to see the manager.
[Person1]:  Good morning. [Person2]:  Good morning. Er, I'm phoning about the job that was in the paper last night. [Person1]:  Oh, yes. Could you tell me your name? [Person2]:  Oh, Jerry Lynn. [Person1]:  Well, what exactly is it that interests you about the job? [Person2]:  I just thought that it was right up my street, you know. [Person1]:  Really? Could you tell me a little about yourself? [Person2]:  I've been working abroad doing secretarial work. Previous to that I was at university. I've got a degree in English. [Person1]:  Do you have any special skills? [Person2]:  Well, I speak two foreign languages, French and Italian. [Person1]:  Well, I see.
[Person1]:  Hi, Nally, are you hungry?  [Person2]:  I'm starving. Let's go grab a bite.  [Person1]:  Where to?  [Person2]:  How about Karlis?  [Person1]:  Are you kidding? That place is too ritzy for lunch.  [Person2]:  True . ok Let's go to Gerumose?  [Person1]:  Same thing, meals there all coarsen arm and leg.  [Person2]:  I guess it is a little pricy.  [Person1]:  Let's stop it at Multicolor for a quick lunch. .  [Person2]:  That will be Ok. Come on , I can't wait to chow down.  [Person1]:  That was a great lunch , the food was good ,but the service was lousy.  [Person2]:  Is that why you stiffed the waiter?  [Person1]:  You got it . All right, Let's go back to school. 
[Person1]:  Didn't Joe feel it a shame to live on his parents since he has graduated from college?  [Person2]:  He has no sense.  [Person1]:  If I were him, I wouldn't brazen it out by asking my parents for money.  [Person2]:  But Joe won't you. 
[Person1]:  Did you smell something? It smells so great.  [Person2]:  It must come from the bakery on the corner. They are baking cookies. Their cookies are very popular in town.  [Person1]:  How come I never knew that? Do they have a new baker or something?  [Person2]:  I think so. The bakery invited a famous baker from the USA. He is good at making cookies.  [Person1]:  Let's go and get some cookies. I am hungry now.  [Person2]:  Look at the swiss roll over there, they look delicious, too,I am thinking about buying one.  [Person1]:  You can taste some before you buy it. They have food tasting at the counter.  [Person2]:  I am starting loving this bakery now.  [Person1]:  It's one of my favorite bakeries.  [Person2]:  You should have told me earlier. I am a cookie lover. 
[Person1]:  I can't believe you're leaving tomorrow, all the way to Tokyo. Be sure to send us a postcard and write us a letter or 2. [Person2]:  Look, I'm going to be busy. We've got Japanese culture classes in the morning and then field trips in the afternoon. You know it's a really busy program and I will go out with my new friends in the evening. Hey, what are you doing? [Person1]:  Just checking your suitcase, where your travelers checks? Do you remember what they told us at the bank? [Person2]:  Yes, I should carry my checks separately from my ID card. That way even if the checks are stolen, I can order new ones easily. [Person1]:  You know that you should always carry your wallet. [Person2]:  Yes, I know. It's harder for someone to take it if it's in your front pocket. [Person1]:  Well. Only a name on the outside, you should have a name inside too. [Person2]:  OK, I'll write it now. [Person1]:  Oh, it's almost 10
[Person1]:  No, Vince, not next week. Now. You need to guarantee me 5 percent.  [Person2]:  But you just said 4 percent!  [Person1]:  If the next word out of your mouth isn't Yes it's going up to 6 percent.  [Person2]:  Yes! OK, yes. Stop it! You are just ruthless.  [Person1]:  That's why you love me. One other thing. Did you leave me a note this morning on a green post-it?  [Person3]:  I don't think so. Mine are yellow. Why?  [Person2]:  Never mind. I'm looking for somebody who uses green. 
[Person1]:  Hello, Fred. What are you doing? [Person2]:  I'm doing the business online. [Person1]:  Can you tell me the concept of e-commerce? Now, many people mentioned the word, ' e-commerce ', in front of me. [Person2]:  E-commerce, or Electronic Commerce is the practice of purchasing and selling products or services over the Internet. [Person1]:  What kinds of channels can you use in e-commerce? [Person2]:  We can complete a trade by email, electronic data interchange and smart cards, and so on. [Person1]:  What are the benefits of e-commerce? [Person2]:  Firstly, it can overcome the geographic limitation. And secondly, e-commerce can lower the internal costs. And thirdly, people like us, can also open stores on Internet. [Person1]:  How things have changed now!
[Person1]:  I need help using the washer and dryer. [Person2]:  Tell me what the problem is. [Person1]:  I can't figure out how to turn them on. [Person2]:  Do you have some quarters? [Person1]:  I didn't know I needed change. [Person2]:  The washer costs 50 cents and the dryer costs a dollar. [Person1]:  Where do I put the change? [Person2]:  The quarters go into the slot. You have to push the slot in, and the machine will turn on. [Person1]:  Is that everything that I have to do? [Person2]:  That's all there is. [Person1]:  I appreciate you helping me with this. [Person2]:  If you need anything else, just let me know.
[Person1]:  It's my first time to come to Bangkok. Could you recommend some places for me? [Person2]:  Well, it depends on what you have. [Person1]:  What do you mean? [Person2]:  It takes only one day and you could experience almost all the famous spots in the city, I don't think you would like to miss it. [Person1]:  Sounds persuasive. How much will you charge for it? [Person2]:  50 dollars per person. [Person1]:  That's reasonable. Will you take care of meals for the day? [Person2]:  Of course. Please take it easy. [Person1]:  I see. May I know the schedule? [Person2]:  Why not?
[Person1]:  Dai Ling. [Person2]:  Oh, Henry, I haven't seen you for ages. Come in. Let me take your coat. How are you getting along? [Person1]:  Very well, thank you. [Person2]:  Please take a seat.

[Person1]:  What's the problem? [Person2]:  There was a stop sign back there that you didn't stop for. [Person1]:  I really didn't see it. [Person2]:  How'd you miss it? [Person1]:  I only saw bushes at the intersection. [Person2]:  Those bushes are covering the stop sign. [Person1]:  I really didn't mean to run it. [Person2]:  I see why you didn't stop. [Person1]:  Are you still going to write me a ticket? [Person2]:  No, I'm just going to let you go. [Person1]:  Thanks for being so understanding. [Person2]:  That's all right.

[Person1]:  I know I'm a blabbermouth, but what do you think she should do, John?  [Person2]:  Honey, we're in the museum now. We're not here to discuss your coworker's love life. We're here to enjoy the great paintings by Picasso!  [Person1]:  I know! But it's really important to her! Her whole life could be ruined by this man!  [Person2]:  You're making a federal case out of it. One unhealthy love affair can't ruin anything. It could even make your life more interesting.  [Person1]:  Are you serious, John?

[Person2]:  Wonderful, both my uncle and my aunt run Chinese restaurants.

[Person2]:  It sounds tiring. [Person1]:  Yes, but you do get 8 hours of sleep every night. Now, about your diet! First of all, lots of rice and bread, and you could only eat white meat, such as chicken and turkey. Red meat is not allowed. [Person2]:  What? I love fast food.

[Person1]:  Are you a blogger? [Person2]:  Sure I am. I've been writing a blog for almost three years. [Person1]:  Oh, it seems that I'm the only one who never blogs. When did you get started? [Person2]:  I began blogging when I first went to the US for my graduate strides. [Person1]:  What do you usually write about? [Person2]:  At first, I'll write about my life there. Like interesting things on the campus, travel stories, special English words that I come across. Sometimes, I'll post my pictures on my blog so my friends and family can get to know how everything's going. [Person1]:  That's interesting. How often do you write a blog? [Person2]:  It's random. If there happen to be a lot of things going on, I may add several new entries in a week, and if I've got nothing to share, I may leave my blog untouched for weeks. [Person1]:  Got it. Are you still updating your blog? [Person2]:  Sure, since I came back from the US, I've been keeping the habit of blogging, simply to share my personal insights on any topic I like. [Person1]:  Good for you. I know many people just leave their blogs alone after the first few months.

[Person1]:  I have two finals this week and one oral presentation and I'm not ready for any of them! [Person2]:  Sounds like you will be doing some serious cramming till Friday! [Person1]:  I hate this part of school. [Person2]:  Why did you put it off until the last minute? [Person1]:  I didn't mean to. Things just kept taking up all of my time. [Person2]:  Maybe you got your plate too full this semester? You can change that next semester. [Person1]:  I think I'd better. I have twenty four credits this time around. That might be a bit much. [Person2]:  I'll say. The regular eighteen is just about all I can handle myself.
[Person1]:  Television is undoubtedly a great invention, but one of the main criticisms of it is that people just aren't selective enough. Lesley, got a television. how do you pick out the sorts ofprogrammes you want to watch? [Person2]:  I try and look at the programmes that are on to decide which particular ones interest me, rather than you turning it on a seven o'clock and you leaving it on until half-past eleven when the programmes finish. [Person1]:  Do you think of television though as a great time-waster? [Person2]:  Un. . . I think it can be a time-waster and it depends on how particular people are about what they want to see. . . Mm, it can just be a sort total amusement for someone and totally consuming without reallyconsidering what it is they're watching. [Person1]:  Aha, but how do you prevent it coming into your life and taking oversour evenings and at the same time perhaps get. . . get out of thetelevision some of the sort of best things. . . best programmes that. . . that undoubtedly are on television? [Person2]:  Well, I suppose one of the problems is. . . will depend on what a person's life style is, and that if he has other outside interests which are equally important to him as television, he will then, you know, hmm. be more careful about which programme she wants to watch because he has time which he wants to use for other things. [Person1]:  Do you think though that. . . that in. . . in a sense television skilled people's own er. . . sort of, creativity or their ability entertain themselves because if they're bored all they do is justturn on the television? [Person2]:  Yes, I think that is a danger, and I think that. . in fact is what mishappening to a lot of people who use it as their. . . their main. . . um field of amusement and. . . because they don't have other outside interests and even when people come round they'll leave the television and not be, you know, particularly interested in talking to them, you Know the television will be the main thing in the room.
[Person1]:  It's time to leave the office for the night. Firstly I log off my computer, then I set the electronic security system. [Person2]:  That's pretty advanced. [Person1]:  Now I'll quickly send a short message to my wife and take the elevator down to the basement. [Person2]:  Is that where you park? [Person1]:  Yes, the car park is under constant video surveillance, so my car is quite safe. Please get in. [Person2]:  Thank you. Where is your key? [Person1]:  There's no need, I have keyless entry, and the steering wheel recognizes my finger prints before starting the car. Now, we can look at the navigation system to find the best route home. [Person2]:  That's amazing, it even shows all the roads that are congested at the moment. [Person1]:  Using GPS I can rely on this to direct me home. Now I just need to find my E-Card to automatically open the gate and we can drive out. [Person2]:  Pretty soon cars will be driving themselves. [Person1]:  Maybe, but in the meantime why not help me find the remote control for my garage door? [Person2]:  Here it is, and here we are. [Person1]:  When I turn off my home alarm, the house will automatically tum on the lights and set the climate to a comfortable level. [Person2]:  I have to get home, but I don't need all of this fancy technology, I think I'll just walk.

[Person1]:  What did the director say when you told him about our plans? [Person2]:  Well, it wasn't as bad as I expected. I thought he'd just give us a flat out 'No'. [Person1]:  It's OK, then? [Person2]:  Well, maybe. But he put a lot of conditions on what we could do.
[Person1]:  I heard you had got a wonderful job in a post office. How's your new job going? [Person2]:  Not so well, I'm afraid. I just feel like a fish out of water. People there are rather strange to me.
[Person1]:  Hi. Welcome back to Susan's Gardening Show. I'm Susan, and we're ready to take our next caller. We have Mark from Seattle. Are you still there, Mark? [Person2]:  Uh. Yeah, but maybe not for long. [Person1]:  So, how can we help you today? [Person2]:  Okay. Uh, my wife is really into gardening, and about five years ago, she received a beautiful climbing rose bush ... I think an Agatha Christie [That's a nice one.] from her mother who has passed away. Anyway, the rose plant seems to be on its last leg. [Person1]:  Really? Nomally, that rose is really quite hardy [I know.], and it's very disease-resistant, too. [I know.] [Person2]:  Yeah. Well, this situation ISN'T normal. You see about a week ago, I was doing some yard work, and I was using some weed killer [UH-oh.], yeah, to try to get rid of some terrible weeds and ... [Person1]:  Did you spray the roses? [Person2]:  Uh, well, not exactly. I set the spray container down near the roses while I was trimming a bush, and the container must have gotten knocked over, and the weed killer soaked into the ground near the roses. [Person1]:  How much weed killer are you talking about? [Person2]:  Uh, about six or seven quarts (about six liters or 1.6 gallons), I think. [Oh, that's a lot.] You know, I mean when you put ... [Person1]:  And the roses? What do they look like now? [Person2]:  Oh, Dead, real dead. Dead as a doornail dead, but my wife hasn't seen them yet. [Person1]:  Really? What have you done? Blindfolded her? [Person2]:  Well, I've kept her away from that side of the house where the roses are, but she is bound to see them at some point. [Person1]:  Yeah, yeah. You've got a problem. [Person2]:  I mean, is there anything I can do to revive them? [Person1]:  Not unless you're a magician. [Person2]:  Well, can you recommend a quick-growing variety that can take its place? [Person1]:  Marc. I'm sorry. You've made a mistake ... A big mistake. [Person2]:  ... except that my wife warned me this could happen ... Oh, man. [Person1]:  Oh, shoot. Listen. You made a blunder. A big mistake. A really big mistake. But unless your wife goes on vacation for a couple of years, you're not going to be able to replace the roses that fast. [Person2]:  So, any recommendation? I mean, what do I do? [Person1]:  You need to talk to her. [Person2]:  Are you kidding? You don't know my wife. [Person1]:  I'm sorry. Look. You've waited long enough. Don't let the grass grow around your feet. Say something, but be sure to hide the garden shears before you do. Kneel down; ask for forgiveness now. [Person2]:  But that's what I did when I killed her prized apple tree last year. [Person1]:  No way. Really? [Person2]:  Oh, man. Oh! She's coming in from outside [Oh, no, oh no.]. [Person1]:  One final word
[Person1]:  But still, I didn't want this wallpaper. And every time I try to open a program, all I see is a cross-dressing Bush.  [Person2]:  I heard about that horrible virus! It automatically e-mails itself as an attachment to everyone in your address book.  [Person1]:  Well, it's already got on my computer. How do I get rid of it?  [Person3]:  Vote it out in the next election.  [Person1]:  Hey, knock it off-this is serious!  [Person3]:  Have the IT department run a virus disinfection program. Hopefully, the problem will be gone by 2005. 
[Person1]:  Fikky, what's going on? Freggis just told me that you're going to be leaving us. [Person2]:  Yes, I really feel bad out of it. But B. N. D. came up with really good offer.

It has nothing to do with you, Frank. Everybody says you are an excellent manager. [Person1]:  Problems, what problems? Do we have time to talk about it?
[Person1]:  How did you meet your boyfriend, Cindy?  [Person2]:  We were in the same science class last term.  [Person1]:  Who made the first move?  [Person2]:  I did.  [Person1]:  Wow!

[Person1]:  Which season do you like best?  [Person2]:  I prefer spring when little by little everything becomes green and the weather is almost always nice. 
[Person1]:  I heard you are going to London next week. [Person2]:  Yeah, I'm flying there, though I wish there was another way to go. I fly all over the place for business. I'm off and heading out to Paris or New York, but I hate flying. [Person1]:  Why it's much faster than any other kind of transportation? [Person2]:  Well, it always makes me feel nervous and worried [Person1]:  but there are very few plane. Accidents these days. [Person2]:  Well, perhaps not. But when there are there isn't much you can do about it? Is there [Person1]:  Well, I'm sure you'll be all right. [Person2]:  I suppose so, but I still hate it, especially when you get stuck in a seat between 2 other people. [Person1]:  Yes, there isn't much room. But, at least, the journey is over quickly and then you can forget all about it. [Person2]:  Not really. I keep thinking about flight after it's all over.

[Person1]:  Could you hand me my wedge? I'll try. . . [Person2]:  Here you go. I'll wait for you to get on the green before I putt. [Person1]:  No. you go ahead and putt it out. Then I'Il go. [Person2]:  No way, Mary. I'm going to let you go first. I don't want the pressure of putting first.
[Person1]:  What is your most preferred training method? [Person2]:  Well, I prefer active rather than passive training. For example, I like the training offered by a financial software company from which we bought the newest updated virgin. They sent the programmers to demonstrate how to do and then ask us to practice. All employees receiving this training were in the same meeting room, so we could communicate with each other. We had a lot of fun learning together. It helps to build up the work relation among colleagues. [Person1]:  Well, that is also very efficient, right? [Person2]:  Of course, it is much better than just giving us some reading materials or information via the internet. [Person1]:  That's boring. Once we were asked to watch a video on how to operate the punches, all of us seemed to fall into sleep by the end of the video.
[Person1]:  Tonight is a party night! What drinks do you think we need? [Person2]:  Well, not everyone wants to drink beer. Make sure there are some soft drinks and juice. Nothing's as refreshing as iced drinks on a hot day. [Person1]:  I don't think we need too much in the way of soft drinks. Two super bottles of Cola should cover everyone. What about wine? [Person2]:  Just buy a cask of wine. Have you bought ice yet? [Person1]:  No, once I fill the tub with beer, I'll get the ice. The beer will be cool if you put the tub under the ice. The cooler, the better. [Person2]:  I think a bottle of champagne would be a good idea. It's appetizing and tasty. [Person1]:  Well, if you say so. Personally speaking, I'd rather die of thirst than drink champagne.
[Person1]:  Do you have any hats? [Person2]:  Yes, we do. I'll show you several kinds. [Person1]:  I like both of the two hats. Can you give me a discount if I buy both of them [Person2]:  Sure, we'll take 20 % off the price. [Person1]:  I like this colour and it is very bright. [Person2]:  This color is becoming to you, too. [Person1]:  Yes, I think so. How much are they? [Person2]:  The pink one is 30 yuan, and the purple one is 35 yuan.
[Person1]:  Hello, how can I help? [Person2]:  Hello there. I need to buy some foreign currency for a business trip. How much can I exchange? [Person1]:  That does depend on where you plan to travel. If you are planning to travel to Hong Kong or Macao we can exchange up to 1, 000 USD for you. If your destination is elsewhere, we can exchange up to 2, 000 USD. [Person2]:  OK, well, I'm going to Europe. I guess 1, 000 USD will be sufficient for now. [Person1]:  OK, I'll process that for you now.
[Person1]:  OK. Do you want a trim, or do you want to get your hair done? [Person2]:  Can I get my hair done like his? His girlfriend has the same hair, and she's white. [Person1]:  Like that Rastafarian over there? You mean dreadlocks? You crazy! That'll take way too long. [Person2]:  What kind of style are you getting done? Can we match? [Person1]:  I'm gonna get a relaxer, then flip the ends up like Halle. [Person2]:  Can I get a relaxer, too? And why did you say, ' You crazy ' instead of ' You ou're crazy '?
[Person1]:  Oh, hi Dave. Long time, no see! [Person2]:  Hi Maria. I was in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd drop by. [Person1]:  Come on in. [Thanks.] Take a seat. Would you like anything to drink? I have Sprite or orange juice. [Person2]:  Sprite would be fine. Uh, so, how have you been? [Person1]:  Oh, not bad. And you? [Person2]:  Oh, I'm doing okay, but school has been really hectic these days, and I haven't had time to relax. [Person1]:  By the way, what's your major anyway? [Person2]:  Hotel management. [Person1]:  Well, what do you want to do once you graduate? [Person2]:  Uh... I haven't decided for sure, but I think I'd like to work for a hotel or travel agency in this area. How about you? [Person1]:  Well, when I first started college, I wanted to major in French, but I realized I might have a hard time finding a job using the language, so I changed majors to computer science. [Oh]. With the right skills, landing a job in the computer industry shouldn't be as difficult. [Person2]:  So, do you have a part-time job to support yourself through school? [Person1]:  Well, fortunately for me, I received a four-year academic scholarship [Wow] that pays for all of my tuition and books. [Person2]:  Wow. That's great. [Person1]:  Yeah. How about you? Are you working your way through school? [Person2]:  Yeah. I work three times a week at a restaurant near campus. [Person1]:  Oh. What do you do there? [Person2]:  I'm a cook. [Person1]:  How do you like your job? [Person2]:  It's okay. The other workers are friendly, and the pay isn't bad.
[Person1]:  We do a lot of camping in the mountains. What would you recommend for two people? [Person2]:  You'd probably be better off with the four reel drive vehicle. We have several off-road trucks in stock, both new and used.
[Person1]:  Hi, Kate. Can I discuss our class picnic with you? [Person2]:  Sure. Go ahead. [Person1]:  Today I think we must decide where and when to have our class activities of having a picnic. Many classmates are asking me about that. [Person2]:  Ok, first, about the location. How about the Central Park? It is near our campus, and we can just walk there, That saves some time and money. [Person1]:  Sounds good. Do you think we can go on Saturday? [Person2]:  Maybe not. Some classmates must attend the training program of our department. Sunday is better. Ok. Then I will go to inform the class.
[Person1]:  That is a beautiful painting, Jerry! Where did you buy it? [Person2]:  Actually, I made it. I've been taking art classes for the past year. [Person1]:  Really? That's amazing! I had no idea you were so talented. This looks like it was painted by a professional.
[Person1]:  What are you doing here? [Person2]:  I'm preparing my fishing tools. [Person1]:  What for? [Person2]:  I'm going to fish with some of my friends. [Person1]:  Are you fond of fishing? [Person2]:  Yes. I like fishing after school and on Sundays. [Person1]:  When did you get such a hobby? [Person2]:  Long ago. You know, my father is fond of and very good at fishing. When I was a child, he took me to the riverside to see him fishing. I found fishing very interesting then. Well, what's your hobby? [Person1]:  I'm very interested in making home movies. But I haven't got a movie camera. [Person2]:  I also like taking photos and I have a Japanese-made camera. [Person1]:  I take a lot of photos, too. But I'm more interested in the history of film, so I really enjoy using a film camera. I'll buy one of my own someday.
[Person1]:  I am really impressed with your presentation skills.  [Person2]:  Thank you. I have been working on it for several years.  [Person1]:  Well, your time has been well spent!

[Person1]:  . . . so, I said, let's take a break. And since that night, I've been waiting for him to call, but I still haven't heard from him. You don't think he's seeing someone else, do you?  [Person2]:  Come on, don't be so dramatic! I'm sure everything is going to work out just fine.  [Person1]:  You think so? Oh, no! How can he do this to me? I'm sure he's cheating on me! Why else wouldn't he call?  [Person2]:  But, you two are on a break. Theoretically he can do whatever he likes.  [Person1]:  He's the love of my life! I've really messed this up.  [Person2]:  Come on, hon. Pull yourself together. It's going to be alright.  [Person1]:  But I. . . I still love him! And it's all my fault! I can't believe how immature and selfish I was being. I mean, he is a firefighter, it's not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner. I've totally messed this up!  [Person2]:  You know what, Veronica, I think you should make the first step. I'm sure he'll forgive you. . .  [Person1]:  No, this is not gonna happen! I. . . I've ruined everything. . . .  [Person2]:  do you hear something? 
[Person1]:  my mp3 player is broken, so I want to change it for an mp4 player. Can you offer any advice about which brand and model to buy? [Person2]:  an mp4 player? why don't you buy a new cell phone? You can find an mp4 player inside any of the latest cell phones. [Person1]:  Oh, that's a good idea. Perhaps I should have a try. [Person2]:  look at my cell phone. I can listen to music, watch movies, take pictures, play games, surf the web and download documents. It's just like a PAD. [Person1]:  that's cool. I can use the computer and the internet pretty well, but I'm a little bit slow in the latest trends of digital products. [Person2]:  that's Ok. you know, digital devices are becoming smaller and easier to carry, and they won't cost you too much. [Person1]:  yeah, if I buy a cell phone like this, I don't have to take a music player everywhere I go, and I can save the cost of buying an extra mp4. [Person2]:  that's right. what's the flash memory of your old mp3? [Person1]:  256MB. [Person2]:  then any cell phone can meet your need because they generally have memories of over 512MB.

OK. . . Anyway. I will treat you as my best friend. I hope you can do the same. [Person2]:  Leave me! Go away!

[Person2]:  It wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now. [Person1]:  It would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather. [Person2]:  Any rain right now would be pointless. [Person1]:  That's right, it really would be. [Person2]:  I want it to cool down some. [Person1]:  I know what you mean, I can't wait until it's winter. [Person2]:  Winter is great.

[Person1]:  Hello? [Person2]:  Hi, is Heather there please? [Person1]:  Sorry, I think you have the wrong number. [Person2]:  Is this 617-228-2289? [Person1]:  Yes. Who are you looking for again? [Person2]:  Heather Johnson. [Person1]:  Oh, I thought you said Laura. Sorry about that. This is the right number, but Heather's not here right now. [Person2]:  Do you know where she went? [Person1]:  She went to the store to buy some groceries. Would you like to leave a message? [Person2]:  Yes, would you please tell her Eric Martin called? [Person1]:  Hi Eric, this is her roommate Kathy. I met you a couple months ago at the Christmas party. [Person2]:  Oh, yes. How are you? [Person1]:  Good. Heather will be back in about 20 minutes. I'll tell her you called. [Person2]:  OK. Thanks. [Person1]:  Bye bye.
[Person1]:  Welcome back. Now we'd like to introduce Mr. Dong, Who was an English teacher before coming to Britain. [Person2]:  I'm a language teacher at the Jiaotong University in Shanghai. This university keeps up close relations with some British universities, among which is Oxford University. My university and Oxford have an exchange program. Every year Jiaotong University sends several teachers to Oxford; Oxford sends a few professors to Jiaotong. They go to Jiaotong mostly for a few lectures, staying only a few weeks. The Oxford University supplies Chinese teachers with 810 pounds each month. It is all the money I have to cover all my expenses. Although I do not have much money, I'm still happy that I have the opportunity to study in Britain. Being an English teacher in China, I, of course, do not have to pass the IELTS. [Person1]:  Finally we want to introduce Mr. Yuan, who is financing his studies out of his own pocket. He wants to graduate in Oxford. [Person3]:  Neither the Chinese nor the British government is financially supporting me. My parents paid me the flight from Beijing to London. In Britain I have relatives that came to Dover via Hong Kong about ten years ago. They give me 500 pounds each month. That is of course not enough to survive. So I get a part-time job in a Chinese restaurant and earn about 400 or 500 pounds per month. I also had to pass the IELTS in order to study at a British University. [Person1]:  Thank you, Mr. Yuan. Wang, Zhu, Dong and Yuan, four different people and their different ways of financing their studies in Great Britain. In our next edition of Overseas Students at British Universities we will talk about students from the Far East. Until then. Goodbye.
[Person1]:  Hi! May I help you? [Person2]:  Yes. I'm interested in renting a two-bedroom apartment. [Person1]:  First, what price range are you interested in? [Person2]:  Somewhere between $ 400 - $ 450 a month. [Person1]:  Okay. Do you have a specific location in mind? [Person2]:  Well, I would like to live somewhere near the university. Or at least on a bus line. [Person1]:  Okay. Here are photos of the apartments we have available which you may like. [Person2]:  Thank you. This one on Broadway Avenue looks nice. I would like to see that one. [Person1]:  Sure. Let me get the keys and we will go and look at it. [Person2]:  Great! Thank you.
[Person1]:  How many examinations do you have, Tom? [Person2]:  Three, two this week, and one next Monday. How about you? [Person1]:  Two, both are in this week. Then I have to write two papers. I'd rather have examinations. [Person2]:  What do you mean? [Person1]:  Well, you only recite a lot for examinations. You can work really hard for a couple of days, then that's all. [Person2]:  Yeah, I know. But I like papers better than examinations. Urn, where did I put my I.C. card? [Person1]:  Is it in your desk? [Person2]:  No, where is it? [Person1]:  Did you take it back? [Person2]:  I don't know. Oh, God! I don't know what's wrong with me.
[Person1]:  Have you settled in? [Person2]:  Yes, I feel quite at home now. I haven't got used to the food yet, but I'm enjoying the life on campus. [Person1]:  Good. Now we'd better make sure you enjoy your studies. We offer a very wide range of options on the foundation course, as you know; but you can only take six modules -do you know what you want to do yet? [Person2]:  Yes, more or less, but I'm not sure whether to do biological sciences or German. [Person1]:  Well, that's quite a difference. You want to do computer studies, don't you? [Person2]:  Mmmmm, yeh. [Person1]:  Well, let's see-you elected to do physical sciences, basic electronics, art and design CAD-that computers and design-isn't it? [Person2]:  Computer-aided design actually, 'CAD', but... [Person1]:  Oh, right-anyway, CAD and..., and English. That's quite a range. Don't you want to do maths-or computer programming, for example? Why don't you choose to do art and design? [Person2]:  Well, I'm interested in electronics-in computer-especially in writing computer games. I'd like to produce educational software, educational games, eventually. I've taught myself a lot of programming- I... I don't think I'd benefit much from a foundation level course. [Person1]:  No... no, I see that-go on. [Person2]:  So, er, I want the basics-the physical science and electronics I was hopeless at physics in school and we didn't have electronics-but I was good at maths-I don't think I need that. [Person1]:  And the art and design? [Person2]:  That will be good for my graphics-I need that to produce games-CAD too-I've never done CAD before. [Person1]:  No-right-they've got some powerful packages in the computer graphics and CAD offices-you'll enjoy that. So... that leaves English. It's mostly English lit. I know your English is very good, but did you know you can take English as a foreign language as one of the modules in the foundation year? [Person2]:  No... no, I didn't. That's great - if they've got classes at my level. I don't have any problem speaking-but my writing is terrible. [Person1]:  Oh, I'm sure they have-go and talk to them in the EAP department-oh, and I suggest you join the study-skill classes, too. They will have sessions on report and so on. [Person2]:  Great-I really need some help with my writing, especially spelling. [Person1]:  Well, that would be in the EFL classes-study-skills would help more with how to structure your essays and so on... now, your last module... [Person2]:  Yeh... well... I gave up biology at school to do physical-but I much prefer biology -I'd like to study some more While I can but German is very important in technical subjects, so I want to do that too. [Person1]:  Well, you could do it as an option next year-you do know that? [Person2]:  No, I don't-I mean, I didn't cheek. [Person1]:  Yes... yes, I think that's the thing to do-concentrate on your English this year you could take Cambridge proficiency-and you'll need LELTS for the first year of the degree -start the German next year. [Person2]:  Right-that sounds good. [Person1]:  Good. Well, if you have any problems academic or otherwise, just come and see me. [Person2]:  OK, thanks. [Person1]:  I am on extension 7549. [Person2]:  7549. [Person1]:  That's it-just leave a message if I'm not in the office-OK, if there is nothing else... [Person2]:  No... no, that's fine, thanks. [Person1]:  Good-bye for now, then. [Person2]:  Bye.
[Person1]:  I hate carrying so much cash with me. [Person2]:  Don't you have a credit card? [Person1]:  I have one but it can only be used in my country. [Person2]:  Why don't you change the cash to traveler's checks? It's much more convenient and safer. When you are abroad, you can cash them. [Person1]:  Well, that's great.
[Person1]:  Well, hi Mr. Brown. How's your apartment working out for you? [Person2]:  Well Mr. Nelson. That's what I would like to talk to you about. (What?) Well, I want to talk to you about that noise! (Oh) You see. Would you mind talking to the tenant in 4B and ask him to keep his music down, especially after 10 [Person1]:  Ohhh. Who me? [Person2]:  Why yes. The music is blaring almost every night, and it should be your job as manager to take care of these things. [Person1]:  Hey, I just collect the rent. Besides, the man living there is the owner's son, and he's a walking refrigerator. (Well ...) Hey, I'll see what I can do. Anything else? [Person2]:  Well, yes. Could you talk to the owners of the property next door about the pungent odor drifting this way. [Person1]:  Well, the area is zoned for agricultural and livestock use, so there's nothing much I can do about that. [Person2]:  Well, what about the .... That, that noise. [Person1]:  What noise? I don't hear anything. [Person2]:  There, there it is again. [Person1]:  What noise? [Person2]:  That noise. [Person1]:  Oh, that noise. I guess the military has resumed its exercises on the artillery range. [Person2]:  You have to be kidding. Can't anything be done about it? [Person1]:  Why certainly. I've protested this activity, and these weekly (Weekly!) activities should cease ... within the next three to five years. [Person2]:  Hey, you never told me about these problems before I signed the rental agreement.
[Person1]:  Would you like to order now?  [Person2]:  This all looks good! I think we know what we want.  [Person1]:  Please let me point out the chef's special, which is blackened catfish.  [Person2]:  I am dieting, so could the chef prepare the food with no extra sauce?  [Person1]:  We are always happy to adjust our cooking to meet your needs.  [Person2]:  Could you tell me if there are any entrees that are vegetarian?  [Person1]:  The cashew broccoli noodles or the cheese and veggie enchiladas would be an excellent choice.  [Person2]:  I am going to go with the grilled shrimp with garlic sauce. I would like the garlic sauce on the side.  [Person1]:  Would you like your salad brought to you with your entre, or would you like it served now?  [Person2]:  You can serve our salads with our dinner. 
[Person1]:  Are you doing the football pools, Brian?  [Person2]:  Yes, I've nearly finished, June. I'm sure we will win something this week.  [Person1]:  You always say that, but we never win anything! What will you do if you win a lot of money?  [Person2]:  If I win a lot of money , I shall buy you a mink coat.  [Person1]:  I don't want a mink coat! I want to see the world.  [Person2]:  All right. If we win a lot of money, we shall travel around the world and we shall stay at the best hotels. Then we will return home and buy a big house in the country. We will have a beautiful  [Person1]:  But if we spend all that money we shall be poor again. What will we do then?  [Person2]:  If we spend all the money, we will try and win the football pools again.  [Person1]:  It's a pleasant dream, but everything depends on if! 
[Person1]:  Help! That man stole my bag! [Person2]:  Don't chase him. It's dangerous because the train is moving and you could fall in front of it. I'll call the police. You should go to tell the man at the ticket counter what happened. The counter is next to the parking lot. [Person1]:  Thanks. Could you drive me home? My car keys were in my bag. [Person2]:  Of course. Was your wallet in your bag too? [Person1]:  No, luckily my wallet is in my pocket. Oh no, I just remembered my camera was in my bag!
[Person1]:  Good morning, miss, and I help you? [Person2]:  Well, I'm looking for something I saw at a friend's house a few days ago. He said he bought it here. It's a golden metal desk lamp, quite fit for my study. [Person1]:  Take a look at some of the model pictures here and see if you can find the right one. [Person2]:  Picture 2 at page 3 seems to be the one I'd like to have. [Person1]:  I'm sorry, we don't have it in stock right now. [Person2]:  Oh, that's too bad, are you going to be getting more? [Person1]:  They are on order, but I should warn you that the price has gone up. The new ones will be $2 more, they were $12.50 last week. Come back next week if you like. We should have them by then. [Person2]:  Ok, I'll be back.
[Person1]:  I have read your resume. What is your last job? [Person2]:  I've worked in the Production Department for two years. [Person1]:  Could you introduce your biggest accomplishments in your last job? [Person2]:  Working with my colleagues, we were able to increase the production efficiency by 5 %. [Person1]:  Great! Could you tell me your educational background? [Person2]:  Yes. I got a bachelor's degree in English from Beijing University. [Person1]:  Why are you willing to work for our company? [Person2]:  I can get more promotion in your company. [Person1]:  OK, that's all. We'll inform you in two days. [Person2]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  Morning. [Person2]:  Hi there Mr. Anderson! How are you on this fine morning? [Person1]:  Fine, thank you. [Person2]:  It sure is cold this morning, isn't it? I barely even get out of bed! [Person1]:  Yeah. It's pretty cold, alright. [Person2]:  Did you catch the news this morning? I heard that there was a fire on Byron Street. [Person1]:  No, I didn't hear about that. [Person2]:  Did you happen to watch the football game last night? The Patriots scored in the last minute! [Person1]:  No, I don't like football. [Person2]:  Oh. . . By the way, I saw you with your daughter at the office Christmas party. She is really beautiful! [Person1]:  She's my wife! Oh, here's my floor! Nice talking to you. Goodbye. [Person2]:  Sir this is the 56th floor! We are on the 70th! [Person1]:  That's okay, I'll take the stairs!
[Person1]:  Welcome to Lincoln Bank. Which service do you require today? [Person2]:  I'm here to ask about a loan. [Person1]:  We have many loans on offer. May I ask what the purpose of the loan is? [Person2]:  I got married not long ago and we are expecting our first child. I'd like to buy a car for the family. [Person1]:  I see. What you need is one of our Petty Consumer Loans. [Person2]:  Could you tell me what the requirements are for that, please? [Person1]:  Certainly. It's quite simple really. Do you hold a resident's permit? [Person2]:  Yes, I do. I was born and bred here. [Person1]:  That's great. We'll also need details of your occupation. [Person2]:  I have all of that with me. I've also banked here for a number of years.
[Person1]:  Dad, where is the Book Building? [Person2]:  I'm looking. Can you still remember what the conductor said? [Person1]:  She said that when we get off the bus, the Book Building is right by the bus stop. [Person2]:  But I don't see it. [Person1]:  Oh, Dad, look at the sign, please! [Person2]:  Oh, my god! We get off at the wrong stop. I'm so sorry, honey. [Person1]:  OK, Dad, it happens. [Person2]:  It's my fault. So what can we do now? Walk? [Person1]:  Come on, I'm too tired! [Person2]:  OK, you promise don't tell your mother about it, we'll take a taxi. [Person1]:  Sure, I promise. [Person2]:  If you keep your promise, I will also let you watch Ultraman this evening.
[Person1]:  What would you like to have in your breakfast, bread, egg or sandwiches? [Person2]:  Bread. [Person1]:  And milk or orange juice? [Person2]:  Orange juice. [Person1]:  What would you like for lunch, pork, mutton or beef? [Person2]:  I think mutton is best. [Person1]:  What kind of drink do you like most, red wine, beer or champagne? [Person2]:  I like champagne. [Person1]:  And among apples, oranges and bananas, which is your favorite? [Person2]:  Banana of course. [Person1]:  Do you always have meals outside or in your house? [Person2]:  I always have meals outside, because I'm not good at cooking.
[Person1]:  That girl looks very attractive, doesn't she? [Person2]:  Do you think so? I don't like girls who look like that. I like girls who are not too slim. If you like her, go and talk to her. [Person1]:  I'd like to, but there's her boyfriend. He's very broad-shouldered. [Person2]:  He's huge! He must go to the gym to have a well-built body like that. [Person1]:  Do you prefer tall girls or short ones? [Person2]:  I don't mind, but I like girls with long hair. [Person1]:  We have different tastes. I like girls with short hair. I like tall girls-probably because I'm so tall myself. [Person2]:  Have you ever dated a girl taller than you? [Person1]:  No, never. I don't think I'Ve ever met a girl taller than me! Have you gained weight recently? [Person2]:  Yes, I have. Perhaps I should go to the gym, like that girl's boyfriend. [Person1]:  I'm getting a bit plump myself. Perhaps I'll go with you.
[Person1]:  Welcome to our International Business Counter. How can I help? [Person2]:  Hello. I'm trying to track down some documents due to arrive any day on our new L / C.

[Person1]:  What's this, I wonder? [Person2]:  I'm not sure. Let me have a look. . . It could be a coffee grinder. [Person1]:  A coffee grinder? [Person2]:  Yes, it must be used for grinding coffee beans. [Person1]:  Oh, that would be very useful.
[Person1]:  May I help you, sir? [Person2]:  I need a hat. Would you show me some? [Person1]:  Certainly, here you are. [Person2]:  I like the black one. May I try it on? [Person1]:  Of course. It fits you perfectly. [Person2]:  Yes, I thinks so. How much is it? [Person1]:  It's forty-five yuan. [Person2]:  Can you make it much cheaper? [Person1]:  Sorry, our prices are set.

[Person1]:  Excuse me, sir. Could you spare a minute? [Person2]:  Uh, yes. [Person1]:  Do you go to work by train every day. [Person2]:  Yes. I commute five days a week by train. [Person1]:  And would you mind telling us what you think of the rail service? [Person2]:  It's really very good. [Person1]:  Why do you say that? [Person2]:  Well, trains are frequent and come on time. [Person1]:  Which train do you catch in the evening? [Person2]:  I usually take the five thirty home. [Person1]:  And can you get a seat? [Person2]:  No, I usually have to stand. [Person1]:  Would you agree that the service is fast? [Person2]:  Yes, it's reasonably fast but it certainly isn't cheap. Fares have gone up 25 present.
[Person1]:  Anything else? [Person2]:  Yes, one last thing. How much holiday time do you give your employees every year? [Person1]:  Our employees receive fifteen days of paid vacation every year. If you don't use the full fifteen days, they carry over to the following year. [Person2]:  How about sick days? [Person1]:  You get five paid sick days. [Person2]:  Any other benefits? [Person1]:  Yes, we have an excellent retirement plan and medical insurance as well. [Person2]:  Great. Thanks so much for your time. [Person1]:  We'll contact you soon, Ted. Thanks for coming in.
[Person1]:  Please sit down. Let's see...you're Mr. Smith. Is that correct? [Person2]:  Yes. John Smith. [Person1]:  And you're interested in this job? [Person2]:  Yes, I am. I'll graduate from college the coming June. My major is Chinese. [Person1]:  I see. Have you ever done any work in this field? [Person2]:  Yes, I used to be a tour guide for Chinese travellers. [Person1]:  Good. Now, how much money do you expect to have for a year? [Person2]:  From what I've read, it seems that a starting pay would be around $12,000 a year. [Person1]:  Here, you would start at $10,500 for the first year...a kind of training period. Then you would go to $15,000. [Person2]:  That sounds fair enough. What do you think are the chances for me to get a job here? [Person1]:  Well, I'm talking to three people today and four tomorrow. We'll be hiring two people. You'll hear from us sometime next month. Good luck! And thanks for coming in today.
[Person1]:  Hi, Cathy, how did you find yesterday's speech competition? [Person2]:  Well, to be honest, it was quite disappointing. [Person1]:  You didn't like the speeches? [Person2]:  Yes, I did. In fact, I enjoyed listening to most of the speeches. But I just couldn't accept the result, you know. [Person1]:  Hmm, you mean the judges? [Person2]:  I mean most of the listeners including me didn't understand why the judges didn't like Samantha. It was such a shock when they announced the winner was Jim. We all thought Samantha's pronunciation was the best. [Person1]:  You're probably right. But don't you think the speech itself is more important? As I see it, Jim's speech was more meaningful. I was deeply moved by the story he told us. [Person2]:  But, in my opinion, we also learned something very important from Samantha's speech. [Person1]:  That's right. Samantha and Jim were indeed very close. I guess it was difficult for the judges. [Person2]:  Well, I wish I could agree with you. But I do think Samantha was the best.
[Person1]:  Do you know how many bones there are in the human body? [Person2]:  About 100 bones. [Person1]:  No, there are actually 206 bones. [Person2]:  How much do they weigh? [Person1]:  They count for up to 20% of the body's weight. If you didn't have any bones in your body, you would look like a balloon without any air in it. Do you know what bones are for? [Person2]:  I think bones give us the ability to stand, walk and run. [Person1]:  Great. Actually, they have 2 important functions. One is to provide a structure that enables humans to stand upright instead of moving along the ground. The other is to protect the inside of the body. So, how can you keep your bones healthy? [Person2]:  By eating certain foods that are good for bones. [Person1]:  Exactly .Foods such as milk, cheese and green vegetables are helpful. Also, you need regular exercise such as dancing, walking and weight lifting. Exercise makes your bones strong. A lack of exercise weakens your muscles and bones.
[Person1]:  Excuse me. I bought the CD here two days ago. It's scratched, and doesn't play properly. [Person2]:  I'm sorry about that, sir. I'll get you another one. [Person1]:  The thing is I've replaced once already. I think it's just a faulty batch. [Person2]:  I see. Maybe I can offer you a credit note. [Person1]:  Well. To be honest, that's not much use to me. I'll leave the country tomorrow. I'd really prefer a refund. [Person2]:  OK, sir. I'll see what I can do.
[Person1]:  Is everything to your satisfaction? [Person2]:  No, the steak was recommended, but it is not very fresh. [Person1]:  Oh, sorry to hear that. This is quite unusual. I will look into the matter. [Person2]:  This is very annoying. [Person1]:  I'm sorry, sir. Do you wish to try something else? That would be on the house, of course. [Person2]:  No, I don't risk it. [Person1]:  How about a delicious dessert then, with our compliment? [Person2]:  I'm not keen on dessert as a habit. They are fattening. [Person1]:  I see, sir. I'm sure everything will be right next time you come.
[Person1]:  Why did you apply for the position? [Person2]:  I learned from your ad.That you will provide on-the-job training for new employees.This is just what I need, because I'm a recent college graduate. I have the necessary knowledge and skills but I lack experience. [Person1]:  What do you hope to become? [Person2]:  I want to prove my true value in the electronic industry, and hopefully in the near future I would be promoted to a higher position. [Person1]:  Well, thank you for coming.We ' ll let you know as soon as possible.
[Person1]:  How was your interview? [Person2]:  Pretty good. The HR manager asked me the usual questions. Then he wondered why I had decided to leave my previous job. [Person1]:  What did you say? [Person2]:  I told him that I hadn ' t got a raise for three years. I also told him that one of my best co-workers quitted her job because she had not been promoted for eight years. [Person1]:  Did he want to know the reasons? [Person2]:  Yes. I told him that my boss made some excuses of the recession. But I thought he had a pattern and a record of promoting men only. [Person1]:  That ' s sex discrimination. When will you get the reply? [Person2]:  In a couple of days, I was told. [Person1]:  Wish you good luck! [Person2]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  I am fed up with Jack. He is so weak in dealing with other people and always eats dirt. [Person2]:  So he is. But, why not try to help him to become stronger? [Person1]:  How do you know that I didn't try? I just couldn't manage it.
[Person1]:  Have you ever made any plan for your future? [Person2]:  Of course I have. I'd like to marry a handsome man and have two children if possible. [Person1]:  Not me. I'd like to be a bachelor forever. [Person2]:  I don't believe you can make it when you meet your Mrs. Right.
[Person1]:  excuse me, is this the way to the Greta Wall? [Person2]:  oh, it is really far from here. You're going in the wrong direction actually. [Person1]:  I must have taken a wrong turn. [Person2]:  it doesn't matter. Go back the way you came. After about five kilometers, you'll see a hotel on the side of the road. It's a big one. You can't miss it. [Person1]:  and then? [Person2]:  take the next right. Drive about one click further, and you'll see the entrance of the highway to the Great Wall. [Person1]:  thanks a lot. [Person2]:  you're welcome. [Person1]:  by the way, how long does it take? [Person2]:  without traffic, it takes about an hour. [Person1]:  I heard the Great Wall closes early in the afternoon. Do you think I can make it before closing? [Person2]:  yes, I think so. It doesn't close until 5 o'clock. You still have plenty of time. [Person1]:  great! Thank you! [Person2]:  my pleasure, and have a good time!
[Person1]:  Have any plans for the weekend, Tom? [Person2]:  Yeah, I'm going for a hike in the southern Rocky Mountains. [Person1]:  Oh, do you go hiking often? [Person2]:  I go as much as I can. I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature. [Person1]:  It would be nice to get out of the city. Do you want some company? [Person2]:  Sure. But, it will be a long hike, 30 miles in three days. Have you been hiking before? [Person1]:  Yeah, I go a lot too. I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike. [Person2]:  Wow! You must have been pretty far away from the city. [Person1]:  Yeah, my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest. [Person2]:  Well, bring him along too. We'll have a great time this weekend. [Person1]:  Thanks, I'll ask him.
[Person1]:  Can you help me? The program is not responding and I don't know what to do. [Person2]:  Look at the icon in the bottom corner of your screen. Is it flashing? [Person1]:  No. It isn't. [Person2]:  OK. Try closing down all the files you're not using at the moment. [Person1]:  But I can't move the cursor at all. My screen is frozen. What should I do? [Person2]:  Have you tried pressing the Escape key? [Person1]:  Yes, but nothing's happened. [Person2]:  OK, you'll need to reboot your machine. Press Control, Alt and Delete at the same time. [Person1]:  I've never done that before. Will I lose all my files? [Person2]:  You might lose the file you were working on, but don't worry, the help desk can restore it. When did you last take a backup?
[Person1]:  hello. How was the marketing meeting? [Person2]:  hi. It was awful. I think I put forward some great ideas, but none of them were accepted. [Person1]:  I'm surprised to hear that. I thought you had some very good suggestions. [Person2]:  so did i. I ran the ideas by a few people before the meeting and their ideas seemed to have the supports of some people. [Person1]:  so what happened in the meeting? [Person2]:  one or two people didn't take to my ideas very well. That was to be expected. The worst thing was that the people who said the idea were good before the meeting didn't support me during the meeting. [Person1]:  I wonder why not. We could always revise the suggestions, to take into account any objections. [Person2]:  that's good advice, but I'm not confident that even revised proposals will be accepted. [Person1]:  may I make a suggestion? [Person2]:  sure. I'm open to any reasonable suggestions. [Person1]:  Is there a chance you could contact the client confidentially and see what they think? If they like your ideas, perhaps they could put them forward as their own proposals. You won't get credit for ide [Person2]:  I'm not sure that's a good idea. [Person1]:  go on. Take a chance. You could just hint at your idea. The client should be smart enough to take a hint.
[Person1]:  What's your products'competitive edge? [Person2]:  You have probably noticed that our products'prices are competitive. Besides. we can provide more superior products than other companies at the same price. [Person1]:  We need your detail explanation. [Person2]:  It means that if you place a big order, we usually allow 15 % for a trade discount. And our products feel more slip, colorful and faddish than others. You can have a look. [Person1]:  It sounds good, and how about its quality? We only look for the best. [Person2]:  We always sell the best. You can believe us at this point. [Person1]:  OK! How long dose it take you to deliver if we order 1000 pieces of silk? [Person2]:  Within 2 weeks once we receive your orders.
[Person1]:  Don't tell me that's your lunch? [Person2]:  No, this is just my appetizer. . . this is my lunch! [Person1]:  A candy bar for an appetizer and a piece of pie for lunch! That's all junk! [Person2]:  This is good food, it has milk, fruit, grains, nuts. . . [Person1]:  Sugar, sugar, preservatives, fats, more sugar, more fat, more preservatives! [Person2]:  At least I enjoy my lunch! What's in your bag? [Person1]:  My wife sent me with rice, vegetables, and some curry chicken. [Person2]:  There's the difference, your wife made it! I have to make my own lunch!
[Person1]:  This is a great jacket, but look at the price! It's too expensive. $ 600! [Person2]:  No, wait. It's pretty reasonable. You're thinking in US dollars not Hong Kong dollars. It's only about 100 US dollars. [Person1]:  You're right.
[Person1]:  Do you like shopping at flea markets? [Person2]:  l love it. There is always something fascinating to discover. [Person1]:  The antiques market here in Paris is very famous. It's called Le marche aux puces de Saint-Ouen. [Person2]:  That's not very easy to say. [Person1]:  It's also known as Les Puces, which means ' The Fleas'. [Person2]:  Can you find many bargains there? [Person1]:  Well, it really depends. Because you are a tourist, it might be harder for you to get really good prices.
[Person1]:  Hi, Is that David?  [Person2]:  Hi, Jenny. It's David here.  [Person1]:  Hey, what's new?  [Person2]:  Not much. My girlfriend just dumped me.  [Person1]:  Sorry to hear that. What happened?  [Person2]:  Well, she told me things just weren't working out and we weren't right together. But I thought things were just great. Why did she say this? It's completely out of the blue.  [Person1]:  Hey, that's not the girl with pink hair, is it? The girl I saw with Jack yesterday.  [Person2]:  What? She was cheating on me with that ugly guy. Oh, no, I feel like such a loser.  [Person1]:  Hey, she is not worth it. Forget her.  [Person2]:  But she lied to me.  [Person1]:  Hey, she is not worth it. Anyway, there are plenty more fish in the sea. Listen, let's go for a drink in the town. How about that?  [Person2]:  Ok, then.  [Person1]:  But you have to promise me that you are not gonna wear that face.  [Person2]:  What face?  [Person1]:  The one where you look like your dog just died. You have to get over her and the sooner the better.  [Person2]:  Yeah, I know. You are right. 
[Person1]:  Are you ready for your trip? [Person2]:  Not really. I still have to buy some clothes. [Person1]:  Well, what's the weather like where you are going? [Person2]:  It's really hot in the summer, so I'm going to buy some shorts and a few T-shirts. [Person1]:  What about the rest of the year? [Person2]:  People say that the Falcon still be warm until November. I'm going to buy some jeans and a few casual shirts. [Person1]:  Will you need any warm clothes for the winter? [Person2]:  Well, the weather doesn't get too cold, but it often snows in the mountains. So I'm going to buy a couple of warm sweaters, a jacket and a hat. I don't have room in my suitcase to pack a coat. So I'm going to wait until I get there and buy it when I really need it. [Person1]:  Are you going to take anything else? [Person2]:  They say it rains cats and dogs in the spring, but again I'll probably just wait and pick up a raincoat later on. I'm going to take a good pair of shoes, because I plan on walking to and from school every day.
[Person1]:  What do you reading, Linda? [Person2]:  I'm reading a novel, The Mill on the Floss, written by the one of my favorite famous novelists, Gorge Alias. [Person1]:  What's it about? [Person2]:  It's meanly about relationship between a brother and a sister, who live in the mill on the river floss. It describe there are childhood and disputes cause them to separate, the book ends with them ha [Person1]:  Is it difficult to understand? [Person2]:  Not really, i would consider it easy. [Person1]:  Besides novels, any other types literary works that you indulgence. [Person2]:  I really like short stories. [Person1]:  Have you read anything else besides literature? [Person2]:  Certainly I have. I like to read books on vary subjects, and i can read everything I can get my hands on in my spare time. I don't want to idle away and waste my time. [Person1]:  I agree. People who don't read are no better often people who can't read. I also agree that books are like food for the mind.
[Person1]:  Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend? [Person2]:  Sorry, I thought you knew. [Person1]:  But you should have told me you were in love with her. [Person2]:  Didn't I? [Person1]:  You know you didn't. [Person2]:  Well, I'm telling you now. [Person1]:  Yes, but you might have told me before. [Person2]:  I didn't think you'd be interested. [Person1]:  You can't be serious. How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her? [Person2]:  Sorry, I didn't think it mattered. [Person1]:  Oh, you men! You're all the same.
[Person1]:  Hey, Blake! Are you still listening to Mozart? [Person2]:  Yes. Do you like it? [Person1]:  It's great. and I ' Ve heard that listening to Mozart can make you more intelligent. [Person2]:  Really? I've never heard that before. I just like it. [Person1]:  Is classical music your favorite? [Person2]:  Yes. What about you? [Person1]:  I Like pop music best. Classical music is a bit too heavy for me. I can't get fully relaxed in it. [Person2]:  Pop music doesn't have any depth for me. [Person1]:  Yeah, that's why I can enjoy myself in it. [Person2]:  Did you always like pop music. [Person1]:  I think so, since I was in primary school. How long have you been interested in classical music. [Person2]:  I didn't like it at all until I started to learn violin when I was eight. From then on. classical music has been an important part of my life. [Person1]:  oh, I didn't know you can play the violin. Do you still play. [Person2]:  Sometimes, but these days I'm often too busy.
[Person1]:  What can I do for you today? [Person2]:  Can I sign up for some classes today? [Person1]:  Which classes? [Person2]:  I would like to take a driver's course. [Person1]:  Would you like to make an appointment? [Person2]:  Why do I need an appointment? [Person1]:  You need to sign the paperwork. [Person2]:  Can I do that right now? [Person1]:  When can you come in? [Person2]:  How about 9 o'clock tomorrow morning? [Person1]:  I'll schedule you for then. [Person2]:  Thanks for all your help.
[Person1]:  Why do you look so gloomy? What are you looking for? [Person2]:  My dissertation. I put it somewhere last night and I can't find it now. [Person1]:  Did you finish typing yesterday? [Person2]:  Yes, I kept on typing it until midnight, but it is lost. [Person1]:  Don't worry about it. It must be somewhere in your room. Let's see where you put it. Have you searched your drawers and the desk? [Person2]:  Yes, but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk. [Person1]:  How about the shelf? [Person2]:  I've searched everywhere. Where on earth did I put it? [Person1]:  Don't get upset over it. At least you have another week to go. [Person2]:  I have been working on it for a whole month and it's too late to write another. Just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing. How could I do such a thing? [Person1]:  Cheer up! What I meant was that you can find it sometime during a week. There is no need to write a new one. Oh, what's this? Is this your dissertation? [Person2]:  Let me see. Yes, that's it. Where did you find it? [Person1]:  You'Ve put it among these journals. [Person2]:  My poor memory. Thank you very much.
[Person1]:  Hurry up! Mom, I can't wait any more. [Person2]:  Look out, honey. Let's come to the shoal waters. Follow me! [Person1]:  OK, Mom. Can I swim now? I want to learn butterfly stroke. [Person2]:  Honey, listen to me. First, you should learn how to breathe in and breathe out. [Person1]:  Mom, it's so terrible. Water went down into my throat and I almost got drowned. [Person2]:  Do be patient, Honey. Let's do it slowly and correctly. [Person1]:  Oh, Mom, I think I'm not the right person for swimming. [Person2]:  Come on, sweetie, you've done very well. It is the first step that is tough. [Person1]:  Right, I'll make up my mind. Please correct me if any of my movements go wrong. [Person2]:  Yes, well done. That's the way to go. How clever you are! You've got it. [Person1]:  Really? I can't believe it. Everything is possible to a willing heart. [Person2]:  Exactly, next, you should hold your legs together and extend your arms above your head. [Person1]:  Yes, like a dolphin. Am I on the right track? [Person2]:  That's the way to go. Now, you are flying, my boy.
[Person1]:  Tom! How are you? We missed you at the party last night. Are you OK? [Person2]:  I don't know. I didn't really feel like going out. I guess I'm feeling a little homesick. [Person1]:  Come on. We'Ve been through this already! Look, I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here, but we agreed that you were gonna try and deal with it. [Person2]:  I was. It's just that the holidays are coming up and I won't be able to home because I can't afford the airfare. I'm just longing for some of the comforts of home, like my mom's cooking and being around my family. [Person1]:  Yeah, it can get pretty lonely over the holidays. When I first got here, I'd get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home. I almost let it get to me, but then I started going out, keeping myself busy and before I knew it, I was used to to it. [Person2]:  I see what you mean, but I'm still bummed out. [Person1]:  OK. how does this sound, let's get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight. I hear that an awesome DJ is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there! [Person2]:  You know, I could really go for that. You don't mind being my wingman for tonight? [Person1]:  Not at all! It be fun! It will be like a boys'night out. . . well kinda. . . [Person2]:  Great! I must warn you though, whatever happens, don't let me go on a drinking binge. Trust me, it's not a pretty picture!
[Person1]:  It's your turn, sir. I'm sorry that you had to wait. Saturday is a busy day for us. [Person2]:  I suppose so. A haircut, please. [Person1]:  How do you want your hair cut? Any particular way? [Person2]:  I'd just like a trim, and don't cut it too short. [Person1]:  Yes, sir. How about the sideburns? [Person2]:  I think they only need a little trimming. [Person1]:  Can I use the clippers? [Person2]:  No, don't use them, please. [Person1]:  Oh, all right, sir. [Person2]:  Would you trim off a bit more there, above the ear? [Person1]:  Don't you think it needs a little taken off on top, too? [Person2]:  I guess that would be better. [Person1]:  ( Raising a lock ) About like this? [Person2]:  No, not that much. Now, yes, that's fine. [Person1]:  Shave also, s ir? [Person2]:  Yes. [Person1]:  How do you want your moustache trimmed?
[Person1]:  Hi, Deny. Are still working? [Person2]:  Hi, Navy. Come in please. I'm just putting away on my books. [Person1]:  So, you are leaving, aren't you? [Person2]:  yes, I'm going to take a holiday tomorrow. [Person1]:  How nice! I can see you are busying packing. I'm sorry to interrupt you. [Person2]:  That's all right. I'm almost finished. Do you need my help? [Person1]:  Yes, could you please go over this for me? and see if there is any mistake in it? [Person2]:  All right I'll read it soon. [Person1]:  Excuse me for taking your time. [Person2]:  Oh. It's nothing Navy.
[Person1]:  I am starving. [Person2]:  Let's go get something to eat. [Person1]:  Is there somewhere you wanted to go eat at? [Person2]:  We can always go to the cafeteria and eat. [Person1]:  I haven't eaten there before. [Person2]:  The food there is pretty good. [Person1]:  What kind of food do they serve? [Person2]:  You can get whatever you want at the cafeteria. [Person1]:  I have a taste for Chinese food. [Person2]:  They have really good chow mein. [Person1]:  Okay, let's go to the cafeteria. [Person2]:  It'll be fine.
[Person1]:  Good afternoon, doctor. [Person2]:  Good afternoon. What can I do for you? [Person1]:  I'm an athlete for the Olympic Games here. About half an hour ago I fell on the ground and hurt my leg. It bled a lot. [Person2]:  Let me have a look. You're very lucky because the cut is not deep. First, I'll clean up the wound and then dress it. [Person1]:  Must I stop all my training? Will I be able to attend the games? [Person2]:  Take it easy. It's not serious. You should keep the wound very clean. [Person1]:  Don't do strenuous exercises until your wound is healed. [Person2]:  Thank you very much, doctor. [Person1]:  Not at all. You'll be OK soon.
[Person1]:  May I help you? [Person2]:  I don't feel well. I need an airsickness bag. [Person1]:  Yes, madam. There's one in the seat pocket. Here you are. [Person2]:  Thank you. [Person1]:  Should I bring you some water? [Person2]:  Yes, please.
[Person1]:  I want to go to the concert tonight, but it starts at 7, and I have to work until 5. There won't be enough time to go home for dinner. [Person2]:  I've got an idea. I'll pick you up after work and we'll eat downtown. That'll give us plenty of time to get to the concert.
[Person1]:  Why didn't you come to the cinema last night? I waited for you for a long time. [Person2]:  I'm sorry, but I had something more important to do yesterday evening, so I wasn't able to come. [Person1]:  But why not tell me? [Person2]:  I did. I called you many times, but you had your mobile phone power off. [Person1]:  Oh, yes, I am sorry. I remember that I didn't bring it with me because I left it recharging at home. [Person2]:  I'm really sorry to have missed the film as well.
[Person1]:  Hi, Amy. [Person2]:  Hi. [Person1]:  You look great! Have you been on vacation? [Person2]:  Yeah, I have. I was on the West Coast. [Person1]:  Nice! How was it? [Person2]:  Great. I had a wonderful time. It was really nice to get away from work. [Person1]:  Where did you go? [Person2]:  Los Angeles and San Francisco. [Person1]:  How did you like Los Angeles? [Person2]:  Well, it is cleaner than I thought it would be, and there are a lot of trees, so I like it better than I thought I would. But it's huge! It's really hard to get around. The bus service is terrible, and you know, I don't like taking the underground. We had to rent a car. [Person1]:  And was the weather good? [Person2]:  Oh, yes, it was nice and warm in Los Angeles. [Person1]:  What about San Francisco? [Person2]:  The weather? It was cooler than LA, but it wasn't uncomfortable. [Person1]:  Cool in San Francisco? That's surprising. [Person2]:  Yeah, it surprised me a bit, too. And it was a problem because we didn't take any sweaters or anything like that, but it's always like that in August. Anyway, I loved it. It's probably the most beautiful city in the US-all those hills, the bay, and those magical old Victorian houses. [Person1]:  So, you like it better than Los Angeles? [Person2]:  Absolutely! And there's much more that you can see and do on foot! It's smaller than Los Angeles, so it's much easier to get around. There are lots of buses and streetcars, and of course, minibuses, too.
[Person1]:  Hello sir, how can I help you? [Person2]:  Yes, I need this prescription please. [Person1]:  Let's see. Okay, so 50 mg of Prozac, would you prefer this in capsule or tablet? [Person2]:  Capsules are fine. [Person1]:  Okay, you should take 1 capsule 3 times a day. Be sure not to take it on an empty stomach, and also, don't ever mix it with alcohol! [Person2]:  Yes, I know. It's not the first time I'm taking this! Don't worry, I won't overdose! [Person1]:  Okay, anything else I can get you? [Person2]:  Oh, yes, I almost forgot! Can I also get some eye drops and um, some condoms? [Person1]:  Sure. Darn condoms aren't registered in our system. [Person2]:  Oh, well that's okay, I'll get some later, thanks. . . Really it's no problem. [Person1]:  Just hang on there a sec. Can I get a price check on ' Fun Times Ribbed Condoms ' please!
[Person1]:  So, I want a designer wedding dress, roses and lilies at every table. And, let me see, what else? Oh yeah, I want the killers to play at the reception. [Person2]:  So how many people do you want to invite? [Person1]:  Well, 200 should be enough. You will want to invite some people too, I suppose. So, 300 tops. [Person2]:  Where are we going to have this celebration, my dear? [Person1]:  Let's have it at the Conservatory of Flowers. It's such a beautiful building? [Person2]:  Doesn't it cost like $15,000 to rent? [Person1]:  Well, yeah, but it's worth it. [Person2]:  I would be happy with a simple ceremony with our families and close friends.
[Person1]:  Oh, hello, I like the holiday that mentioned Whales, was it whale watching? [Person2]:  Oh yes, it's very popular. [Person1]:  How long does it last? [Person2]:  2 days. We take up to 15 people on this tour, though we usually run it with just 12 or 13. [Person1]:  And when is the next tour going? [Person2]:  Umm, there is one in 3 weeks time on April the eighteenth and then we don't have another one until June the second. [Person1]:  Is there anything else included in the tour? [Person2]:  Oh, there are a lot of things. If you don't want to do the whale watching cruise, your guide will take anyone who is interested. In a Bush walk through the National Park near the hotel. There is no extra charge for that or on a fishing trip, which is an extra $12 I think. There is also a reptile park in town, which costs more or less the same. [Person1]:  Well, I think I prefer Wales to Snakes. [Person2]:  Oh, the hotel has badminton courts, and table tennis tables. But I think you'll be interested in going bowling there. [Person1]:  Bowling? That sounds good. That's my favorite, thanks for the information.
[Person1]:  What languages do you speak? [Person2]:  As you know Japanese is my first language. I also speak English and Chinese. I'm still taking Chinese classes once a week now, how about you? What languages do you speak? [Person1]:  English, German and French, while I was studying in Europe. I used French and German all the time, now I don't speak French very often, but I do keep my German up. [Person2]:  How do you practice your German? [Person1]:  Oh, the man who lives next door, I call him, Hines. He's from Berlin. He and I are always talking in German. [Person2]:  Well, all you need now is a neighbor from Paris.
[Person1]:  Good morning! [Person2]:  Can I speak to Miss Cooper please? [Person1]:  Would you hold on a second, please? Miss Cooper's extension is engaged. [Person2]:  Engaged. Oh, dear! Could you tell her it's a long-distance call? [Person1]:  I'm sorry, sir. I can't interrupt her. I'm sure she won't be very long. [Person2]:  How long do you think she'll be? [Person1]:  I really can't say how long she'll be. [Person2]:  Can I leave a message, please? [Person1]:  Yes, certainly. [Person2]:  Can you tell her I'm waiting to speak to her? [Person1]:  Yes, sir. I'll ring her on an inside line if you like. [Person2]:  Thank you very much.
[Person1]:  Good morning, Mr. Smith. Welcome to Wuhan. [Person2]:  Good morning! [Person1]:  Mr. Smith, did you have a good journey? [Person2]:  I just feel a little tired. You know, it took me 16 hours to get here. [Person1]:  You must take a rest today. [Person2]:  That's very kind of you, but I can do without a rest. I have long wanted to have a talk with you about the possibility of business between us. [Person1]:  We welcome good business. Anyhow, we know you must get tired by the flight, so we arrange a meeting tomorrow. Today you can have a good rest. [Person2]:  Thank you very much. [Person1]:  We hope your stay here a pleasant one! [Person2]:  I believe I will.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, Professor. I think there might be an error in my test score. [Person2]:  Sure. Do you think that the total is wrong or that you got something marked wrong that should have been marked right? [Person1]:  I think that the percentage is incorrect. [Person2]:  Let's just go over all of it to double-check. [Person1]:  Sure, let's do it. [Person2]:  Here is the answer sheet. Do you see a place where I marked something wrong that should have been right? [Person1]:  I don't see any mistakes. [Person2]:  OK, now that we've gotten those straightened out, let's total the score. [Person1]:  Yes, let's total it. [Person2]:  Well, if I total that like this and divide by this number, I get this total. Do you agree? [Person1]:  Yes, you're right. [Person2]:  Well then, we are all straight. Have a good day and thanks for bringing that to my attention.
[Person1]:  I'll participate in a quiz about the 29th Olympic Games in Beijing. It will be held tonight. Will you come? [Person2]:  Sure. What do you know about the Olympic Games on the past? For example, do you know where and when the first Olympic Games were held in the ancient times? [Person1]:  It was held in 776 B. C. at Olympia. It also has a long history of more than 2700 years. [Person2]:  Haven't the Olympics been stopped for a long time? [Person1]:  Yes, there were no games in 1916, 1940 and 1944, because of World War I and World War II. [Person2]:  I see. Look, do you know what that emblem means? I've seen it so many times, but I don't know what it stands for. [Person1]:  Oh, it's the Beijing 2008 Olympics'Emblem. It's a Chinese seal, meaning that Chinese people warmly welcome the friends from all over the world. [Person2]:  I see. I believe there will be lots of foreigners coming to Beijing to watch the Games. [Person1]:  Sure.
[Person1]:  Hi! I see you are having fun with your new computer and internet connection. [Person2]:  There's so much I want to do. I'Ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world. I just ran a search for music to download. [Person1]:  I can give you the name of a few useful website to visit. [Person2]:  Thanks. That would be very helpful. I'Ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want. There's too much information on the net. [Person1]:  When you sent your emails, did you attach any files to them? [Person2]:  Yes, I did. There's an anti-virus programme with my email account that scans all attachments, so I'm sure I haven't sent anything nasty to anyone. [Person1]:  When you use the internet, be careful not to give out your email address very often. If you do, you might get a lot of spam-unwanted email form companies trying to sell you things. [Person2]:  That's good advice. I should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself, such as my password and credit car number. [Person1]:  That's right. Another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites. Your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time [Person2]:  How do I do that? [Person1]:  Take this web page for example. Press the keys control and d together. Click on favourites at the top of the screen. There you are. It has been added to you favourites list. If you click it, you will [Person2]:  That's useful to know. Thanks. I'll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee.
[Person1]:  Why is there never a bus when you want one? [Person2]:  Good question. There aren't enough buses on this route. [Person1]:  Sometimes I feel like writing a letter to the paper. [Person2]:  Good idea. You should say that we need more subway lines, too. [Person1]:  Yeah. There should be more public transportation in general. [Person2]:  And fewer cars! There's too much traffic. [Person1]:  Say, is that our bus coming? [Person2]:  Yes, it is. But look. It's full! [Person1]:  Oh, no! Let's go and get a cup of coffee. We can talk about this letter I'm going to write.
[Person1]:  Hello,George! Haven't seen you for some time. Where have you been?  [Person2]:  I've been away in Paris for the last two month. Glad to see you again.How are you doing?  [Person1]:  Very well.Thank you. Did you have a good time there?  [Person2]:  Yes, I had a wonderful time. 
[Person1]:  How good are you at sports, Bill?  [Person2]:  Are you kidding? I'm terrible! But I love to watch sports. I go to football or baseball games a lot. And I read sports magazines every week.  [Person1]:  Wow!  [Person2]:  Do you like sports, Janice?  [Person1]:  Oh, yes. I like to exercise. But I don't watch sports or buy sports magazines. I don't have much time to do those things.  [Person2]:  Oh, I see. You know, we spend time doing different sports. How much time do you spend exercising?  [Person1]:  Well, I guess I exercise about two hours a day. I do aerobics three times a week, and the other days I play badminton1 with my husband. I always feel good afterward.  [Person2]:  That's great! I've heard people say that before.  [Person1]:  Well, why don't you try to get some exercise? It's difficult, but very rewarding.  [Person2]:  Oh, I'm too lazy to play sports, and I'm not good at anything either. It hardly excites me.

[Person1]:  Hey Lydia, what are you reading? [Person2]:  I'm looking at my horoscope for this month! My outlook is very positive. It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic, and that I will have a passionate summer fling! [Person1]:  What are you talking about? Let me see that. . . What are horoscopes? [Person2]:  It's a prediction of your month, based on your zodiac sign. You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in. I was born on April 15th, so I'm an Aries. When were you born? [Person1]:  January 5th. [Person2]:  Let's see. . . you're a Capricorn. It says that you will be feeling stress at work, but you could see new, exciting developments in your love life. Looks like we'll both have interesting summers! [Person1]:  That's bogus. I don't feel any stress at work, and my love life is practically nonexistent. This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense. [Person2]:  No, it's not, your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality. See? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize. [Person1]:  Well, you certainly match those criteria, but they're so broad they could apply to anyone. What does it say about me? [Person2]:  A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical. She likes to do things in conventional ways. That sounds just like you!

[Person2]:  This one is the same size and color. But the design is different.

Did you know that we recently have a special offer which allows non-members to use our facilities without having to pay the membership fee? [Person2]:  Oh, that's great. [Person1]:  Yeah, but the offer is just until the end of this month. Anyway, let me tell you a little about the facilities at Spa Heaven, and you can decide what interests you. First, we have a fitness center where you can have a weight training so that you can lose some weight. [Person2]:  And that sounds good, but I'm not really interested in getting fit. I just want to get rid of my tiredness and be energetic. [Person1]:  In that case, you may be interested in our sports facilities... [Person2]:  Mm, well, I like to go swimming and I find that helps me relax. Do you have any swimming facilities at your place? [Person1]:  Certainly. We have two 25-meter pools here.

[Person2]:  Now who told you that? [Person1]:  Our new neighbor Mr. Smith. [Person2]:  Mr. Smith? When did he come to our home? [Person1]:  I had to go to his home and ask for help today. [Person2]:  What was wrong? [Person1]:  When I turned on the washing machine, all the lights went out. [Person2]:  Well, did he take care of it for you? [Person1]:  Yes, but he said it would take a lot more work to do a really good job. [Person2]:  What does he mean by a really good job? [Person1]:  He said we need new electric wires throughout the house and a lot of other things. [Person2]:  Did he tell you how much it would cost? [Person1]:  Yes, about a thousand dollars. [Person2]:  A thousand dollars? That's a lot of money. And just when we need to get some work done on our car, too.
[Person1]:  I may go grocery shopping later.  [Person2]:  We need to get food?  [Person1]:  I don't think we have any food.  [Person2]:  What are you going to buy?  [Person1]:  What food are we out of?  [Person2]:  Go and look in the kitchen.  [Person1]:  Could you look for me?  [Person2]:  You should just get the basics.  [Person1]:  What would that be?

[Person1]:  Yes, please. I will stay there for two nights. [Person2]:  Yes, sir.
[Person1]:  I don't understand how the inventor earns money from the invention. After all, anyone can copy and sell it. Really, what is a patent? A piece of paper? A philosophy? You can't see it. [Person2]:  I am glad you asked that. Actually when an inventor has a patent, it's enforceable by the laws in the country where the inventor developed the invention. If anyone makes and sells the product then the inventor can take them to civil court. [Person1]:  What can the inventor expect to receive if he sues and wins? [Person2]:  Well, there are different things the court could do, but there's no guarantee. There's a good chance the court could award him compensation and orders to stop the manufacture and sale of goods. It may well be that the goods would be ordered to be destroyed. [Person1]:  Can the other person being sued do anything to help themselves? [Person2]:  That's the beauty of the whole thing. Ignorance of the law doesn't count, I'm afraid. However, the other person can counter-sue pretending that they were actually the original inventor. [Person1]:  You said the inventor is protected by the laws of the country. Is everything equal? Do all countries have the same law? [Person2]:  No, they're not all equal. You're right. It's only in theory. It is being worked on. The World Trade Organization has developed an agreement, Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, which makes sure that the patent is valid for 20 years. [Person1]:  That doesn't make sense. Twenty years is a long time. [Person2]:  Actually, it does. It's believed that inventors make and sell goods faster after they register the patent because there's a 20-year limitation on the patent. On the other hand, other inventors can use the information the inventor disclosed when the product was registered. Giving the information is all part of the deal. [Person1]:  Cool.
[Person1]:  How are you going all these days?  [Person2]:  Fine, thanks.  [Person1]:  But you look depressed.  [Person2]:  I have some problem with my work.  [Person1]:  Is it serious?  [Person2]:  I can solve it, thanks.  [Person1]:  How about your family?  [Person2]:  Everything is Okay. And as soon as I see my son at home, all my worries vanish into the blue. 
[Person1]:  it's my treat this time. Could we get the bill?  [Person2]:  here you go.  [Person1]:  here's $35 for the meal, and this fruit is for you.  [Person2]:  Oh, Miss Wang, it's usually customary to tip money. [Person1]:  but money's so impersonal. And besides, people don't eat enough fruit nowadays.  [Person2]:  you have a good point. And it's very unique. I really like mango anyway. Thanks a lot. [Person1]:  well, it looks like you've reinvented the tip!
[Person1]:  I'm going to buy a new living room set.  [Person2]:  Where are you going to buy one?  [Person1]:  I'm really not sure.  [Person2]:  You like my living room set, don't you?  [Person1]:  Where did you buy it?  [Person2]:  I found mine at IKEA.  [Person1]:  Are they expensive?  [Person2]:  Everything I got from IKEA cost me a couple thousand.  [Person1]:  Is the furniture crafted well?  [Person2]:  The furniture isn't built cheap.  [Person1]:  I'll pay the money, as long as I'm getting what I pay for.  [Person2]:  You will feel comfortable paying the money. 
[Person1]:  What would you like to order, sir?  [Person2]:  I'd like to try some Chinese food.  [Person1]:  We serve different styles of Chinese food here. But I'm not sure which one do you prefer.  [Person2]:  I have no idea. Could you recommend some to me?  [Person1]:  Well. Cantonese food is rather light, Beijing food is heavy, and Sichuan food is usually hot and spicy.  [Person2]:  Oh, I see. I'd like to have hot food.  [Person1]:  If so, I suggest you have a taste for Sichuan food. Most Sichuan dishes are spicy and hot, but they have different tastes.  [Person2]:  Really? So do you have some specialties?  [Person1]:  Yes. Roasted Crispy Chicken and Spicy Beef are our specialties.  [Person2]:  All right. I'll have them. 
[Person1]:  I bought these trousers here on Wednesday. When I tried them on at home, I found them too small for me. Can I return them and get my money back? [Person2]:  I'm sorry. You can't because you bought them at a sale price. However, you can exchange them for a bigger size. [Person1]:  I have already looked around here, but I can't find the proper size for me. I have to wear them at my co-worker's house warming party this Saturday. [Person2]:  Don't worry. If we don't have a bigger size here. I'll find another store that has the right size for you and you can pick them up by Friday.
[Person1]:  Welcome to the McDonald's. What will it be for you, madam? [Person2]:  One Big Mac and French Fries. [Person1]:  Is there anything else? [Person2]:  Give me one coke, please. [Person1]:  Is this to go or to eat here? [Person2]:  To go, please. [Person1]:  That comes to four dollars and ten cents. [Person2]:  And can I have some ketchup, please? [Person1]:  It's on the service counter over there. Please go to help yourself.
[Person1]:  I need your help, Bob. [Person2]:  What's the matter? [Person1]:  I'm really confused by these annoying abbreviations. [Person2]:  Just relax. That's because you're new to chat. Let me take a look. [Person1]:  A / S / L, IGP, H & K, and ZZZ. What the hell do they mean? [Person2]:  ZZZ means'sleepy or tired or bored', A / S / L is tricky, which is often used at first encounter. It's a three-word question, 'age, / sex / location? ' [Person1]:  Interesting. Then what does H & K refer to? The city of Hong Kong? [Person2]:  Wrong. lt's not a place name, but a passionate act. [Person1]:  Really? What kind? A girl left this word to me, and I thought she was in Hong Kong. [Person2]:  Ahahah. . . you miss her point for sure. H & K actually is an acronym for'hug and kiss'. [Person1]:  Hug and kiss? ! How is it possible? Oh, it's really bad to Miun - Verstand her meaning. [Person2]:  Yeah, seems that you have a lot to learn and memorize.
[Person1]:  How do you think TaiWan's economy is doing? [Person2]:  Not too good actually, people are not spending as much as before! [Person1]:  Do you know why that is? [Person2]:  Lots of reasons I guess, unemployment is pretty high these days.
[Person1]:  Are you feeling better today, Bill?  [Person2]:  Well, it's hard to say. I cough a lot in the evening.  [Person1]:  You'd better give up smoking. It's bad for your health.  [Person2]:  You're right, but you know, it's hard to give up an old habit.  [Person1]:  But you should make up your mind first.  [Person2]:  You know, I often have to work till late at night. I need something to keep me awake.  [Person1]:  Why don't you go to bed and get up early? You'll have the same time for work.  [Person2]:  Thank you for your advice! I'll try it. 
[Person1]:  Hey Michelle. Good to see you. Are you at lunch? [Person2]:  Oh hi Jim. No I just got back. I thought you were on vacation now. [Person1]:  No, I wish I was! I just got back from Spain actually. [Person2]:  Oh wonderful! Have you been there before or was it your first time? [Person1]:  My first time. I've traveled around Europe a lot, but this was my first time to Spain. It was amazing, and the weather was just beautiful! No rain, and just sun, sun, sun. . . [Person2]:  I'm so jealous of you. I've never been anywhere in Europe. I've always dreamed of traveling around and seeing the sights. [Person1]:  Well, I really recommend Spain. You really should go. Anyway, it's been great to catch up, but I must be going, this is my floor. Speak again soon I hope.
[Person1]:  Shall we sing with a karaoke? [Person2]:  Great idea! I do it every so often. [Person1]:  For us, karaoke is becoming a popular entertainment. [Person2]:  Yep. If you are a good singer, your audience will feel comfortable, right? [Person1]:  I can not agree with you more. And if you are an awful one, that will be funny. [Person2]:  I remembered Tom is always out of tune. We burst into laughter. [Person1]:  Is that true? Shall we invite him to join with us? [Person2]:  So tricky!

[Person1]:  What did you do at the office today? [Person2]:  I had a really busy day. I had to work a little overtime. In the morning an important client called to place a large order. I had to check some things with my colleagues before confirming the order. [Person1]:  What kind of things did you need to check? [Person2]:  The most important thing was to check that we had the goods in stock. If the goods are in stock, we can deliver them immediately. I also had to check the price. This customer is very important, so the [Person1]:  I see. Did anything else happen? [Person2]:  I received a lot of emails from potential clients that I had to answer. Each time, I had to check files to see what we had agreed at earlier meetings. Each client has different conditions and required [Person1]:  It must be difficult to remember the details for each individual client. [Person2]:  Yes. That's why we have everything on computer files. We don't use much paper at our office. After lunch, I had to deal with a complaint form a client. [Person1]:  I hate dealing with complaints. Was it a legitimate complaint? [Person2]:  Yes, it was. I managed to sort out the problem, but I was tied up with the matter for over an hour. [Person1]:  You certainly had a busy day. [Person2]:  That's not all! I also had to finish writing a sales report for my boss. In the end, I finished everything. I wonder what will be waiting for me tomorrow morning.

[Person2]:  While the weather doesn't get too cold but it often snows in the mountains. So I'm going to buy a couple of warm sweaters, a jacket and a hat. I don't have room in my suitcase to pack a coat. So I'm going to wait until I get there and buy it when I really need it. [Person1]:  Do you need any clothing for formal occasions? [Person2]:  Well, I guess so, you never know when you might need something for a party or a nice date. So I'll probably take a suit. [Person1]:  Have you forgotten Alice's wedding?

[Person1]:  Have you noticed the Mexican restaurant on the other side of this street? [Person2]:  You mean the one with the yellow bricks? But last time I saw it, it wasn't really in business yet. I saw some people inside furnishing the rooms. Is it open now? [Person1]:  Yes, someone give me a pamphlet introducing the restaurant and its business hours when I passed by this morning. So, let's have a try. My treat. [Person2]:  Great, I like the idea of trying some new food. [Person1]:  Good for you. Today we have more chances to try some new food because there are now many new form restaurants in our city coming from places all over the world. [Person2]:  Also some traditional Chinese food, like noodles and dumpling are marketed in modern ways with improved food quality. I heard this year, the government has imposed very stringent inspection on the hygiene conditions restaurants and suppliers of food are also under tighter control.

[Person2]:  No. Does the newspaper say what has caused that? [Person1]:  Yes. It says the hike was a result of purchase rush in the fourth quarter on expectations of tightening politics.

[Person1]:  I never chatted online before. What's it like. [Person2]:  well, basically it's similar to face-to-face chat, but you type instead of talk. You should try it at least once. [Person1]:  really? Who do you chat with? [Person2]:  to people all over the world! I have a lot of net pals. See, the magic of internet is that it connects people from all over the world. You can chat with someone thousands of miles away as if they were [Person1]:  that's amazing. I will install an online messenger program when I get home. [Person2]:  well, my suggestion for a newbie like you is that don't get lost in the cyberspace. You know internet won't do the filtration for you, so you still need to use your judgement. There are a lot of per [Person1]:  don't worry.
[Person1]:  Isn't this great? I always wanted to own a farm, live out in the country, grow my own food! [Person2]:  This is very beautiful. Though I have to confess, I don't know the first thing about farming! [Person1]:  That's fine! Don't worry about it! [Person2]:  What was that? [Person1]:  Relax, it was just a goat! [Person2]:  And that? [Person1]:  It's just the cows that are grazing over there. We can milk them later. [Person2]:  What was that? [Person1]:  Honey, seriously, It's just a sheep. Relax! [Person2]:  Relax, that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable. [Person1]:  You know what? I don't think I can hack it here out in the countryside. I'm going back to the city!
[Person1]:  Could you introduce some whitening products for me? [Person2]:  Please forgive me just being frankly, madam. You don't need whitening products because you look pretty white. But you have freckles on your face. [Person1]:  Then what kind of product can fade freckles? [Person2]:  I recommend Nisei products. This brand has a face cream which is effective on fading freckles. [Person1]:  How much is it? [Person2]:  419 yuan. [Person1]:  It is too expensive for me. Do you have something cheaper? [Person2]:  I'm afraid there isn't.
[Person1]:  Tell me something about your Valentine's Day. [Person2]:  Ok, on that day, boys usually give roses to the sweet hearts and girls give them chocolate to return. [Person1]:  So romantic. Young people must have lot of fun. [Person2]:  Yeah, that is the holiday is hot, isn't it?
[Person1]:  Whew! It's pretty cold today. [Person2]:  Yeah. My fingers are numb. [Person1]:  So, do you often ski here? [Person2]:  No, this is my first time. Actually, this is my first time skiing ... ever. [Person1]:  So, how do you like it so far? [Person2]:  The snow is great [ Yeah ...], but it's too crowded. You know, two people crashed into me on my first run, and some stupid skier was going way too fast ... drove me into some trees. [ Wow! ] I crashed and lost one of my gloves. [ Oh, man. ] Fortunately, I had an extra pair with me. [Person1]:  Wow. Well, did the woman stop and apologize? [Person2]:  No, it was a man. I'm certain of it. He just ... he just laughed at me. Why do you think it was a woman, anyway? [Person1]:  Uh, well, no reason. I mean, well, you know. [Person2]:  What? You know what? [Person1]:  Uh, uh, nothing. [Person2]:  Yeah. You just wait until I find that guy. [Person1]:  Uh, well, what are you going to do to him, I mean, if you find him? [Person2]:  First, I'm going to break his skis. [ Oh, well ... ] And then, I'm going to take his picture and post it on Facebook. [Person1]:  Uh, don't you think that's a little drastic? Perhaps, it was a simple mistake. And how are you going to identify him anyway? [Person2]:  Oh, that's easy. He was wearing bright red boots and a purple hat ... um, just like yours. Heh, heh, heh ... [Person1]:  Now, now, now. Wait, wait! Yeah. What do you mean? [ Yeah ... ] Wait! Why are you looking at me? You don't think it was me, do you? ... Do you like jazz music?
[Person1]:  May I help you? [Person2]:  Yes, I was trying to log into the patient website, but it seems that I need an email from you. [Person1]:  Did you register when you were in the clinic today? [Person2]:  Register? I don't know what you mean. [Person1]:  Did you give them your email address? [Person2]:  Well, I did four years ago and again 2 years ago. But I never got an email from the doctor's office after that. And I went in today for a check up, but nobody seems to remember me. [Person1]:  Oh, I'm sorry about that. Why don't you give me your email address? I'll help you get everything set up.
[Person1]:  Hi, Bob, do you know anything about boxing? [Person2]:  Yes, it's a sport that does good to bodybuilding. [Person1]:  Oh, I just think it is about fighting. [Person2]:  Actually, it is also a skill to protect ourselves. [Person1]:  Why not come to my boxing club? You will know a lot. [Person2]:  No, but I'd like to see you fight. [Person1]:  Come on, it would be perfect if you experience it yourself.
[Person1]:  There are so many people that the tickets are all sold out! [Person2]:  Luckily we got the last two. [Person1]:  Look, Danny. The Four Great Inventions! [Person2]:  Gunpowder, compass, the paper making, and the printing. [Person1]:  I really admire those who made such great inventions! [Person2]:  May, I don't see why they are great. They are just simple things. [Person1]:  They look simple today. But they were milestones in their times. [Person2]:  Milestones? May, you must be kidding. [Person1]:  Just think Bill Gates, those inventions are as important as the windows system. [Person2]:  Well, I suppose the ancient inventors made a lot of money out of them. [Person1]:  No, quite the contrary. [Person2]:  Why? Didn't you say that they were milestones? [Person1]:  Yes, but they went to the public without any patent protection. [Person2]:  Well, their inventors were not as clever as Bill Gates.
[Person1]:  Over here is our gym. We have all the latest equipment. [Person2]:  But I haven't used exercising equipment before. Can you tell us some more details? [Person1]:  Certainly. We have here the race apparatus, stationary bike, muscle builder set, chest expander, bar bell, dumb bell and so on. [Person2]:  Working in the gym is a very good way for losing weight. What else do you have? [Person1]:  Here's the swimming pool. It's open from 10 a. m. to 11 p. m. There are also massage rooms here. [Person2]:  That's wonderful! I like swimming.
[Person1]:  And what seems to be the trouble Miss Lee? [Person2]:  I have a terrible pain in my stomach. [Person1]:  I see, how long is this pain been occuring? [Person2]:  Since late last night. [Person1]:  I see, let me have a look, shall I? And what did you eat yesterday? [Person2]:  We went to an American seafood restaurant and then we went to eat Chinese food, after that we had a lot of Italian things. [Person1]:  Did you throw up or did you have the runs? [Person2]:  Both. [Person1]:  Well, that could be an upset stomach from over eating. Allergic to any drugs? [Person2]:  No. [Person1]:  Alright, take the medicine every 6 hours and stay in bed today. [Person2]:  Thank you doctor.
[Person1]:  Do you use an anti-virus program to protect your computer? [Person2]:  Yes, I do. I also use an anti-spyware program and a firewall. There are so many nasties on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users. You have to be very c [Person1]:  How often do you run your anti-virus program? [Person2]:  I usually run it every few days. It finds a virus about half the time. [Person1]:  Which anti-virus program would you recommend? [Person2]:  Have you tried this one? It ' s very good and you can download it for free on the internet. You can also download updates for free. [Person1]:  That sounds very good. Which website should I visit to download it? [Person2]:  Just a minute... go to this one. I ' ll send you an email with the line in it. It only takes a few minutes to download. Then you have to go through the set up procedures. But they are not complicated. [Person1]:  What do you use your computer for? [Person2]:  I use it for several things-surfing the net, word processing and creating presentations. I don ' t play many games on my computer, but I do a lot of work with photographs. Using a computer program, you [Person1]:  Computers are great, aren ' t they? I should download some programs and learn how to use them.
[Person1]:  You don't look too well. What's going on? [Person2]:  I just lost my job. I'm just worried about how I'm going to pay the bills. [Person1]:  I'm sorry to hear that. Have you been looking for another job? [Person2]:  I just started, but the job market is very bad right now. I'm not optimistic about it. [Person1]:  That's tough. What does your wife think about this? [Person2]:  She's trying to be supportive, but I can tell she is very worried about our financial situation as well. [Person1]:  I have some friends who might be able to help you find a job. I'll see what they can do. [Person2]:  I really appreciate your help. [Person1]:  No problem. In the meantime, don't try to worry so much. You'll get through this.
[Person1]:  Martha. What's wrong? Why are you crying? [Person2]:  Jake just broke up with me. [Person1]:  I'm sorry. When did this happen? [Person2]:  Yesterday. I didn't even know it was coming. He just told me he found someone else. [Person1]:  What a jerk. He doesn't deserve you. [Person2]:  But it still hurts. I thought I loved him. [Person1]:  He didn't treat you that well either. Maybe you don't want to hear this, but I think you can do better. [Person2]:  Better or worse, it doesn't matter. I had a lot of feelings for him. I really liked him [Person1]:  It must be really painful. I remember when Josh and I broke up. I was crying for a week. [Person2]:  I know. I'll get over him. My first break up was painful because I was naive. [Person1]:  Exactly. You'll find someone again. You should get your mind off of this. Let's go shopping. [Person2]:  Maybe tomorrow. I don't feel like it tonight. [Person1]:  How about coffee down the street? [Person2]:  Sure.
[Person1]:  I just got a letter from an old high school buddy. [Person2]:  Really? That's nice. [Person1]:  He usually keeps me posted. [Person2]:  I've been completely out of touch with my old friends. [Person1]:  It's hard to keep up contact when people move around so much. [Person2]:  Yes, people just seem to drift apart.
[Person1]:  You're free to leave. [Person2]:  I'm so excited. [Person1]:  What are you planning on doing now? [Person2]:  I'm going back to college. [Person1]:  What are you going to major in? [Person2]:  I haven't thought about it yet. [Person1]:  I don't want to see you back here. [Person2]:  You won't see me here again. [Person1]:  I don't think this place is for you. [Person2]:  I know. [Person1]:  I wish you luck. [Person2]:  Thanks. I know things are going to be better.
[Person1]:  Hello. I'd like to get a seat to New York City on a flight leaving sometime before this Friday. [Person2]:  I'm afraid Thera isn't any direct light before Friday. What about a non-direct one? You have to make a change in Detroit. [Person1]:  Well, in that case, that's fine. I want a first class ticket on Thursday. [Person2]:  Would you like to pay in cash or by card? [Person1]:  Cash, please.
[Person1]:  how are you doing? [Person2]:  I'm ok. I wish I could say the same for my friend. [Person1]:  what happened to him? [Person2]:  he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving. [Person1]:  was it his first offence? [Person2]:  unfortunately not. He was charged with a DUI when he was in university. [Person1]:  what happened to him then? [Person2]:  not much ; it was a minor offence back then. He got away with a fine of $ 500. [Person1]:  did they take his license away? [Person2]:  no, they were really easy on him. The problem is that that was a long time ago. They are much tougher on crime now. [Person1]:  what do you think will happen to him? [Person2]:  well, he'll definitely lose his license, pay a fine, and maybe even spend some time in jail. [Person1]:  that doesn't sound too promising. Does he have a defence lawyer? [Person2]:  not yet. If we can't find a lawyer for him, then the state will appoint him with one. [Person1]:  my sister is a lawyer. I can ask her if she can help him. [Person2]:  that'd be great! I know he'd appreciate your help.
[Person1]:  Could you tell me your education background? [Person2]:  Sure. Where shall I begin? [Person1]:  Where did you go to university? [Person2]:  I went to the university of Ohio, in America. [Person1]:  What degree did you get? [Person2]:  I got a bachelor's degree. [Person1]:  What was your major? [Person2]:  I majored in English and minored in Chinese. [Person1]:  What was you G. P. A? [Person2]:  I graduated with honors. I had a 3. 9. [Person1]:  Do you plan to pursue further education? [Person2]:  Yes. I'd like to obtain a master's degree in international relations. [Person1]:  When do you think you will do that? [Person2]:  After I have 3-4 years of work experience. [Person1]:  I see.
[Person1]:  Sit down, please. What's wrong with you? [Person2]:  I feel cold, and I'm shivering. I have a terrible headache and a sore throat. [Person1]:  How long have you been like that? [Person2]:  About a day. [Person1]:  Let me have a look at your throat first. Please open your mouth and say ' ah '. [Person2]:  Ah... [Person1]:  And show me your tongue... Thank you. That'll do. You have slight tonsillitis, and your throat is inflamed. How is your appetite? [Person2]:  Not so good. [Person1]:  Now, let me take your temperature. Please put this thermometer under your armpit and let me feel your pulse? [Person2]:  Your pulse is weak. [Person1]:  Do I have a temperature, doctor? [Person2]:  Yes, you have a high fever. I'd like to give you a blood test.
[Person1]:  Good. Now what kind of job do you want? Mr. Wilson? [Person2]:  I don't mind really. Perhaps a job in a shop or a factory. [Person1]:  Well, I know Brown's Biscuit Factory are looking for a porter. They pay $ 200 a week. [Person2]:  That sounds all right. [Person1]:  Good. Now here's the address of the factory. The manager's name is. . .
[Person1]:  I really want to take a nap. I feel very sleepy today. [Person2]:  What's the matter? Didn't you get enough sleep last night? [Person1]:  I fell asleep very late. It was almost two o'clock in the morning when I finally fell asleep. [Person2]:  Are you worried about something? Why couldn't you sleep? [Person1]:  You know how it is when you're in a strange country. Everything is new, and you get tired and nervous sometimes. Then you worry about your family, about conditions back home, about your courses, about your money, about everything. I tried to fall asleep but I just had too much on my mind. [Person2]:  Well, take it easy. Things will look better tomorrow. Maybe you should try exercising or a hot bath to help you relax. [Person1]:  Anything is worth a try. But right now I really just want to find a quiet place to take a nap.
[Person1]:  Hi, Mary! [Person2]:  Hello, Phil. How are you? [Person1]:  I'm fine. Where are you headed? [Person2]:  Oh, I'm on my way home from work. [Person1]:  I didn't know you had a job. [Person2]:  Yeah. I work part-time at a supermarket. [Person1]:  What do you do there? [Person2]:  I work in the produce section. Wrapping fresh fruit and vegetables. I also stock shelves. Sometimes when it really gets busy, I work at the check-out counter. Have you got a job, Phil? [Person1]:  Yeah. I do yard work for people. You know, cutting grass, pulling weeds, things like that. [Person2]:  I'd like doing that. It must be nice to work outdoors. [Person1]:  Sometimes it is, except when it rains or snows or gets too hot or too cold or... [Person2]:  Ha-ha. I guess every job has its shortcomings. There are times when I get really tired of carrying things around at my job. But a job's a job. Got to earn money for school. [Person1]:  Me, too. Tuition fee is high, isn't it? Well, I'd better get going. I've got to plant some trees for my neighbors this afternoon. [Person2]:  Well. Don't work too hard. Holding down a job, going to class, studying. Sometimes it can become too much for one person. Take it easy. [Person1]:  You, too. It was great seeing you, Mary.
[Person1]:  So, that's what's been keeping you so busy recently! [Person2]:  Yes, I've been tied up with my studies. You know I'm planning to go to the United States this coming summer, but I'm a bit nervous about my English.
[Person1]:  Well, the way you drive, Jen. . . I still don't think that's a good idea.  [Person2]:  I really love this music. It's a compilation.  [Person1]:  I know. It's a mix of all the latest songs.  [Person2]:  And you got them off the Net?  [Person1]:  No. I recorded these from your CDs.  [Person2]:  Well, thanks for asking for my permission. . . Now hand it over and let me record!  [Person1]:  I knew I shouldn't have shown you my new toy. . . 
[Person1]:  Good evening and welcome to Young Writers of the Year. At only 19, this Oxford student has already published a novel. He is a student in physics, but has a special interest in English writing. As you probably know, his novel is based on his childhood experience and is particularly popular among college students. Now, we are very happy to have Simon with us tonight. Simon, welcome to the program. [Person2]:  Thanks. It's a pleasure to be here. I was lucky I suppose. Here I am now with a published novel on my first attempt. [Person1]:  So could you tell us more about your novel? [Person2]:  Well, it's called My Diary and it's kind of an everyday story of my life and schooling in South Africa. You know, my father is a news reporter and I stayed there with him for 3 years. [Person1]:  We learned that while studying at Oxford, you worked as a volunteer in Vietnam during summer vacations. Are you going to make what you are learning from Vietnam, the subject of your next novel? [Person2]:  I can't say at the moment. I'm afraid. I'm very much interested in the history of Vietnam, though. I plan to work there when I graduate. [Person1]:  Well, it sounds exciting and interesting. Thank you for coming, Simon.
[Person1]:  You are an early bird, Tom. What do you do in the morning then? [Person2]:  Exercise. The morning hours are the most precious period within a single day. We should not pass them up easily. Seize the time and do something useful. [Person1]:  So, you choose to spend it on bodybuilding. Where do you exercise? [Person2]:  Usually, I run to the Black Bamboo Park as a warm-up. Admission is free. Then I start my activities. [Person1]:  Do you do the same exercises every day? [Person2]:  No, I've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars, push-ups, sit-ups, bunny-hops, five-kilometer run, and so on. I alternate them over the weekdays. Sometimes, when I find myself in a bad state, I will simply idle about in the park. [Person1]:  Why don't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising? [Person2]:  It's not easy to keep a good habit, you know. I fear that if I fail to get up early one day, I may find it still more difficult to rise early the next. Besides, a mere walk in the early morning is much fun, too. Here and there in the park, you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs, playing er'hu, chess, or just chatting and gossiping. It's interesting to join them. [Person1]:  Oh, yes. Singing is also a good way of keeping fit, at least mentally.
[Person1]:  Susan did you have a dream when you were a little girl? [Person2]:  Of course I did. I dreamed to be a great scientist, but unfortunately I didn't realize it. [Person1]:  I had the same experience with you. When I was a little boy, I dreamed to be a pilot, but now you see, I'm just a common office clerk. [Person2]:  OK. Forget about that Steven. Do you have some practical dreams at present? [Person1]:  I do, and now I'm working hard to learn English and I want to be an interpreter someday. [Person2]:  You are promising. Just follow your dream and never give up. [Person1]:  Thanks. I will.
[Person1]:  Are you still learning Chinese? [Person2]:  Yes, but I don't have enough time for it. I have so many other things to do every day. [Person1]:  It is the same with me. I can read Chinese now but I still find it difficult to speak Chinese and I don't always understand people when they speak Chinese to me. [Person2]:  We don't hear Chinese enough I think. Do you listen to the radio from China? [Person1]:  Yes, I listen to the news from China almost everyday. That helps me understand Chinese but not to speak it. [Person2]:  We'd better go to China for a holiday. [Person1]:  Right. That'll be the best way.
[Person1]:  This broth is wonderful. What's in it? [Person2]:  Lamb and beef. It will get even tastier when we add the veggies! [Person1]:  Hey! Watch out! You're using the same spoon for both broths! [Person2]:  So? [Person1]:  You're getting that hot stuff in my mild broth! [Person2]:  You'll be OK. It's just a little bit...
[Person1]:  Hi, I'm George. I'll be your waiter this evening. Are you ready to order or do you need a few more minutes? [Person2]:  I'm ready now. I'd like the roast chicken and a side order of corn. [Person1]:  And would you like an appetizer before your meal? The soup of the day is our delicious tomato soup. [Person2]:  I'll pass on the soup, but I'd like a garden salad. [Person1]:  Can I get you anything to drink?  [Person2]:  Yes, I'd like a glass of iced tea. [Person1]:  Okay. I'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad. [Person2]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  Do you think they two will get married? [Person2]:  Yeah, you can count on it. [Person1]:  I think so. Yes, they get along so well. [Person2]:  I like him. He's good for her. [Person1]:  You're right. He sure is.
[Person1]:  I am really thirsty. [Person2]:  How about we go and get something to drink? [Person1]:  Let's do that. [Person2]:  Do you know what you want to get? [Person1]:  A soda sounds good. [Person2]:  Soda isn't the best thing to drink when you're thirsty. [Person1]:  Why is that? [Person2]:  Soda isn't good for you. [Person1]:  What should I drink then? [Person2]:  You should really drink water. [Person1]:  That sounds good. [Person2]:  It's a lot better than soda.
[Person1]:  I ' m forming a music band. [Person2]:  Do you already know how to play an instrument? [Person1]:  Uh... Yeah! I ' Ve told you a thousand times that I ' m learning to play the drums. Now that I know how to play well, I would like to form a rock band. [Person2]:  Aside from yourself, who are the other members of the band? [Person1]:  We have a guy who plays guitar, and another who plays bass. Although we still haven ' t found anyone to be our singer. You told me that you had some musical talent, right? [Person2]:  Yes, I ' m a singer. [Person1]:  Perfect. So you can audition this weekend here at my house. [Person2]:  Great! Wait here? You don ' t have enough room for the amplifiers, microphones or even your drums! By the way where do you keep them or practice?
[Person1]:  Can I help you, madam? [Person2]:  Yes. I'd like to choose a sweater for my son. [Person1]:  I see. Do you have any ideas so far? [Person2]:  Not yet. Can you give me some suggestions? [Person1]:  Sure, madam. But may l know how old he is? [Person2]:  Thirteen. [Person1]:  And the height? [Person2]:  About 158cm. He likes to wear loose-fitting sweaters. [Person1]:  I see. How about this one? It's very fashionable and popular among teenagers. [Person2]:  I don't think he'll like it. He prefers simple styles. [Person1]:  How about this one then? [Person2]:  The style is all right, but I'm not sure about the color. Let me think for a while.
[Person1]:  Are you being served, sir? [Person2]:  I'd like to buy a tapestry to decorate my new room. [Person1]:  Artistic tapestry is the highest expression form of the rug weaving art. How about these ones? [Person2]:  These are beautiful! Is this the marvelous landscape in Guiling? [Person1]:  Yes, sir. [Person2]:  How fine the needlework is! What's the price? [Person1]:  Ninety dollars. [Person2]:  It's too expensive. [Person1]:  But considering the fine craftsmanship it is worth much more. [Person2]:  You're right. Would you please show me some embroidery? I also want to buy some embroidered tablecloths to match the tapestry. [Person1]:  Please wait a minute, sir.
[Person1]:  Good evening, sir, and welcome to Chez Attitude. [Person2]:  We have a dinner reservation for four at 7 [Person1]:  Yes, Mr. Foster, if you would please be seated over in the waiting area, our hostess will be with you in a moment. [Person2]:  Thank you. Would it be OK if we have a cocktail while we are waiting? [Person1]:  Of course, I will tell her. [Person2]:  I would really prefer an outside table. Would that be possible? [Person1]:  Sure, if you would like one of those tables, I could seat you right away. [Person2]:  Sure, that would be great! Thank you! [Person1]:  Here are your menus and the wine menu, and would you like to order your drinks now? [Person2]:  Yes, I would like a vodka gimlet, please. [Person1]:  Sure, no problem, sir. [Person2]:  Thank you very much.
[Person1]:  The central Hotel, please. I have to be there by 6 [Person2]:  We shouldn't have any trouble if the traffic isn't too heavy. Is this your first trip here? [Person1]:  Yes. I've never been here before. [Person2]:  You haven't seen the sights yet, have you? [Person1]:  No, I'm open to suggestions. [Person2]:  Why don't you visit the Great Wall first? [Person1]:  That's a good idea. [Person2]:  Here we are. That will be seven yuan and seventy cents. [Person1]:  Thanks a lot. Here's ten yuan. Keep the change.
[Person1]:  I can't figure out what's wrong with my watch. It was just a month ago that I had it repaired. [Person2]:  Don't waste your time and money any more. It's very old watch and it is quite worn out.
[Person1]:  Do you like cooking? [Person2]:  I love it. I really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it. It gives me a real sense of satisfaction. Do you enjoy cooking? [Person1]:  I don't like it. It takes up too much time and I really hate having to clean up after the meal. I can't stand doing the washing up, drying up, and putting all the dishes and cutlery away. [Person2]:  You can ask the guests to help. My guests usually insist on doing the washing up. I just have to remind them where everything goes. [Person1]:  So, what kind of dishes do you usually make? I know you like Italian food. [Person2]:  Italian, Indian, and Chinese. I'Ve only recently started cooking Chinese meals and I need some more practice. [Person1]:  Do you find it hard to get ingredients for Chinese food? [Person2]:  Not at all. You can find most of them at supermarket. The ingredients are usually the same as in western food. The way that the food is prepared is the big difference, not the ingredients. [Person1]:  How long does it take you to cook a meal for five or six people? [Person2]:  Obviously, it depends on what I'm cooking, but I'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours.
[Person1]:  Irene! I heard you were on a date last night! So, how how did it go? I want all the juicy details!  [Person2]:  Um. . . well, actually, we had a fantastic time last night. He was. . . amazing!  [Person1]:  Okay, now you really have to fill me in. What's he like?  [Person2]:  He's really good looking. he's quite tall, around 61, he's in his early thirties, and he's got the most beautiful dark brown eyes. . .  [Person1]:  He sounds hot! What does he do for a living?  [Person2]:  You know what, this is the best part. David is a junior investment banker at Fortune Bank, so he's got a great career path ahead of him!  [Person1]:  Hold on a sec, his name is David?  [Person2]:  Yeah?  [Person1]:  That's my brother! 
[Person1]:  It's Chinese New Year! That means it's time to eat hot pot!  [Person2]:  Let's eat the kind that has both spicy and mild broth in one pot.  [Person1]:  You mean half-and-half?  [Person2]:  Yep. That way I can satisfy my craving for spicy food and you can eat hot pot without burning into flames.  [Person1]:  Good idea. 
[Person1]:  How was your education going on in Australia?  [Person2]:  I'm going to graduate this summer.  [Person1]:  Where are you going to work then, in Australia or back in China?  [Person2]:  I'm planning to return to China after graduation.  [Person1]:  Why are you choosing to leave a foreign country? Many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad.  [Person2]:  Well, I think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment.  [Person1]:  Yeah, China's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country. 
[Person1]:  What's going on here?  [Person2]:  We're waiting in line to get one of Master Li's Chinese couplets. I got one last year and I had good luck all year!  [Person1]:  Master Li? Who's that?  [Person2]:  He's Taipei's most famous calligraphy master! Quick! Get in line!  [Person1]:  I will! I could use some good luck! 
[Person1]:  Gordon, I'm going to Keswick in the Lake District this weekend. [Person2]:  Really? [Person1]:  Yeah, 5 of us. Why don't you join us? We're getting to Keswick on Friday. Then we're going boating on Saturday and on Sunday. We're going to do some shopping. Then I will take some time to visit my aunt Lucy. [Person2]:  You're not going to camp, are you? Isn't it a bit cold? [Person1]:  No, we are not. It is a bit cold. We're staying in a country inn. It's not like 5 star hotels or anything, but it's really comfortable. [Person2]:  Sounds interesting. You know it's the boating that I don't like. [Person1]:  Well, what are you up to? [Person2]:  Sit on my sofa all weekend and watch the DVDs I've just bought. And that will be a busy weekend. I may finish watching friends. [Person1]:  I don't know how you can do that all weekend Gordon. I'd get bored. [Person2]:  I know, I know, but that's really what I want to do.
[Person1]:  Hi, Charles. Did you see the football game on TV last night? [Person2]:  Hi, Laura. I wanted to watch it, but I couldn't. [Person1]:  Oh, that's a pity. It was really exciting. Why couldn't you watch it? [Person2]:  Oh, my wife wanted to see a new play. [Person1]:  So, how was the play? [Person2]:  It was quite good, but we missed the beginning of it because we had to eat first.
[Person1]:  Hi, is this Professor Clark ' s office? [Person2]:  This is Professor Clark speaking. [Person1]:  Hi, this is Kalina from your morning literature class. [Person2]:  Yes, what can I do for you? [Person1]:  I had a skydiving accident over the weekend and won ' t be able to come to school today. [Person2]:  My goodness! Are you OK? [Person1]:  I broke my leg, but it is healing. [Person2]:  How long will you be out of class? [Person1]:  I should be able to return by next Monday. [Person2]:  Fine. Well, thanks for calling and letting me know you will be absent. I hope you feel better soon.
[Person1]:  Good afternoon. I've brought the extra blanket you asked for. [Person2]:  Oh, thank you. [Person1]:  Is there anything I can do for you now? [Person2]:  Yes. I'm rather tired and want to go to bed early. Please make the bed. [Person1]:  Certainly, sir.
[Person1]:  David, I ' m going to China. [Person2]:  Really? How did you get the chance? [Person1]:  You know. I took part in the Chinese contest. I was the best and they gave me this reward. I don ' t have to pay for my trip. [Person2]:  Congratulations. How lucky you are! [Person1]:  Thank you. I ' m leaving tomorrow morning. [Person2]:  I ' m sure you ' ll enjoy the trip. China is such a beautiful country. [Person1]:  I ' m sure I will. [Person2]:  Have a nice journey, Lily. [Person1]:  Thank you, David.
[Person1]:  Hello, Could you please connect me to Mr. Cook's office? It is on Line Three. [Person2]:  I'm afraid you've got the wrong extension number. [Person1]:  Oh. Then I don't know what his number is. Can you check it for me? [Person2]:  OK. Hold on, please. [Person1]:  OK. Thank you. [Person2]:  Mr. Cook is on Line Six. I'll put you through. [Person1]:  Thank you. You helped me a lot. [Person2]:  You are welcome.
[Person1]:  Is it all right for me to come in now. Mr. Sutcliffe? [Person2]:  Well. . . I'm pretty busy. but. . . all right. come in. What can I do for you? [Person1]:  Do you mind if I sit down? [Person2]:  Not at all. Take a seat. Now, what can I do for you? [Person1]:  I want to leave the department. Do you think I could put in for a transfer? [Person2]:  Yes, but why should you want to do that? [Person1]:  Do you mind if I speak frankly? [Person2]:  Not at all. Go ahead. [Person1]:  Well, you see. I don't like the office. I don't like the staff. and I'm afraid you and I don't get on. So may I put in for a transfer? [Person2]:  Yes. I'd delighted if you did.
[Person1]:  What's your ideal boss? [Person2]:  I have had an incredible boss, who was my direct supervisor during the last year of my coop work experience. A-bout two months after I began working for her, she really let me spread my wings. She encouraged me to work independently, because she said she had come to trust my judgment and commitment. So I was able to move forward on projects without having to check in with her every day. Of course, I made certain that she knew what I had accomplished on a daily and weekly basis because I gave her summary reports, although she didn't specifically ask me to. Without her support and encouragement, I don't think I would have felt confident enough to have written up a proposal suggesting that the department change a process that had been in place for a long time. But she was open to suggestions, so long as employees could back them up with research and facts. When I submitted my suggestion, she reviewed it and told me where she thought it needed more work. She then took my revised proposal to her boss. He was a more conservative type, but she lobbied him to try It for several weeks. He did, and it was so successful that it was instituted as a permanent change. I've also worked for some very difficult bosses in summer and part-time jobs. And while I'd certainly prefer to work for one like I've just described, I'm the kind of person who can get along with just about anyone.
[Person1]:  I have a taste for something sweet. [Person2]:  What are you thinking? [Person1]:  I want some kind of dessert. [Person2]:  Well, what kind of dessert do you want? [Person1]:  I was thinking about ordering some kind of pie. [Person2]:  Do you know what kind you want? [Person1]:  I honestly don't know. [Person2]:  Did you want to know my favorite kind of pie? [Person1]:  What's your favorite kind? [Person2]:  My absolutely favorite kind of pie is apple. [Person1]:  That sounds really good to me right now. [Person2]:  I'm happy to help.
[Person1]:  Have you seen Ted Green's new ear? [Person2]:  No. When did you see it? [Person1]:  He gave me a ride to the store yesterday. Oh, I forgot to tell you. Ted and Grace have invited us to their house next Sunday. They took a lot of movies on their trip to China and they want to show them to us. [Person2]:  That will be fun. Let's take the children, too. [Person1]:  No. I have already asked them. They want to stay home and see their favorite actor on TV. They like him a lot.
[Person1]:  Hello, Dan. I was sorry to hear that you had an accident last week. How did it happen and how are you feeling now? [Person2]:  Well, I was riding on my bicycle along the street when a taxi driver suddenly made a sharp turn in front of me. I could not stop my bicycle in time and I was knocked down. Fortunately, I only got a broken arm and a broken leg. The doctor said that I would have to stay in hospital for at least a week. [Person1]:  Do your arm and leg hurt now? [Person2]:  Yes, my leg hurts badly, but I can bear the pain. The only thing that I'm worried about is my classes. You know, next week we're going to have our mid-term exams. [Person1]:  Well, don't worry about the exams. I can help you. [Person2]:  Thank you, but I don't really want to stay here that long. Anyway, thank you for coming to see me.
[Person1]:  What is your favorite coffee? [Person2]:  Irish coffee is my favorite. But I'm not particular on it. [Person1]:  All right. Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home? [Person2]:  Not very often. Making coffee is a bit troublesome. Most of the time, I just buy takeout at Starbucks. And also, I quite like instant coffee. [Person1]:  I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular. Though its taste is not perfect, it's really cheap and convenient. [Person2]:  Exactly. Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee. People love it all over the world. [Person1]:  I agree. I heard that in the western countries, almost everyone likes coffee. Is that true? [Person2]:  Yes. No doubt about that. For us, coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink. I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee. [Person1]:  No, we don't, especially the elder people. But more and more young people fall for coffee nowadays. [Person2]:  I suppose so. That's probably why there are so many wonderful coffee houses in China now.
[Person1]:  Do you want any meat today, Mrs. Bird? [Person2]:  Yes, please. [Person1]:  Do you want beef or lamb? [Person2]:  Beef, please. [Person1]:  This lamb's very good. [Person2]:  I like lamb, but my husband doesn't. [Person1]:  What about some steak? This is a nice piece. [Person2]:  Give me that piece please, and a pond of meet, too. [Person1]:  Do you want a chicken, Mrs. Bird? They're very nice. [Person2]:  No, thank you. My husband likes steak, but he doesn't like chicken. [Person1]:  To tell you the truth Mrs. Bird, I don't like chicken, either!
[Person1]:  I'm glad we took the train. I don't like to ride in buses.  [Person2]:  Yes, I agree. We can see the scenery better. In a bus, all you see are the roads.  [Person1]:  Even in Taiwan, I always liked to take the train. It is more comfortable.  [Person2]:  I agree. Buses bounce too much. After two or three hours, you feel too tired.  [Person1]:  Look at that village!  [Person2]:  Beautiful.  [Person1]:  Do you think I can take a picture through this window?  [Person2]:  I don't know if it will turn out good. The window might cause the picture to be blurry. 
[Person1]:  So, Mark, you've decided to go into education. What made you decide to choose that field? [Person2]:  I guess I just think it's the right choice for me. I used to have a part time job as a tutor and I really liked it. [Person1]:  That's great. There are just a couple of things you should probably consider. First of all, you know you're not likely to get rich by teaching school. Right? [Person2]:  Yeah, I know it's not a very high paying job. Helping people learn is just really satisfying for me.
[Person1]:  I went to Hawaii on vacation. [Person2]:  Do you like it? [Person1]:  I love it! I want to live there. [Person2]:  It must be attractive! [Person1]:  Yes, the island is so green and the water is so blue! [Person2]:  What did you do at night? [Person1]:  At night I went out to eat. The food was delicious. [Person2]:  People who live in Hawaii are lucky.
[Person1]:  You'll never guess my mom and dad have just decided we're going to live in a village. It's so inconvenient there. [Person2]:  Why have they done that? [Person1]:  Dad says it'll cut our living costs because houses aren't so expensive there, but I don't see it. I mean we'll spend more on petrol getting to the city, won't we? [Person2]:  But your mom and dad work at home and you've got your student card for the bus and it's quiet living there. [Person1]:  Buses don't often go to the countryside nowadays, I'll be stuck out there like with no social life. [Person2]:  Well, how about asking your parents for a motorbike to drive to school? That way they don't have to drive you everywhere. [Person1]:  That's perfect.
[Person1]:  Good evening, madam. Can I help you? [Person2]:  Yes. I bought this sheet here yesterday. [Person1]:  Anything wrong with it? [Person2]:  Yes. When I spread it out back home, I found this hole. [Person1]:  Oh, how awful! May I have a look at the invoice? [Person2]:  Here it is. [Person1]:  Well. please accept our sincere apologies, I'll be glad to change it for another one if you wish. [Person2]:  That's very kind of you. Thank you. [Person1]:  We're sorry that this has happened, and I guarantee that the same mistake won't happen again.
[Person1]:  Julia, I apologize to you for what I have done. Please forgive me. [Person2]:  I've already forgiven you. Actually, I also owe you an apology. I was so rude to you that day. [Person1]:  It doesn't matter. I know that people are easy to get mad when they're tired. [Person2]:  Thanks for your understanding. [Person1]:  You're welcome. Happy couples need mutual understanding.
[Person1]:  The whether in Beijing is just beautiful. [Person2]:  Autumn is the best season in Beijing you know? [Person1]:  Yes. I can see. The summer heat is over. And the winter cold is still far away. [Person2]:  What is the weather like in Washington at this time of this year? [Person1]:  Autumn is also very nice In Washington. [Person2]:  Is it very cold in winter there? [Person1]:  No. it isn't. But sometimes it slows a lot in winter. [Person2]:  Does it rain a lot in summer there? [Person1]:  Oh. Yes. Sometimes it rains very heavily [Person2]:  How about here in Beijing? [Person1]:  There's a lot of rain in summer. But it seldom rains in autumn [Person2]:  I feel it's rather dry here [Person1]:  That's true. many people from the south don't like the whether here. [Person2]:  Are you from south? [Person1]:  No. I'm from the north. I was born in Beijing actually. [Person2]:  I see. So this is your hometown?
[Person1]:  Rachel? I'm not sure how you want to handle this account. I think there are a few things to be sorted out. [Person2]:  I agree, Toni. I think the biggest problem we're facing is how to bring it in under budget. [Person1]:  That's true. But even beyond that, there's the question of meeting the deadlines they'Ve set. [Person2]:  Right. Look, why don't we make a list of the problems we're dealing with. It'll be easier to work through them that way.
[Person1]:  I want to meet you. Are you free this evening? [Person2]:  Well, actually, I'm not free today. Do you have anything urgent? [Person1]:  No, I just want to meet you. [Person2]:  How about tomorrow instead. [Person1]:  Hmm, that's all right. Shall we meet at the bar near the beach? [Person2]:  All right. See you then.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, sir. Didn't you see the red light? [Person2]:  Oh, I thought I could make a right turn on red here. [Person1]:  No, sir. The sign says no turn on red. [Person2]:  Oh, I guess I didn't see it. [Person1]:  I'm sorry, sir, but may I see your driver's licence and insurance policy, please? I have to give you a ticket. [Person2]:  Here they are. [Person1]:  Sign here, please. You can appeal to the court within 14 days. This slip has all the information you need. Please drive safely, sir. [Person2]:  Thank you, Ma'am.
[Person1]:  Excuse me? But is there a bus going to the zoo? [Person2]:  Well, you have the right stop. but the bus doesn't go straight to the zoo. You have to transfer to a No. 37 bus. [Person1]:  Where do I change for No. 57 then? [Person2]:  I think you get off at Time Street. [Person1]:  How far is it away from here? [Person2]:  Only 4 stops. Don't worry. I will get off there too. [Person1]:  OK, I will follow you. [Person2]:  Are you a stranger here? [Person1]:  Yes. I came only a few days ago. This is my first visit to this city. [Person2]:  How do you like the city? [Person1]:  Well. it's hard to say. I will see more before I can say anything. But the people I meet here are all kind to me. [Person2]:  I hope you like the city soon.
[Person1]:  Good morning, everybody. Today, for our writing class, we are glad to have Mr. Henry Stone with us, a well-known writer in this country. He is going to share with us his writing experiences. Now, Henry, please tell us how you find so many interesting things for your stories. [Person2]:  OK. I watch people a lot. I do that when I travel. I've been to many countries such as Britain, Italy and Sweden. So I spend a lot of time at airports. While waiting for my flights, I watch people passing by and start my imagination. For example, the other day, when I was waiting for my flight to Greece, I saw a couple. They were buying magazines at that moment. They were not wearing business clothes, but the man was carrying a suitcase. Every few seconds, the woman looked around. I wondered if someone was following them. Perhaps they were running away, and you know, this reminded me of a story in the newspaper that day
[Person1]:  Is it true that you don't do gymnastics at all now? [Person2]:  I'm afraid so. I'm too old. [Person1]:  But you are only twenty-two! [Person2]:  That's too old for a gymnast. If I played in an international championship now, I couldn't win. So I'd rather not do it at all.
[Person1]:  Car trouble center. How may I help you?  [Person2]:  My car won't start! Stupid old car!  [Person1]:  Hold on, before you kick your car let's go through some possible problems.  [Person2]:  Fine.  [Person1]:  OK, first of all, can you turn the key in the ignition?  [Person2]:  Yeah! I am here with my friend and he thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter motor.  [Person1]:  Those are possible problems, but tell me, when you turn the key, do you hear the starter motor crank?  [Person2]:  Yeah, it sounds like it usually does when I start the car, but nothing else happens. The engine won't start. Should I maybe press the accelerator?  [Person1]:  No. If you step on the accelerator pedal you can flood the carburetor and your car will never start.  [Person2]:  So what do you think it is?  [Person1]:  I know this may seem like a silly question, but does your car have gasoline?  [Person2]:  Umm. yeah! Right! I got the car started! Thanks for your help! I told you to fill the tank! 
[Person1]:  Hey daddy! You look great today. I like your tie! By the way, I was wondering can I. . .  [Person2]:  NO!  [Person1]:  I haven't even told you what it is yet!  [Person2]:  Okay, okay, what do you want?  [Person1]:  Do you think I could borrow the car? I'm going to a concert tonight.  [Person2]:  Um. . I don't think so. I need the car tonight to pick up your mother.  [Person1]:  Ugg! I told you about it last week! Smelly Toes is playing, and Eric asked if I would go with him!  [Person2]:  Who's this Eric guy?  [Person1]:  Duh! He's like the hottest and most popular guy at school! Come on, dad! Please!  [Person2]:  No can do. . . sorry.  [Person1]:  Fine then! Would you mind giving me 100 bucks?  [Person2]:  No way!  [Person1]:  That's so unfair! 
[Person1]:  Good afternoon, everyone. The experiment is to start at 3. Have you gone through the instructions?  [Person2]:  Yes, sir.  [Person1]:  Ok, now some points for attention. First of all, pay attention to safety. . . Now, sign your names on the lab record, and after that you can start. If there is any question, just let me know.  [Person2]:  Excuse me, sir. This air compressor doesn't work.  [Person1]:  Have you turned it on?  [Person2]:  Yes, I have.  [Person1]:  Ok, I will get you another one.  [Person2]:  Thank you. 
[Person1]:  Hello. [Person2]:  Hi, I've just been to collect your new basketball shirts from the school. [Person1]:  Yeah, what do they look like? [Person2]:  I don't know if you like them as much as last seasons. You had white ones then remember? And the yellow picture on it made it easy to see you guys on the basketball field, didn't it? But this year. They're just plain. No picture, same color anyway, I can bring them to your house to see what you think. [Person1]:  OK. [Person2]:  But it's a bit late to change them now, I guess.
[Person1]:  So this term, we're doing the book on marketing. Any business in a marketplace is likely to be in competition with other firms offering similar products. [Person2]:  Huh...Excuse me, professor. Could you say that again please? [Person1]:  Having trouble very? [Person2]:  Yes, I'm trying to write down everything you say, but I can't keep up. [Person1]:  You can't write everything down. You need to take notes. Well, just use a pen and a notebook. [Person2]:  But what should I write down? [Person1]:  Is it? Well, writing things down was very useful. It gives you a chance to review them. Now, Mary, just put down the important base. I'll stress these bits in the lecture. [Person2]:  What should I do if I missed something? [Person1]:  Hum... Just leave a blank in your notes and get the information from me later. Does that help? [Person2]:  Perfectly. [Person1]:  Remember to read through your notes after the lecture. [Person2]:  OK. Thank you, professor. [Person1]:  So that's all for today. I had gotten advertising class to go to. We can discuss this further interactivity class.
[Person1]:  Ann, let's go skating. It's not cold today. [Person2]:  I'd like to, but I can't. I must finish my math homework this afternoon. [Person1]:  Isn't the math homework due next Tuesday? [Person2]:  That's true. But I have 2 French classes this Sunday and I'll go to visit my grandmother next Monday. I don't want to do my math homework there. I want to spend time with my grandparents. [Person1]:  Then I'll call Sarah. She loves skating. I really want to have some fun during this long weekend.
[Person1]:  Have you had a chance to look over the contract? [Person2]:  Yes. I've read it carefully. [Person1]:  And do you have any questions? [Person2]:  No. But the contract stipulates that I will teach 22 hours a week. Will you have thatmany classes for me right away? [Person1]:  No, probably not. For the first two weeks you may teach 10 or 15 hours. [Person2]:  But my salary will be 1100 dollars a month. Will you pay me that much for the first month? Because, I mean, I won't be working so many hours. [Person1]:  I understand. That's why I didn't write the date on the contract. For the first two weeks, we will pay you according to the hours you teach. When you have 22 hours of classes, then the contract will take effect. Is that alright with you? [Person2]:  Oh, so I don't sign the contract today. Is that right? [Person1]:  I don't want you to misunderstand, Miss Briggs. We are very serious about hiring you. We want you to teach for us. We usually do contracts this way because it is more convenient. [Person2]:  I can accept that. [Person1]:  Good. And your benefits will begin immediately. [Person2]:  Even my health insurance? [Person1]:  Yes. We will apply for your health insurance tomorrow. And your free membership in the club starts today if you like. [Person2]:  I have a few questions about the free membership. [Person1]:  What would you like to know? [Person2]:  Is my membership the same as paying club members? I mean, can I get discounts at club hotels? [Person1]:  Absolutely. The only difference is in the restaurant and bar vouchers. [Person2]:  What are bar vouchers? [Person1]:  Paying club members get around 300 dollars a year in restaurant vouchers. The vouchers can be used in the restaurant or the lounge. But we don't offer vouchers to employees. [Person2]:  But according to the contract, employees get a discount in the restaurant. [Person1]:  That's right. So in a way, it is cheaper for you than for the members. You get more benefits than they do. [Person2]:  So, for now, you want me to keep a copy of the contract. But we won't sign it yet. That right? [Person1]:  Yes. I've prepared the contract just so that you understand everything. So that you understand the terms. [Person2]:  I understand. And according to the terms on the contract, I am happy to accept this job. I look forward to it. [Person1]:  I'm very pleased. We look forward to having you here, Miss Briggs.
[Person1]:  My aunt told me one of her secrets--cellophane tape. [Person2]:  I just got it at the special health store. It's for my flabby arms. [Person1]:  Let me know how it works. [Person2]:  I have to say, I have had enough of this roller coaster. [Person1]:  I know what you mean. I'm like a yo-yo. [Person2]:  Last week I was down to 60 kilos. This week I had one donut more. Now I'm up to 62 kilos.
[Person1]:  Where is that? [Person2]:  Take me to the airport, please. [Person1]:  Are you in a hurry? [Person2]:  I have to be there before 17 o'clock. [Person1]:  We'll make it except a jam. You know it's rush hour. [Person2]:  There's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time. [Person1]:  I'll do my best. [Person2]:  Here's twenty dollars. [Person1]:  Do you have small bills? [Person2]:  No. If you can't break it, keep the change. But can you give me a receipt? [Person1]:  Here is your receipt. Thank you.
[Person1]:  It ' s nice meeting you. [Person2]:  It ' s nice to meet you, too. [Person1]:  I am happy to be speaking to a presidential candidate. [Person2]:  Would you like to ask me anything? [Person1]:  What do you feel about gay marriage? [Person2]:  I think everyone has the right to love who they want. [Person1]:  Would you legalize gay marriage? [Person2]:  Yes, I would. [Person1]:  Many people won ' t like that. [Person2]:  I ' m sure they won ' t, but that ' s my view on gay marriage. [Person1]:  I really like you. [Person2]:  I really appreciate that.
[Person1]:  Here's the course description guide. [Person2]:  What do I do with it? [Person1]:  Do you want me to help you? [Person2]:  Please. [Person1]:  Look. Here are the core classes. Everyone has to take them. [Person2]:  So I don't have to worry about them. [Person1]:  You're catching on! However, there are elective courses like wood shop, metal shop, home economics... [Person2]:  I'll take home economics. [Person1]:  Good. Now you can pick classes by yourself.
[Person1]:  Good morning, Jason. How did you sleep? [Person2]:  Pretty well, thanks. Still feeling the effects of jet lag a bit, but last night I got at lease six hours of rest. [Person1]:  Great! So, are you ready for a full day of shopping? [Person2]:  Yep. Let's do it. I'm pretty excited! [Person1]:  I know a place that should be perfect. It's called the China Friendship Shopping Center and it's pretty much like an American mall - except with more variety. You can even buy a live chicken there if you want. [Person2]:  Live chicken? Thanks, but no thanks. So. . . tell me about bargaining. How can I do it like a local? [Person1]:  Well. I'll be honest and say you'll never be as good at bargaining as a local person. You're a foreigner and the sellers can see that. But. . . if you're smart, you can get bargains that are not too far away from the local price. [Person2]:  Cool! Teach me! [Person1]:  For starters, you want to do a lot of scouting first. You've got to know what things cost. [Person2]:  Someone told me to go to a convenience store and see how much a soft drink or a tube of toothpaste costs. The idea is that by comparing the prices of those items, you can figure out the relative prices of everything else. [Person1]:  That could be helpful. But when you go into a shopping center. . . prices become very flexible. You have to be able to read the market.
[Person1]:  Are you ready, honey? [Person2]:  Sorry, not yet! can you help me to select the dress? i don, t what i should wear to fit thinner party. [Person1]:  Just dress formal. [Person2]:  How about transom? [Person1]:  It is too loud, we'll handle some official business first before the dinner. [Person2]:  Oh, i nearly forget it. [Person1]:  You can put on your white shoes, it fits every occasion.
[Person1]:  How do you like this waltz? [Person2]:  It's very nice. I like it very much. [Person1]:  Well, then, may I invite you for the first dance? [Person2]:  My pleasure. But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer, and I suppose you dance often. [Person1]:  Me? Oh, no. In fact, I only took up dancing quite recently. [Person2]:  Oh, really? But you're doing the waltz wonderfully well. [Person1]:  I'm glad you say so. You dance beautifully too. It's lucky that I got you as a partner. [Person2]:  Thank you for your compliments. It's just you are a good leader. Do you like the foxtrot and tango? [Person1]:  Yes. And what dances do you like best? [Person2]:  Disco is my favorite. I like it better than any other dances because it can release one's hidden feelings, and is a healthy exercise. But I don't do the rock and roll nor break-dancing. [Person1]:  Oh, well, the music has stopped. Thank you for the dance. [Person2]:  My pleasure.

[Person1]:  Your price is rather high. We cannot accept it. Can you bring the price down a little? [Person2]:  In fact, if it weren't for our good relations, we wouldn't consider making you a firm order at this price. [Person1]:  I can't agree with you. We have quotation from other sources too. Their prices are lower than yours. [Person2]:  But you know our design is superior to any other products from other companies. In fact, there is no room to negotiate the price now.

The same size as I do. [Person1]:  Would she like this style? [Person2]:  No, do you have something different from this one? [Person1]:  What about this one? [Person2]:  The style is fine, but the color is too dark. Do you have something brighter? [Person1]:  How about this one? [Person2]:  It's too expensive. Do you have something cheaper? [Person1]:  Yes, we do. There is a budget department on the first floor. Why don't you check there? [Person2]:  Okay. Thank you very much.
[Person1]:  Anything interesting in the paper today, dear? [Person2]:  Well, yeah. There are a few here that might interest us. Here's one for just four hundred dollars. It only has one bedroom, but it sounds nice, near Lake Street. [Person1]:  Yeah. Let me see what the cheapest two-bedroom apartment is. Oh, here's one on Market Street. It's a real bargain. Only three hundred and fifty dollars. But it doesn't have any furniture. [Person2]:  Well, it costs a lot to buy all the furniture. [Person1]:  Oh, here's another one for just over four hundred dollars. This sounds very interesting! It's on South Street. That's a nice area. [Person2]:  Yes, it's quiet. Did you say two bedrooms? [Person1]:  Yes, at four hundred and fifteen dollars. [Person2]:  Why don't we go and have a look? [Person1]:  Okay, I'll give them a call.
[Person1]:  We all know that poetry is not everyone's cup of tea. But according to Dr. James Stewart. [Person2]:  Hello! [Person1]:  Hello! If you are suffering from anxiety or depression, poetry may be the solution to your problems. Dr. Stewart, how does poetry help? [Person2]:  Em, OK! Look, let me give you an example. A patient came into our clinic last month. He was a middle-aged businessmen, and he was feeling, well, like most middle-aged businessmen, really stressed and with his life out of control. He talked to me about it, and, well, I was convinced that medication just wouldn't help him. Then I read him a poem called Leisure by WHDavis. Do you know the one? It begins, er... [Person1]:  I do, yes. [Person2]:  What is this life, er, so full of. It is so or if... [Person1]:  I think it's if. [Person2]:  If full of care, that's it, yes. We have no time to stand and stare. Well, you know the one. The next time he came to see me, he told me that, well, it was a sort of turning point for him. The poem made him think about the quality of his life and the need to find a balance between his work and his social life. Er, you see, because the idea was expressed poetically, he felt that he could identify with it, and actually feel the message in a way that he wouldn't if he simply discussed it with me. And we just had the usual kind of conversation about it. [Person1]:  Yes, I see. [Person2]:  You see, reading poetry to patients seems to make them calmer. Encouraging them to write it has an even more dramatic effect, actually. Era, there.., there are something about the process of expressing confused thoughts and feelings and emotions in writing that actually helps people or suffering from stress and anxiety. This happens especially if the words are written in a poetical way with a sense of rhythm rather than in prose, you see. Er, now, for a long time, we've been asking patients to write diaries to put their feelings into words. But it turns out that writing poetry seems to work much better for many patients. [Person1]:  Right, and have you found that other doctors and therapists have made the same discoveries? [Person2]:  Yes, many of my colleagues have successfully used poetry with patients suffering from anxiety or depression or even eating disorders. I mean their patients said that, that reading poetry made them feel less stressed. You know, almost as many said that writing it has the same effect. You see, some said that writing poetry reduced the pain they felt when a friend or a close relation had died extraordinarily! [Person1]:  Yes, it certainly is! [Person2]:  Era. Others thought that it enabled them to reduce or stop taking antidepressants or tranquillizers. And writing poetry helps them to provide a sort of outlet for their emotions. [Person1]:  Em, that's fascinating! Can you give any explanation as to why poetry might be calming in this way? [Person2]:  Well, it's only a guess. But I say that the calming effect of poetry is related to an interplay between the left and right hemispheres of the brain, the.., you probably know the left half is the one which analyzes and responds to language while the right one visualizes images and responds to rhythm. Now, I believe that poetry may activate the system at the base of the brain where thoughts meet emotions, you see. [Person1]:  Do you think that people need a doctor to prescribe particular poems for particular conditions? [Person2]:  No, no, no. I think poetry can help everyone to feel calm and less stressed. People who read poetry tend not to be anxious and stressed, probably because they are in touch with their emotions. I mean they certainly don't need a doctor to tell them which poems to read. [Person1]:  Thank you very much, Dr. Stewart. [Person2]:  You are welcome.
[Person1]:  In my country, we go to school from 8 o'clock in the morning until five in the afternoon.  [Person2]:  Five days a week , too?  [Person1]:  Actually, five and a half. On Saturday, we have classes only in the morning.  [Person2]:  Gosh!  [Person1]:  That's too much for us really.  [Person2]:  Where are you going now?  [Person1]:  I'm going to try to find out where the school is located.  [Person2]:  When do you start school?  [Person1]:  I'm going to register right now.  [Person2]:  That's good. 
[Person1]:  do you need a hand?  [Person2]:  no, I can hadle it. Thanks anyway.  [Person1]:  are you sure you don't need any help?  [Person2]:  well, maybe just a little. I can't seem to make it fit.  [Person1]:  I swear, the overhead compartments on these planes just keep getting smaller and smaller!  [Person2]:  that's so true. thanks for your help. Are you in the aisle seat in this row?  [Person1]:  yes. What about you?  [Person2]:  I'm in the middle seat.  [Person1]:  oh, I guess I'll let you through then.  [Person2]:  thanks. sorry for making you get out of your seat again.  [Person1]:  that's alright. I notice you have a few newspapers there. Would you mind lending me one?  [Person2]:  no, not at all. Which one would you like--the New York Times or the Guardian?  [Person1]:  I prefer the British paper, but I'll read whatever one you aren't going to read right away.  [Person2]:  I was just going to do a little Sudoku while we wait for the plane to take off, so the Guardian is all yours.  [Person1]:  thanks a lot. That's really nice of you. Would you like a piece of gum?  [Person2]:  that would be great. thanks. 
[Person1]:  Hi, could we have two orange juice smoothies?  [Person2]:  Would you like those with yogurt?  [Person1]:  Sure, why not?  [Person2]:  What else would you like to add? We highly recommend caterpillar fungus.  [Person1]:  Caterpillar fungus? ! What the heck is that?  [Person2]:  It's a special kind of Chinese herb. It's good for you! 
[Person1]:  Hi, Steve. How was the concert? [Person2]:  Pretty good. The crowd seemed to enjoy it. [Person1]:  And how did Andrew do? Was he nervous? This was his first concert. [Person2]:  He seemed very calm. [Person1]:  Did he make any mistakes? [Person2]:  Well, sure. [Person1]:  Oh, no. Did everyone notice? [Person2]:  I don't think so. They were little mistakes. Someone would need to know the song very well to notice. I heard the mistakes but I don't think anyone else did. He seemed so calm that no one thought anything was wrong. [Person1]:  I'm so glad to hear that. He's been working hard for many years to get this good on the piano. His next concert will be better. [Person2]:  Yes, everyone makes mistakes, but the crowd liked him. They clapped loudly for him when he was done. [Person1]:  We should celebrate tonight. Let's take him to his favorite restaurant.
[Person1]:  What do you think of our price? [Person2]:  Your price has gone up sharply, hasn't it? [Person1]:  Yes. We regret we cannot maintain our original price. Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised, we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly. [Person2]:  I agree with you there, but your price is unreasonable. [Person1]:  I don't think so. You must compare our price with that of other export houses. I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level. [Person2]:  I don't think we'll be able to pay the price. To have this business concluded, you need to lower your price at least by 3 %. [Person1]:  I ' m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price. [Person2]:  Don't you agree with me that in the long run, moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit? [Person1]:  We've already cut down our price to cost level. [Person2]:  Is that all? [Person1]:  Yes, this is the best we can do. [Person2]:  I'm sorry we can't handle the price you offered.
[Person1]:  Can you help me find a pan? [Person2]:  Are you looking for a small, medium, or large pan? [Person1]:  I want a big pan. [Person2]:  Does this one look big enough? [Person1]:  Yes, it's the right size, but it weighs too much. [Person2]:  Well, what do you think of the aluminum pan? [Person1]:  It's light enough, but the handle will get too hot after cooking. [Person2]:  Here's the same pan, but it has a space-age, heat-resistant plastic handle. [Person1]:  Oh, my family's going to love this one. I'll take it. [Person2]:  I'm so happy that you found what you wanted. Do you want to use a credit card? [Person1]:  Sure. Wait, wait. Does a lid come with this pan? [Person2]:  Oh, I'm sorry. Here's the lid. Yes, it comes with the pan.
[Person1]:  Would you like to come over for dinner tonight? [Person2]:  Sure, but I have to tell you that I've become a vegetarian. I don't eat any kind of meat. [Person1]:  When did you decide to become a vegetarian? [Person2]:  I saw a program a few months ago about how animals are raised for human consumption. I haven't been able to eat a single piece of meat since. [Person1]:  That's great. Do you find that you eat a lot more fruit and vegetables now? [Person2]:  Definitely. I've also been buying organic fruit and vegetables, which is more expensive, but much better for you because they don't have any pesticides on them. [Person1]:  You've really turned into a health nut, haven't you? [Person2]:  I guess you could say that. Eating fruit and vegetables helps keep you healthy. I've lost 5 pounds and I feel great! [Person1]:  How do you get enough protein in your diet? [Person2]:  Well, I eat a lot more tofu, beans, nuts and some fish. [Person1]:  Well, don't worry about dinner. I'll only make vegetarian dishes for you. Do you like sushi? [Person2]:  I prefer cooked fish to raw fish, but if you really like it, make it. [Person1]:  How about a spicy tofu and vegetable stir-fry? [Person2]:  That sounds great. What time should I come over? [Person1]:  Dinner will be ready at about 7 [Person2]:  Sounds good. See you there!
[Person1]:  I'd like to meet you again sometime. [Person2]:  That would be great. Actually, can I get your phone number, Ella? That's assuming you don't mind if I call you sometime. [Person1]:  Anytime. You can reach me at 5558929. [Person2]:  Ok, got it. I will call you sometime next week. [Person1]:  Fine. [Person2]:  It's time to go. Bye, Ella. Hope to see you soon. [Person1]:  Bye, Jason.
[Person1]:  Hurry up, get in. [Person2]:  I'm in, let's go! [Person1]:  OK, make a left here. . . no wait, I meant make a right. Come on, speed up! [Person2]:  Geez! What's the rush? [Person1]:  Don't worry about it, just drive. Oh, no, the light is about to change. . . step on it! [Person2]:  Are you nuts! I'm not going to run a red light! [Person1]:  Whatever. Just turn right here. . . . The freeway will be packed at this hour. . . . let's take a side street. Go on! Get out of our way! Move, move! [Person2]:  What's your problem! Geez. Having a fit is not going to help! [Person1]:  Here, I know a short cut. . . just go down here, and we'll cut though Ashburn Heights. Let's go, let's go! Watch out for that lady! [Person2]:  I'm going as fast as I can! [Person1]:  Yes! We made it. 5 [Person2]:  You're such a geek!
[Person1]:  When it comes to select a fund, you will always read Past performance is not an indication of future results, can you believe that? [Person2]:  Maybe it is right since everything is possible. You know the market changes quickly these days. But I still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance. For me, his stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy. I really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns. [Person1]:  If you refuse to take risk, you can't have better returns. [Person2]:  I will think about it.
[Person1]:  Excuse me. Would you tell me where The People's Park is? [Person2]:  The People's Park is located on Nanjing Road, near Limbo road, just on the opposite side of the International Hotel. [Person1]:  How long will it take me to get there? [Person2]:  Only about twenty minutes. [Person1]:  I'm not going in the wrong direction, am I? [Person2]:  No, you aren't. Just go ahead, please. [Person1]:  May I take a bus to get there? [Person2]:  You can take the No. 22 trolley bus to get there. [Person1]:  OK. Thank you a lot.
[Person1]:  Hi, Mike! Now that the midterms are over, some of us are planning to go boating this weekend. You want to come along? [Person2]:  Sounds great, but I've never done it before. [Person1]:  Oh, come on! None of the others have either except me. And this is our last chance to take a break before finals. [Person2]:  Yeah, what shall I have to bring then? [Person1]:  In fact, I wish we could take your car there. Mine's in the repair shop again. [Person2]:  Oh, I see. It's not me you want, it's my car. [Person1]:  Don't be silly. So what would you say? [Person2]:  Oh, why not! [Person1]:  Great! I'll give you a call when I find out when everyone wants to leave on Friday. [Person2]:  OK!
[Person1]:  Good morning, this is Burt's Bicycle Rental. [Person2]:  Good morning, Miss. A friend of mine suggested I call you to hire some bikes. [Person1]:  Oh, yes. A lot of people do this these days. [Person2]:  Yes, we're just on holiday here for a few days and they said it would be a good idea to see the island by bicycle. [Person1]:  Well, it certainly is. And most people rent a motor bike because you can get around faster and even go to the beach if you like. [Person2]:  If I wanted to hire 2 motor bikes tomorrow morning for 2 days, would there be any problem? [Person1]:  No problem at all. May I know your name? [Person2]:  It's Green, G-R-E-E-N. [Person1]:  And your telephone number? [Person2]:  I'm at the Holiday Sun Hotel. My number is 0708112, I'm in Room 1203. By the way, is your bike rental shop at No.100 Teckman Street? [Person1]:  That's right. [Person2]:  OK, then, I'll see you tomorrow morning. Thanks a lot. [Person1]:  I'll see you then.
[Person1]:  You heard who won the election, didn't you? [Person2]:  Yeah. I am so excited that Obama won. [Person1]:  I'm so happy that he did. [Person2]:  That man just made history. [Person1]:  Did you vote for him? [Person2]:  I sure did! What about you? [Person1]:  Of course I did! [Person2]:  I am still in shock to know that he was elected. [Person1]:  I am, too! [Person2]:  I pray that he actually makes things better in this country. [Person1]:  I'm sure that he will. [Person2]:  I know he will, too.
[Person1]:  Good afternoon, Sam.  [Person2]:  Good afternoon, Tina.  [Person1]:  What are you going to do tomorrow?  [Person2]:  I'm not sure yet. And you?  [Person1]:  I would like to go skating. Feel like going with me?  [Person2]:  Is skating interesting?  [Person1]:  I think so. Fresh air, white snow. It's so comfortable.  [Person2]:  But I can't skate well.  [Person1]:  It doesn't matter, I can teach you.  [Person2]:  It's very kind of you. 
[Person1]:  finally we're on board!  [Person2]:  yes. It was so crowded. I'm worn-out. Let's find our seats.  [Person1]:  are they window seats or aisle seats?  [Person2]:  let me see... yes, one window seat and one aisle seat.  [Person1]:  ok. But can I trade my seat with you? I prefer the one near the window. I'm a terrible flyer. I always get airsick and can never relax until after I've landed.  [Person2]:  that's fine. I'd like to be on the aisle anyway. It's easier to get in and out.  [Person1]:  thanks. Where shall we put our luggage?  [Person2]:  I think the smaller carry-on bag can go in the overhead compartment, and the others can go under the seat.  [Person1]:  good idea.  [Person2]:  don't forget to keep the seat belt on.  [Person1]:  ok. Hope it's a pleasant trip.  [Person2]:  yes!  [Person1]:  and no hijackers.  [Person2]:  oh, you have too wild of an imagination. 
[Person1]:  How old is Keith?  [Person2]:  He's 21. how old is James?  [Person1]:  He's a year older than Keith, but he looks younger.  [Person2]:  How's your father?  [Person1]:  He's fine. He retired last week. It's turning poing in his life. Now he can relax and enjoy his retirement.  [Person2]:  He can spend more time with his grandchilder.  [Person1]:  Oh, I don't think he wants to. He wants to travel to several different countries around the world.  [Person2]:  So, he wants to have a more active retirement. Good idea!  [Person1]:  How do you want to spend your old age?  [Person2]:  In the same way, probably. 
[Person1]:  Excuse me. May I have a bus map, please? [Person2]:  You mean one for the city? [Person1]:  Yes, within New York. [Person2]:  I'm afraid we don't have any. If I were you, I'd try one of the newspaper stands. [Person1]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  Hi Sue. How's it going? [Person2]:  Oh, hi, Frank. Just fine. How are your classes? [Person1]:  Pretty good. I'm glad this is my last term here though. [Person2]:  Why is that? I thought you were enjoying school. [Person1]:  I was, but now I'm getting tired of it. I'm ready for the real world. [Person2]:  What are you planning to do when you graduate? [Person1]:  First, I want to get a job as a computer programmer and then after 5 years or so I'd like to start my own business. [Person2]:  Sounds good. I still have 3 terms to go until I'm done. [Person1]:  You'll make it for sure. Well, see you later. [Person2]:  Bye.
[Person1]:  I heard you into town yesterday. [Person2]:  Oh yes, I had a meeting with the bank manager. My husband and I have decided to buy a new house, so we need a loan from the bank. [Person1]:  How did it go? [Person2]:  The meeting went well, but getting there was not so pleasant. I found a parking space just outside the bank. But just as I started backing into the space, another car drove into it. [Person1]:  That was rude. You must have been very angry. [Person2]:  Yes, I open my window and shouted at the other driver. [Person1]:  What did that driver do? [Person2]:  He just ignored me and walked away. It took me 20 minutes to find another place.
[Person1]:  I just want tickets to go see a live video taping of doctor Phil and Los Angelus. Do you want to go with me? [Person2]:  Who is doctor Phil? [Person1]:  You don't know who doctor Phil is? I watch him on TV every day. He's the host of a popular television show. He helps people get through life's most difficult situations. It's a great show, you should watch it. [Person2]:  When are you going down to Los Angeles? [Person1]:  I'm leaving on May twenty-first and returning on the twenty-third. [Person2]:  I have never been to Los Angeles, can we go to Hollywood? [Person1]:  Sure, maybe we'll even see some big movie stars. Your husband will be so jealous. [Person2]:  I really want to go. I'll see if I can get those days off work and then I'll let you know.
[Person1]:  Hello. Front desk. [Person2]:  Yes. This is Bob Robinson. I ' m calling from room number 627. [Person1]:  Hi, Bob. What can I do for you? [Person2]:  Is it possible to change to another room? [Person1]:  Could you please tell me why? [Person2]:  My room is facing the swimming pool. It ' s noisy for me. I have a problem sleeping. And I feel uncomfortable when I take an elevator. [Person1]:  So you need a quiet side room on the lower floor. [Person2]:  You ' re right. [Person1]:  Okay. Let me check for a room on the first floor. [Person2]:  Thank you. [Person1]:  I ' Ve only two rooms on the first floor. How about room 108? [Person2]:  That ' s fine. Can I move now? [Person1]:  Sure. I ' ll send the bellman to help you. [Person2]:  Oh, thank you kindly. [Person1]:  You ' re welcome.
[Person1]:  Good afternoon. May I help you? [Person2]:  Yes. I'd like to check in, please. [Person1]:  May I see your ticket and passport, please? [Person2]:  Sure. Here they are. [Person1]:  Please put your baggage on the scale. [Person2]:  What's the weight limit? [Person1]:  Thirty two kilos. [Person2]:  I hope my baggage aren't overweight. [Person1]:  No. They aren't. [Person2]:  May I carry this satchel? [Person1]:  Sure. But please attach this claim tag. [Person2]:  OK. [Person1]:  Here is your boarding pass. [Person2]:  Which gate? [Person1]:  Gate Four. Please go and have a seat in the waiting hall. [Person2]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  Charlotte, have you had your supper? [Person2]:  No, I don't want to eat anything. [Person1]:  Why? Don't you feel well? [Person2]:  I'm down in spirits. [Person1]:  What's up? [Person2]:  My manager jumped on me for my mistake today. [Person1]:  You must not feel depressed about such a trivial thing. [Person2]:  I think I'm too clumsy. I can do nothing well. [Person1]:  You'd better shape up if you want to get the job done. [Person2]:  But I doubt myself. [Person1]:  Cheer up! Don't let me down. We all make mistakes, and that is life.
[Person1]:  There will be a party in my company ; what shall I wear? [Person2]:  Is it formal or informal? [Person1]:  I guess it is a formal one because the general director will give a speech there, and most of the staff will take part in. [Person2]:  In that case, formal suit with a nice tie will be better. [Person1]:  You are right. What about shoes? [Person2]:  The brown leather shoes are OK. [Person1]:  Thanks a lot. [Person2]:  Don't mention it.
[Person1]:  I don't know what to say. This can't be happening. Here's the obituary. [Person2]:  It's really there? This all seems so surreal-like it's all one big nightmare. [Person1]:  But it explains why Taylor isn't answering and Femi took time off from work. [Person2]:  Poor Femi. Taylor's death must have made her realize that she still cared for him. [Person1]:  This says the viewing is at Myers Funeral Home today until five. [Person2]:  It's already half past four. We should go and pay our respects. Taylor's family will be there.
[Person1]:  Today people are hearing about information superhighways and the intermet. [Person2]:  Is this change going to be beneficial for theindividuals like you and me. [Person1]:  Yes, I think so. My friend once used it mostly to play chess, but now he has learnt how to do other things on the Internet. [Person2]:  There's no doubt the Internet will be a powerful commercial medium. It'll connect hundreds of millions of customers and open up huge markets for all kinds of products and services. [Person1]:  That's true. I can imagine companies sending advertisements directly to customers over the net. Customers, in turn, can examine and compare whatever goods they want to buy and tell their computers to find them at the best price offered. [Person2]:  Yeah. It'll be a shoppers heaven. That's the use of net in E-commerce.
[Person1]:  How do you get along with your co-workers? [Person2]:  I get along pretty well with most of them. It seems there are always a few rotten apples in the bunch, though, Like Margaret. I don't know why management hasn't fired her yet. She's a terrible gossip. [Person1]:  Do you think management should fire someone just because they gossip? [Person2]:  It's not only that she gossips, but she also tries to start problems among other employees by spreading rumors and telling lies about her co-workers. She's not trustworthy, and in my opinion, I think she's nuts. [Person1]:  So how do you develop good relationships in the office? [Person2]:  I think one of the important things is just to be considerate of your co-workers'feelings and needs. If you are aware of other people and do your part to make a good working environment, you should be able to get along with most of the people you work with. [Person1]:  I think you're right, but it does seem that there are always a few co, workers that are harder to work with than others.
[Person1]:  Hi, how are you doing? [Person2]:  I'm fine. How about yourself? [Person1]:  I'm pretty good. Thanks for asking. [Person2]:  No problem. So how have you been? [Person1]:  I've been great. What about you? [Person2]:  I've been good. I'm in school right now. [Person1]:  What school do you go to? [Person2]:  I go to PCC. [Person1]:  Do you like it there? [Person2]:  It's okay. It's a really big campus. [Person1]:  Good luck with school. [Person2]:  Thank you very much.
[Person1]:  Good afternoon, Ladies. May I help you? [Person2]:  Can we have two a joining double room, sir? [Person1]:  Have you made a reservation ladies? [Person2]:  I'm afraid not. [Person1]:  One moment, please. I have to check if there are room available. I'm sorry ladies. We have only two double room available, but they are on different floors. Would you mind that? [Person2]:  We prefer they are on same floor because we have a problem check late that night. [Person1]:  May I suggest family sweet? You all just have a consolation. [Person2]:  what's it like? [Person1]:  It's a big room with a king - size double bed and two single beds. You'Ve get also an roller-wheels. [Person2]:  That's great. How much is it? [Person1]:  2000 Hongkong dollars per night plus ten percent service charge and five percent government tax. [Person2]:  That's fine. [Person1]:  But, ladies, the room's not yet ready. It will be delay about half an hour. Perhaps you can fill the registration form first. And rest at the lobby for a while. We'll let you know when the room ' s ready. [Person2]:  Alright. thanks. [Person1]:  Ladies, Hotel policy requires one nine of room charge as deposit. [Person2]:  Do you take traveller's check? [Person1]:  Yes, we do, Madam. Thank you, madam. Here's our welcome brochure with all of information of our facilities. My name is John. If you need any help do let me know. I'm at your service.
[Person1]:  Who's that over here? [Person2]:  That's the new teacher. [Person1]:  What do you think of the teacher? [Person2]:  She's very nice. [Person1]:  What does she teach? [Person2]:  English, of course. [Person1]:  Is she your teacher? [Person2]:  Yes. She teaches our class three times a week. [Person1]:  Can she speak Chinese to her students? [Person2]:  Not very much. [Person1]:  It's a good thing you can speak English!
[Person1]:  What in the world is that smell? [Person2]:  The aroma of roasting coffee beans. [Person1]:  Smells like you're baking something. What are those? [Person2]:  Green beans. They pop and turn brown when you roast them. [Person1]:  Cool! But isn't that a hot air popcorn popper? [Person2]:  This machine roasts the beans just right. If you roast them too long, or the temperature is too hot. . . [Person1]:  The beans will burn. I know. I've tasted burnt coffee before. . . yuck!
[Person1]:  Taxi. [Person2]:  Yes, sir, where are you going? [Person1]:  I am going to the railway station. [Person2]:  Get on, please. [Person1]:  Thank you. Can we get there in half an hour? [Person2]:  I am not sure, sir. Generally we can, but look at the traffic. It's the rush hour. [Person1]:  My train will leave at 3 [Person2]:  We are really in a hurry. [Person1]:  Can't we go faster? [Person2]:  I'll do my best.
[Person1]:  Could you help me? [Person2]:  What do you need? [Person1]:  I can't seem to find my class. [Person2]:  What building is it in? [Person1]:  It's in the C building. [Person2]:  Oh, I know exactly where that is. [Person1]:  Do you think you can tell me where it is? [Person2]:  Sure, what room number is it? [Person1]:  It's room number 261. [Person2]:  I have a class around there right now. [Person1]:  Could you show me where it is? [Person2]:  No problem, come on.
[Person1]:  Good morning. [Person2]:  Good morning. Are you through with the cleaning? If not, we'll come back a little later. [Person1]:  Never mind, come right in. I've almost finished. You always keep the room neat and tidy, I must say. It saves me a lot of work, but you should let me do it. [Person2]:  It doesn't take much time. I'm used to tidying up my room myself. [Person1]:  It's very considerate of you to do so. Do you have any laundry today? [Person2]:  I have a suit that needs cleaning. [Person1]:  Let me have it, please. I'm taking some laundry downstairs anyway.
[Person1]:  The job sounds great, but I'm a little worried about how much time it might take. [Person2]:  It's pretty reasonable. It never took me more than five hours a week to do all the grading and then another thirty to forty minutes to record the grades on the computer. [Person1]:  That sounds manageable. I guess you can do the work when it fits into your own schedule, too, can't you? [Person2]:  Oh, yah, you can do the grading in your room or in the library. You just need to get each set back for the next class, but that means you always have at least two days and sometimes four. [Person1]:  It sounds great. [Person2]:  Good luck with your interview.
[Person1]:  Oh, look, who's here? Upon my word, if it isn't Mr. White. Oh, Mr. White, you shouldn't have come. [Person2]:  That's all right. I was told the weather was not good enough. [Person1]:  Yes, not ideal for flying. [Person2]:  If it doesn't clear up soon, I'm afraid the flight might be put off. [Person1]:  Let's hope for the best. [Person2]:  Mrs. Smith, do you like traveling by air? [Person1]:  For me there is nothing like traveling by air. It is both speedy and comfortable. Mr. White, there goes the announcement for passengers to board. [Person2]:  Oh, good news for you. The plane will take off on time as it is clearing up. [Person1]:  I think I must go now. Thank you for coming to see me off, Mr. White. [Person2]:  It's a pleasure. Come again, I wish you a pleasant journey. [Person1]:  Thank you. Good-bye.
[Person1]:  What do you think of doctor Tompson?  [Person2]:  I feel confident of his ability to cure my daughter's disease.  [Person1]:  How can you be so sure?  [Person2]:  I can tell from the way he spoke to us.  [Person1]:  Never believe his words. 
[Person1]:  Are there many idioms in English?  [Person2]:  There are hundreds and hundreds. English is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions.  [Person1]:  Can you give us an example?  [Person2]:  I'll look up the rate. To look up doesn't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof. It means to search for and find some information.  [Person1]:  What about the expression 'goodbye'? Is that an idiom?  [Person2]:  That is just a natural, grammatical English expression. It has a direct translation in other languages.  [Person1]:  This is interesting, Ms. Parker. 
[Person1]:  Hello! [Person2]:  Oh, hi! [Person1]:  Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Tom. [Person2]:  Pleased to meet you. My name is Alice. Did you just move in next door? [Person1]:  Yes, I did. Have you lived here long? [Person2]:  Me? I guess so. I've lived here for about six years now. Have you lived in America very long? [Person1]:  No, not really. When I left Vietnam, I came to America and I lived with a cousin in Dallas for two years. Where do you work, Alice? [Person2]:  I teach mathematics at a college. What do you do? [Person1]:  I am an accountant at a company. [Person2]:  Well, Tom. It's good to meet you. I have to go now. I am teaching a class this evening, and I need to get to the college. [Person1]:  It's nice meeting you too, Alice. [Person2]:  See you around! [Person1]:  Goodbye, Alice.
[Person1]:  Would you consider buying a self-driving car? [Person2]:  I don't know. I guess I'd have to research a bit more about them before making that decision. [Person1]:  It will probably be a while before we are able to buy them anyway. We might be seeing self-driving trucks on the road pretty soon, though. Google wants to change the commercial trucking industry. Right now, there are over 3 million truck drivers in the US, so adding self-driving trucks would likely take away a lot of jobs. But many drivers might still be able to accompany their trucks and get a full night's sleep in the process. [Person2]:  Truck drivers cause a lot of accidents on the freeway, so I think I'd like to see self-driving trucks. It would make me feel safer on the road. [Person1]:  Really? I think it might make me feel less safe. A human driver is much more likely to react quickly to something unexpected.
[Person1]:  Which type of washing machine have you decided on? [Person2]:  I'm still not sure. [Person1]:  We have many brands. Little Swan is domestic. Philipson, Panasonic are imported. [Person2]:  Which one is of the highest quality? [Person1]:  It's hard to say. Some customers preferred domestic ones, because they are cheaper. And others believe imported ones are more dependable. I think they are the same quality, but the price is quite different. [Person2]:  I don't care what the price is if the quality is guaranteed.
[Person1]:  How do you manage to cook your own meals all the time? [Person2]:  Well, I guess my planning ahead and making sure that I always have enough ingredients at home. [Person1]:  You must go to the supermarket a lot then. [Person2]:  Yeah, I used to go every other day, but it still took a lot of time, so I only go twice a week now. [Person1]:  Do you go on the same days every week? [Person2]:  I do actually. I go on every Thursday and Sunday. [Person1]:  Why these 2 particular days? [Person2]:  I shop for the following week on Sunday. On Thursday I shop for the weekend. [Person1]:  I see. Sounds like a good plan. [Person2]:  Yeah, how often do you go to the supermarket? [Person1]:  Oh, I go probably twice a month. I order food delivery sometimes, but mostly I just eat out at restaurants. [Person2]:  You should go to the supermarket and cook more often. It's not that hard and it'll save you a lot of money. [Person1]:  I know, but I always have much work to do. It's hard to find the time.
[Person1]:  I called HP about my computer. [Person2]:  What did they say? [Person1]:  They said I need a new hard drive. [Person2]:  That's too bad. How much is a new one? [Person1]:  It's not too much, only about $ 85. [Person2]:  Plus installation? [Person1]:  No, my hard drive is easy to remove and replace. [Person2]:  Really? [Person1]:  Yes, it's just a couple of screws. [Person2]:  That's nice. [Person1]:  It's a lot better than paying someone $ 60. [Person2]:  If my hard drive crashes, I'll just call you.
[Person1]:  Eric, how long will you be in China? [Person2]:  I don't know. Well, my contract here is for one year, and I don't know what I should do after that. Maybe going around for a while. [Person1]:  Well, have you ever thought about learning some Chinese? [Person2]:  Actually, I am learning that now. But it's too hard for me. You know the four tones and the stuff. It really freaks me out. [Person1]:  Don't worry. All things are difficult before they are easy. [Person2]:  You hit the nail right on the head. [Person1]:  Well, are you invested in some language-exchange program? [Person2]:  What is it? [Person1]:  It's where I teach you Chinese, and in exchange you teach me English. [Person2]:  Awesome. I've been giving this a lot of thought. When can we do this? [Person1]:  How about this sunday? [Person2]:  Ok, cool. [Person1]:  Good. I'll give you a call tonight. [Person2]:  No problem. [Person1]:  Bye.
[Person1]:  I didn't expect to see you at this hour. You must have goofed off again. [Person2]:  Goofed off? Maybe, but I'm not a clock-watcher. I finished doing what I should do and then knock off an hour earlier. [Person1]:  You'll be sorry if the boss finds it out. He may probably give you the bag. [Person2]:  I'm sure of what I'm doing.
[Person1]:  Excuse me. I am from STM. We are carrying out a survey on the traffic in our city. Do you mind if I ask you some questions? [Person2]:  No, not at all. Go ahead. [Person1]:  Good, thanks. What do you do, sir? [Person2]:  I am a teacher. I teach children French. [Person1]:  Great. Do you live far from the school? I mean, how do you usually go to work? [Person2]:  Well, mostly by car. But once in a while, I prefer to ride my bike. You know, I live quite far from the school, about 20 miles. And I have to spend about an hour riding to school. But it only takes me less than a quarter of an hour to drive my car, unless the traffic is very bad. [Person1]:  I see. Does this happen often? I mean the bad traffic. [Person2]:  Yes, sure! I often get stuck on the way, and the problem's getting worse and worse. [Person1]:  That's all of my questions. Thank you very much. [Person2]:  You are welcome.
[Person1]:  I was looking at my test score and think that it should be higher. [Person2]:  Is the math wrong or the way the answer was marked? [Person1]:  I think an answer got marked wrong that should have been marked right. [Person2]:  These things can happen ; let's double-check the answers first to be sure, all right? [Person1]:  That would be great! [Person2]:  Look at the answer sheet and compare it to your answers. Do you see any place where I made a mistake in grading? [Person1]:  This one right here should be right. [Person2]:  Yeah, I see the same thing ; now we can do the math and check that, right? [Person1]:  Yeah, let's do the math. [Person2]:  I count all of the correct answers, total them, and divide by the total. Does this look right to you? [Person1]:  Looks pretty good. [Person2]:  Thank you for caring enough to check on your scores ; keep studying!
[Person1]:  Hey, Jim. I didn't know you biked to work. [Person2]:  Yeah, it helps keep me fit and helps the environment, too. [Person1]:  One less car on the road means less pollution. [Person2]:  Right. Since my work is near a park, it's a really nice ride, too. [Person1]:  How far is it? [Person2]:  Oh, about 10 miles. It takes me about an hour. [Person1]:  That doesn't sound too bad. I wish I could do it, but I work in the city. So I take the train. [Person2]:  You're doing your part for the environment by using public transportation, too. [Person1]:  True. Well, see you tomorrow. [Person2]:  See you.
[Person1]:  Hi, Michael, how's it going? [Person2]:  Well, things are all right. [Person1]:  I heard you got a new roommate. What's he like? [Person2]:  Yeah, Bob moved in last week. He is a nice guy and so far everything is cool except this girlfriend. [Person1]:  Oh? What's wrong with his girlfriend? [Person2]:  She came over last weekend. She is a nice girl but there's something about her voice that really creeps me out. I tried to smile and be polite, but the whole time all I could think was ' what's wrong with your voice? ' [Person1]:  Well, I guess it might take some time to get used to. [Person2]:  I doubt it. Last time was an oral train wreck. Listening to her talk is like chewing tin foil. [Person1]:  Oh come on, it's not that bad. [Person2]:  No, it's so much worse. And tonight they invited me out to dinner. I really have no idea how I'm going to pull it off. [Person1]:  Rough. Maybe you can do the most of the talking. [Person2]:  That's the plan. [Person1]:  Good luck.
[Person1]:  What do you do in your free time, Nancy? [Person2]:  Well, I like playing the violin. [Person1]:  Really? How long have you been playing the violin? [Person2]:  About ten years so far. I started learning when I was in middle school. [Person1]:  That's really interesting. [Person2]:  Sure. So what about you? Do you have any hobbies? [Person1]:  Well, I like collecting matchbox! I'm not sure if that counts, though. [Person2]:  Of course it does. Everybody has his own hobby.
[Person1]:  Hello, Roger? This is Ann. [Person2]:  Hi, Ann. How have you been? And how's your new apartment working out? [Person1]:  Well, that's what I'm calling about. You see, I've decided to look for a new place. [Person2]:  Oh, what's the problem with your place now? I thought you liked the apartment. [Person1]:  I do, but it's a little far from the campus. Do you think you could help? [Person2]:  All right. So, what kind of place are you looking for? [Person1]:  Well, I'd like to share an apartment with one or two roommates within walking distance of school. [Person2]:  Okay, how much do you want to spend on rent? [Person1]:  Oh, somewhere under $ 200 a month. [Person2]:  Hmm. And anything else? [Person1]:  Yeah, I need a parking space. [Person2]:  Well, I know there's an apartment nearby. I'll drop by there on my way to class today. [Person1]:  Hey, thanks a lot. [Person2]:  No problem.
[Person1]:  Hey Lisa. . . want to grab lunch with me? [Person2]:  Sure, Emily. We haven't done that in a while. [Person1]:  Yeah. . . actually, we haven't hung out at all recently. You seem sort of under the weather. Is there something going on? [Person2]:  Well, keep this under your hat, but I think I'm going to quit after New Year. [Person1]:  Quit this company? Oh. . . wow. [Person2]:  I know I should be pretty happy here, but I'm not finding the kind of job satisfaction I need. I'm a good graphic designer. . . [Person1]:  One of the best in the company. [Person2]:  That's kind of you to say. But. . . the stuff we do here hasn't really challenged me very much at all. [Person1]:  Oh, I get it. Simply put, you're bored, huh? [Person2]:  That's one way of putting it. For me, a job needs to stimulate my brain, otherwise it becomes a daily drudgery.
[Person1]:  Listen, you can not afford another day off. You'Ve called in sick five times in the last three weeks. [Person2]:  I know, but I am really sick. [Person1]:  Well. I want a note from the doctor this one and to be honest, if it continues, we may not be able to have you here. [Person2]:  I understand, sir. I'll bring a doctor's note in tomorrow. I am sorry, Mr. Thomas
[Person1]:  Hi, John! Long time no see. [Person2]:  Julia! It must be over two years. The last time we met was at Kate's birthday party, wasn't it? [Person1]:  Oh, yes. That's right. How is life with you? [Person2]:  Well, I guess not too bad. You're getting a little fat. I can see your husband Michael must be feeding you too much, you must live a happy life! [Person1]:  Yeah. He enjoys cooking and the dishes he cooks are very delicious. But that's not the reason. The only trouble is I have no time for exercise. Anyway I should lose weight from now on. [Person2]:  Are you still working in that factory? You ought to have taken the job at our place when the manager offered the job to you. We have a strict five-day week and you're free at weekends. [Person1]:  I ought to have. Michael often complains about my working too long. Often when I come back home from work, my children have already fallen asleep. [Person2]:  Michael is right. You should spend more time with your family. Think it over, Julia. I could ask our manager. I think maybe he'll offer you a job. You suit our company so well!
[Person1]:  By the way, would you like to go to the movies this evening? [Person2]:  I'd love to. But I must write some emails. [Person1]:  Why tonight? [Person2]:  I haven't written to anyone for months. Sylvia and John must think I've forgotten them. [Person1]:  You don't have to write. You can call them tomorrow. It's half price on Sundays. [Person2]:  Yes, I could, couldn't I? All right. I'll do that. What's playing then? [Person1]:  Let's see. Here we are. The Columbia [Person2]:  No, thank you! [Person1]:  Central [Person2]:  There must be something worth seeing somewhere. [Person1]:  What about this? John Wayne in Texas, Here I Come. [Person2]:  I can't stand Westerns. [Person1]:  Neither can I. Listen, Joan. I've got a better idea... [Person2]:  Let's stay at home and wash down the kitchen walls! [Person1]:  Great idea!
[Person1]:  I can't decide whether to go to university or to get a job.  [Person2]:  Well, if I were you, I'd go on studying.  [Person1]:  But I don't even know what to study.  [Person2]:  If I had chance again, I'd major in English. You're good at language.  [Person1]:  That's what my parents want me to do.  [Person2]:  You should take their advice. They know what's best for you.  [Person1]:  But my friends will have jobs and lots of fun, while I spend all my time doing reading and writing.  [Person2]:  But if you go to university, you'll still have time for fun.  [Person1]:  Hm, what you say makes sense. But you know, I still have to ask my parents for pocket money, and I hate to do so at this age.  [Person2]:  And if you try to find a part-time job, you'll have some money too.  [Person1]:  You're right. Thank you for the advice. 
[Person1]:  Excuse me. We'd like to rent a flat near the university. [Person2]:  OK. How many people are you looking for somewhere for? [Person1]:  2. We'd like something as cheap as possible. [Person2]:  OK. How many rooms do you need in the flat? [Person1]:  We'll need 2 bedrooms, the kitchen and dining room can be separate or combined. [Person2]:  OK. I've got a list of places that fit your requirements. Let's just go through them. The first flat is about 2 miles away from your university and it's near the Walmart. [Person1]:  Well, can we go to have a look at it? We'd like to see it before making a final decision. [Person2]:  Of course. I'm not very busy at the moment. If you can wait for about 15 minutes, I can take you there. [Person1]:  Thank you. That would be great.
[Person1]:  I was almost fooled by a telephone call yesterday. [Person2]:  What's it about? [Person1]:  A week's vacation for two. But I realized it was a cheat when they told me to ring a special telephone number to claim the price. [Person2]:  Well,those calls are charged at unbelievably high rates.
[Person1]:  Honey, let's eat out tonight. [Person2]:  What for? [Person1]:  I got promoted. [Person2]:  Really? That's great. It's a big moment. We should celebrate it but Linda is coming tonight. Can we make it another time? [Person1]:  Linda is coming? That's it. Linda will come with us and we can enjoy a family dinner together, it must be a wonderful time. [Person2]:  Sounds good. It is half a year since we had a family dinner, have you booked a table for 4? [Person1]:  For 4? There are just three of us. [Person2]:  Our granddaughter, Shelly is coming along and today is her fifth birthday. [Person1]:  It's a real surprise. I can't wait to see her. I'll call and make a reservation right now.
[Person1]:  Julia, look at me! I'm gaining weight. How could I lose weight? Do you have any good ideas? [Person2]:  Since summer is coming, I think swimming is a good way for you to do. [Person1]:  Are you sure? [Person2]:  Of course! Swimming can help you stay in shape by targeting all parts of your body. [Person1]:  Really? Does swimming have other advantages? [Person2]:  It could also help you increase vital capacity. [Person1]:  That's great. Okay, from now on I would swim three times a week. I hope I can get rid of the weight. [Person2]:  You will make it if you persist in it.
[Person1]:  Did you go see the doctor about your cough? [Person2]:  The doctor said if I keep smoking it will increase my chance of having a heart attack or lung disease. And I am thinking about quitting smoking as the problems seem to be quite serious.
[Person1]:  Jenny, you look terrible. What's eating you? [Person2]:  Don't brother me! [Person1]:  Hey, chill out, I'm just trying to help. [Person2]:  Sorry, Sally, it's not your fault. [Person1]:  So, what's the problem? [Person2]:  I drew a blank on the algebra test. [Person1]:  No kidding! Didn't you study for it? [Person2]:  Yeah, but nothing was clear during the test. [Person1]:  That's too bad, anyway, I'm sure things will turn around next semester. [Person2]:  I'm thinking of dropping out. [Person1]:  You can't do that, Jenny! [Person2]:  I'm dead serious about this, Sally. [Person1]:  Come on, let's talk about it.
[Person1]:  Mike, come and look at this painting of shrimp! It is so simple yet so vivid! [Person2]:  Yeah. It is incredible! Is it the work of Qi Bakshi? [Person1]:  Yes, it is. How do you know that? [Person2]:  Well, Qi is famous all over the world, isn't he? Besides I am quite interested in Chinese painting. [Person1]:  Cool! What kind of Chinese painting do you prefer, free sketch or claborate-style painting? [Person2]:  I prefer free sketch, especially the landscape paintings. I can always feel peace and harmony from those landscape paintings. [Person1]:  That's true. Chinese art stresses the harmony between man and nature, which is an important part of China's traditional culture. [Person2]:  I love this art exhibition! [Person1]:  So do I. Let's go to other areas to see what they have got, shall we? [Person2]:  OK.
[Person1]:  Oh Gush! The first day of my career is over. I can not breathe now after dealing with so many documents. But I heard the notice that our company will hold two-week staff training. [Person2]:  Stop fussing! It is said that the training is important for our newcomers. And my company also informs me to attend the training next week. [Person1]:  But for me, the training is waste of my precious time. [Person2]:  I disagree with you. Companies usually make a workable and reasonable plan for the trainings, so as to improve new comers'understanding of the company and its rules in short time. Through the training, we get to know many things, such as the corporate culture and spirit. Our newcomers can really grasp the essence of the company
[Person1]:  Can you please give me a hand? I can't carry the heavy box. [Person2]:  I'm afraid not. Don't you see I'm looking up a word in the dictionary? [Person1]:  I think you are flicking through it. [Person2]:  Well, wait a minute.
[Person1]:  Hello, Tom. I haven't seen you for some time. How are you doing? [Person2]:  Oh! Not too bad. I have been busy writing an article. [Person1]:  Really? Have you finished it? [Person2]:  Yes. I finished it yesterday. [Person1]:  Congratulations! Are you doing something this evening? [Person2]:  No, nothing important. Why? [Person1]:  Well, do you feel like going to a concert? I have two tickets. [Person2]:  Oh. Good idea. I want to do something relaxing, and I like music very much. [Person1]:  Great. I'll meet you at your house at seven. Is that OK? [Person2]:  OK! See you at seven. [Person1]:  All right. See you then.
[Person1]:  Mom, I want to move out. [Person2]:  Hey, sounds great to me, kid. What kind of job did you find? [Person1]:  Job? [Person2]:  Yes, job. If you're going to live on your own, you have to pay for rent and everything else. [Person1]:  I thought I could just get you and Dad to pay for an apartment. I found a cheap one. [Person2]:  When you move out, your father and I aren't paying your rent, young man. Get a job. [Person1]:  You're right. If I'm going to live on my own, I have to be independent. [Person2]:  Well, the newspaper is over there. Look in the want ads, but I don't know what you're going to find without a college degree.
[Person1]:  You're just left school, haven't you, Emily?  [Person2]:  Yes, I finished last Friday.  [Person1]:  You sound relieved.  [Person2]:  Well, yes. I don't mind admitting that I am. I enjoyed school, but I did object to having to go in every day once we've done all our exams.  [Person1]:  Well, what are you going to do now? Have you made any plans?  [Person2]:  Yes, I intend to go to university. That'll be in September. But it all depends on my A level results.  [Person1]:  You mean getting into university actually depends on your passing your A level subjects?  [Person2]:  Oh, yes. 
[Person1]:  I've heard you are going to New York tomorrow. I'd like to see you off to the airport. [Person2]:  Oh. Thank you. That's very kind of you. [Person1]:  What time are you leaving for the airport? [Person2]:  8 [Person1]:  What airline and what flight? [Person2]:  Pan America Airlines. Flight 169. [Person1]:  I'll come to the hotel and pick you up at 8 [Person2]:  All right. See you tomorrow.
[Person1]:  Hi, Terry, you're just back from New York. [Person2]:  Yes. [Person1]:  It must be an exciting trip. [Person2]:  Well, I've really seen lots of things. I saw the most spectacular view when I was crossing a bridge to Manhattan at dusk, and the skyscrapers were lit up producing a classic nighttime view of Manhattan. [Person1]:  That's really beautiful. [Person2]:  But that's not the whole picture. Some of the streets in New York are very rough. I saw large piles of garbage cans at the roadside, and graffiti all over garage doors and store shutters. [Person1]:  I can't believe it. [Person2]:  The garbage are tidily bagged and boxed, though. [Person1]:  Did you stay in a hotel? [Person2]:  Yes. The hotel we stayed at turned out to be fairly decent, though the room was small, with a tiny bathroom that was only about 3 feet larger than the bed. As I was inexperienced with tourist-area hotels, I was startled, I mean, the room was $129 a night. But at least the room was clean and the bed reasonably comfortable. [Person1]:  What's your general impression of New York? [Person2]:  Well, restaurants pack their tiny tables very tightly; grocery stores and bookstores have aisles that are narrow; the sidewalks are cluttered with newsstands, vendors and their carts, and places that aren't restrictively small, such as the lawns around the Natural History Museum, are full of people, so they're no escape.
[Person1]:  Something wrong?  [Person2]:  Yes. My car is having problems.  [Person1]:  What's wrong?  [Person2]:  It won't start.  [Person1]:  Do you want me to take a look?  [Person2]:  No, thank you. I think I can handle it.  [Person1]:  Well, if you change your mind, let me know.  [Person2]:  I will. Thanks. That's sweet of you.  [Person1]:  No problem.  [Person2]:  I might need some tools though. Do you know where I can get some?  [Person1]:  Sure. I have all kinds of tools. Just ask. I'll be happy to get them for you.  [Person2]:  Thanks. That would be very helpful.  [Person1]:  Anything for you. Seriously, I don't mind helping.  [Person2]:  OK. If you really insist, I could always use the company. 
[Person1]:  What kind of a car do you have?  [Person2]:  An old one.  [Person1]:  I know it's old, but what make is it?  [Person2]:  It's a Chevrolet. Why do you ask? You going into the car business?  [Person1]:  Nothing like that. My cousin is going to take a job overseas and he can't take his car with him, so he's going to sell it - cheap. It's practically new.  [Person2]:  WelL I have been thinking about getting a newer car. I can't afford a brand new one.  [Person1]:  Would you like to look at my cousin's car?  [Person2]:  Is it a four-door or a two-door?  [Person1]:  It's a coupe with a vinyl roof.  [Person2]:  Does it have automatic transmission? .  [Person1]:  Yes, and it also has power steering, power brakes, and air conditioning.  [Person2]:  I guess I might take a look at it. 
[Person1]:  I'm searching for an old music box.  [Person2]:  You came to the right place. Any particular decade?  [Person1]:  If you had a box made in the '20s, that would be nice.  [Person2]:  We just got one in yesterday, so now we have six.  [Person1]:  Would any of them have dancing figures?  [Person2]:  Yes, we still have two boxes left that have dancing figures.  [Person1]:  Oh, they're both so beautiful. Let me have this one, I think.  [Person2]:  That one truly is a beautiful piece of work, isn't it?  [Person1]:  One last question  [Person2]:  Oh, no. Everything we sell here is 'as is. '  [Person1]:  I guess I was asking for too much.  [Person2]:  If it breaks down, maybe you can find a repairman on the Internet. 
[Person1]:  Would you like to see our new shirts?  [Person2]:  Sorry, but I'm not really that interested in those things.  [Person1]:  Well, they are very nice you know.  [Person2]:  Really?  [Person1]:  And not expensive either.  [Person2]:  Oh, I don't care about that.  [Person1]:  Everybody is buying them.  [Person2]:  Are they?  [Person1]:  Yes, they are very fashionable, you see.  [Person2]:  I am afraid I am not interested in fashion.  [Person1]:  I see.  [Person2]:  But thank you very much all the same.  [Person1]:  Sorry I couldn't help you. 
[Person1]:  Good morning.sir.My name is Liu Peng from Tsinghai University. I am here for the interview relating to my visa application.

[Person1]:  Hello. This is Mrs. Wilson. I'd like to buy a new car. Could you offer me a new type of the car, please? [Person2]:  Oh, Madam, buy what? [Person1]:  A new car. And I've got a small family, two children, and I haven't got a lot of money and... [Person2]:  Oh, oh, Madam, Madam, I'm afraid you have the wrong number. [Person1]:  Isn't this the car store? [Person2]:  No. It's Mike's Sporting Goods. [Person1]:  Oh, sorry. Do you know the number for a car store, then? [Person2]:  No. I don't. I suggest you look in the phone book. [Person1]:  I'm sorry to have bothered you. [Person2]:  No problem.
[Person1]:  Which window do I go to for parcel? [Person2]:  Here will be OK. [Person1]:  I want to mail this package. [Person2]:  Please put it on the scale. Where are you mailing it to? [Person1]:  Zhuhai. [Person2]:  Do you want to mail it by air or sea? [Person1]:  What's the difference in price? [Person2]:  25 yuan by air, 13 yuan by sea. [Person1]:  How long will it take by air? [Person2]:  About 2 days. [Person1]:  Then I will send it by air, thank you. [Person2]:  Please fill out this form, and what's in your package? [Person1]:  Just some souvenirs.

[Person1]:  Hey, Sandy, what's new? Interested in a movie tonight?  [Person2]:  I wish I could, but I'm busy. I'm going to work at a soup kitchen tonight.  [Person1]:  Soup kitchen? Is that a new restaurant or something?  [Person2]:  Nah, it's a place where homelesspeople go to eat.  [Person1]:  How did you get involved in something like that?  [Person2]:  Well, the minister at my church told us about it, and it seemed interesting. I thought I'd try it once, and if I didn't like it I'd stop.  [Person1]:  So what do you do there?  [Person2]:  It's simple. All we do is prepare some food, usually sandwiches and some fruit, and give it out to them at the soup kitchen.  [Person1]:  Yeah, it sounds easy. How long does it take?  [Person2]:  Only about two hours, for a couple of days a month. Why don't you give it a try?  [Person1]:  I don't know. I mean, I like helping the community and all that, but I don't know if I have the time... ...  [Person2]:  Come on, it's easy, and it'll make you feel good. Why don't you come with me tonight? 
[Person1]:  Hello, Walter? [Person2]:  Yes. Hi, what's up? [Person1]:  I was wondering if you wanted to go for a walk with us. [Person2]:  I'm afraid not. I'm sick. I have a fever but I'm cold, and I threw up earlier. [Person1]:  Oh, man. I hope you get to feeling better. [Person2]:  I would feel better if you came over and took care of me. [Person1]:  OK, then. I'll be there in a minute. [Person2]:  ( after a while. . . ) Walter! Where are you? [Person1]:  I'm in the bathroom. [Person2]:  What took you so long? [Person1]:  Gross. Diarrhea? [Person2]:  It's not so bad. [Person1]:  OK, whatever, I don't want to hear about it. I'll call the doctor for you. [Person2]:  It's just that you have to be patient and try to relax. [Person1]:  Enough. I don't want to hear any more about your bathroom time. [Person2]:  Why not? Oh well, I'm ready to eat. No need call the doctor. If we run to the restaurant, I can make it to the restroom and you can order. [Person1]:  Are you sure you want to go? [Person2]:  To the restroom? I have no choice.
[Person1]:  I want to say goodbye to everyone. [Person2]:  You're leaving so soon. When are you off? [Person1]:  I'm catching the 9 fifteen train tomorrow morning. [Person2]:  How about I come and see you off? [Person1]:  You really don't need to. [Person2]:  Ok. I'll miss you. I hope we can see each other again soon. [Person1]:  I hope so, too. Thank you, Lily. Thank you for everything. [Person2]:  You're welcome. [Person1]:  Please say goodbye to the rest of the family for me. [Person2]:  Ok. Take care. I hope you have a good journey.

[Person1]:  You're from New York, aren't you? [Person2]:  Yes, that's right. [Person1]:  What do you suggest I should see in New York? [Person2]:  Well, how about the Museum of Modern Art? [Person1]:  No, I don't like museums. They're boring. [Person2]:  Why don't you go to see the Empire State Building? [Person1]:  Ah! That sounds interesting.

[Person1]:  Hey, do you know if it's possible to get to Los Angeles from San Francisco by train? [Person2]:  Yeah, it is. But why don't you fly? It's much faster and costs about the same. [Person1]:  No way! I hate flying. Do you know how long the train takes? [Person2]:  Well, the quickest route is through the center of California. You can start in Sacramento. But it's not a very good route. If you take the train along the coast, it is much more beautiful. It's a great way to see California. [Person1]:  Well, I don't care about that. I just need to get to Los Angeles and back. My cousin's wedding is next month.
[Person1]:  Hi, Linda, this is John. What are you doing tonight? [Person2]:  Hi, John. Nothing much. It's Friday and I'm bored. I don't have any plans yet. What do you have in mind? [Person1]:  How about going to the movies? [Person2]:  Is there a good movie to see? [Person1]:  Let me surf the Internet. Do you want to see a comedy or a drama? [Person2]:  Nothing sad or depressing. I had a hard work week. I want to see something funny. [Person1]:  I agree. Work was stressful for me, too. There aren't any new comedies right now. I only see dramas and horror movies. [Person2]:  Hey, let's go to a comedy club. My favorite comedian is performing tonight at the local theater. It starts at 7 [Person1]:  OK. I'll meet you at your house at 5
[Person1]:  You're made a good choice. This china tea set is unusual.  [Person2]:  Where was it from?  [Person1]:  It was made in Jingdezhen.  [Person2]:  Jingdezhen? Isn't it called 'the capital of porcelain'?  [Person1]:  You are right.  [Person2]:  This is the very thing I've been dreaming of.  [Person1]:  It is the best quality porcelain-the famous egg-shell China.  [Person2]:  It must be most precious.  [Person1]:  But it is really worth the price. 
[Person1]:  My goodness! What happened? You have blood on your face.  [Person2]:  Oh, don't worry. I just killed a pigeon.  [Person1]:  How could you have the heart to kill it ? We only have one!  [Person2]:  It spoiled my painting! 
[Person1]:  What kind of person do you consider yourself to be?  [Person2]:  I think I'm polite, careful, relaxed and shy.  [Person1]:  Oh, I don't think you're shy! You are always chatting with new people when we go to a party.  [Person2]:  Well. Yes, but those people always start talking to me. I never talk to them first. Perhaps I'm not as shy as I think. Anyway, you're certainly not shy!  [Person1]:  You're right. I love going out and making new friends.  [Person2]:  So, you'll be at my birthday party on Friday?  [Person1]:  Of course! 
[Person1]:  They promised us a sea view.  [Person2]:  Well, you can just see the sea. Between the factory chimneys.  [Person1]:  Isn't it awful? I can't bear to look at it. I don't think I can stand this place for two weeks.  [Person2]:  Well, it can't be helped. We'll just have to put up with it. 
[Person1]:  Hey, I heard you were leaving San Francisco. [Person2]:  That's right. By next week, I'll be living in the Big Apple. [Person1]:  New York. Why? I thought you loved the West Coast. [Person2]:  I do. It's beautiful and the weather is perfect, but I'm trying to make it as a singer and it's impossible here. All of the music clubs here have closed down in the last few years. [Person1]:  Do you know why? [Person2]:  Yeah, as housing prices have gone up, clubs have been torn down to build new apartments. [Person1]:  That's true. Now the only places to go in San Francisco are fancy restaurants. [Person2]:  Yeah, so there isn't anywhere to perform. [Person1]:  OK, but won't your family miss you? [Person2]:  I only have a brother here. Most of my family is actually in Philadelphia. I'll be much closer to them once I move. [Person1]:  Isn't it expensive in New York? [Person2]:  It is, but San Francisco has also become quite expensive in the past few years. My rent will be about the same. [Person1]:  Wow. Well. Are you sure you'll be able to find places to perform? [Person2]:  Yes, I've actually scheduled a performance already and it's important that I do not waste anytime. I'm 26 years old and I need to make a name for myself in the next 4 years. [Person1]:  Wow, most women at your age are thinking about getting married. [Person2]:  Not me. I don't think I will ever get married. I just want to sing.

[Person1]:  Fine, and could you tell me what kind of work experience you've had? [Person2]:  My last position was with Lumison Marten. That was from two thousand and five to two thousand and nine. That's a law firm in Sacramento. Before that I worked for a bishop in Baldwin. That was from two thousand and three to two thousand and five. [Person1]:  Could you tell me what kind of salary you are expecting? [Person2]:  Well, in my last job, I was making $1,500 a month. I understand that this position has a starting salary of around $1,600 a month. [Person1]:  That's right. [Person2]:  That would be fine with me. What I care about most is if the company provides opportunities for further education. [Person1]:  Yes, our employees are allowed to take up to six hours a week at full pay to attend college courses.
[Person1]:  Hello. [Person2]:  Hello. Is Steve there? [Person1]:  I'm sorry. He's not here right now. [Person2]:  What time will he be back? [Person1]:  Around five thirty.

[Person1]:  It's Saturday tomorrow, so what's your plan? [Person2]:  I'm so exhausted this week. I'll stay at home and relax myself. [Person1]:  You mean you'll get some sleep and watch several NBA games huh? [Person2]:  Yes, especially the game of Cavaliers. [Person1]:  Why do you love NBA games so much? [Person2]:  NBA games are exciting, the outcome can be changed in only a few seconds. And there are fascinating skills, how about you? What will you do this weekend, go skating as usual? [Person1]:  I'm worn out, too, and I'll stay in the dormitory and see some videos about skateboarding. [Person2]:  How long have you been skateboarding? 3 years or 4 years? I don't remember it exactly. [Person1]:  About 4 years, during those 4 years I watch videos about skateboarding and practice the skills once and once again, you may feel it boring and painful, but I take delight in it. Every advancing skills brings me a great sense of fulfillment, every time I jump into the sky, I feel I'm flying. [Person2]:  Wow, amazing.
[Person1]:  I am thinking about resigning from my current job. [Person2]:  Have you thought about it seriously? [Person1]:  Yes, I have been thinking about it for quite a while. Now I finally make up my mind to leave. I have given my resignation letter to our boss last Friday. [Person2]:  Ok, did you find a new company? [Person1]:  Yes, I will move on to XYZ Company.

[Person2]:  Right behind Macy's is a bus stop. [Person1]:  The stop is really at the mall? [Person2]:  It's in the middle of the parking lot. [Person1]:  That's perfect. [Person2]:  I know it is.
[Person1]:  Here I raise a question for you. Just imagine we will have a foreign guest from Japan. Can you tell me how I ought to be to the most comfortable and polite? [Person2]:  Firstly, we can provide our meeting agenda before he comes. And then on the day when he is coming, we wait for him at the gate of our company's gate. [Person1]:  Well, that's right. How about on a formal occasion? What should I say to show my gratitude? [Person2]:  It's an honor and a privilege to receive a visit from such a distinguished group. [Person1]:  And then, what should we do next when you meet the guests? [Person2]:  Maybe we should send them to the reserved hotel for a short break, meanwhile we can also raise a question on what they want to have and know. [Person1]:  That sounds good, Fred!
[Person1]:  Mrs. Montgomery? I'Ve been trying to figure out when we should have the New Year's party. Could you take a book at these dates? [Person2]:  Sure. The twenty-ninth is out. I'll be out of the office all day at a seminar. Either the twenty-eighth or the thirtieth is fine. [Person1]:  Well, why don't we make it the thirtieth? We can set it up from three to five.

I need the car tonight to pick up your mother. [Person1]:  Egg! I told you about it last week! Smelly Toes is playing, and Eric asked if I would go with him! [Person2]:  Who's this Eric guy?

[Person1]:  Your dog is so much fun. He's so playful. I wish our cat enjoyed being around people as much as your dog does. [Person2]:  Cats are well know for being more independent than dogs. How old is your cat now? you'Ve had her longer than we'Ve had our dog. [Person1]:  She's eight years old. She's getting quite old. Your dog's six, isn't he? [Person2]:  Yes. He's so energetic. We take him out to the park every morning and evening. I think he'd be happy to stay there all day! [Person1]:  I'm sure he would. We usually have to drag him home. [Person2]:  Your cat spends most of the day outdoors', right? Do you kino where she goes? [Person1]:  She spends less time outdoors and she used to. we have no idea where she goes. She's very secretive. Occasionally, she brings back a dead mouse. [Person2]:  Have you ever thought about having another pet? [Person1]:  The kids want a rabbit. I don't think it would be a good idea to get a mouse or a fish! That might be too tempting for our cat!

[Person1]:  why did you lie to me in the email?  [Person2]:  I didn't lie. You just didn't ask me my real name.  [Person1]:  I should have known it was you. No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly. I thought I might have found the one for me.  [Person2]:  I'm sorry. It was cruel of me. But I promise it will never happen again? Look, there's a nice restaurant. Let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over.

[Person2]:  I'll have a diet coke, please. [Person1]:  Is this dine-in or take-out? [Person2]:  Take-out, please.
[Person1]:  Hi, I'm Cindy, the office clerk. What can I do for you? [Person2]:  Hi, I'm Henry Wilson from number 37. [Person1]:  Hi Henry. How are you? Is everything Okay in your apartment? [Person2]:  Yes. Everything is fine in the apartment. But I know nothing about this area. Could I ask you some questions? [Person1]:  Yes, please. [Person2]:  Can you tell me the postal code for this building? [Person1]:  Yes, it's L8V 4B7. [Person2]:  Thank you. Also, how can I get my mailbox key? [Person1]:  I'll tell Peter to bring your key to your apartment right away. [Person2]:  Who's Peter? [Person1]:  He's the superintendent of this building. [Person2]:  Thanks a lot. I'Ve got one more question. [Person1]:  No problem. Go ahead, please. [Person2]:  Where can I change the address on my driver's license? [Person1]:  The Department of Motor Vehicles office is at 212 Barton Street North. [Person2]:  Can you give me directions to the office? [Person1]:  We are at 2368 King Street East. [Person2]:  Yes. [Person1]:  So, it's easy to get to the office from here. From your apartment, just drive along King Street East for about one kilometer and you'll see a three-story blue building on your right. That's the Department of Motor Vehicles building where you can change your driver's license. [Person2]:  What floor is the office on? [Person1]:  It's on the first floor. [Person2]:  Thank you very much. [Person1]:  You are very welcome.
[Person1]:  Hey honey, how was your day? [Person2]:  It was alright. I ran into Bill and we got to talking for a while. He's in a bit of a jam. [Person1]:  Why? What happened? [Person2]:  Well, his son had an accident and Bill doesn't have health insurance. This really got me thinking, and I wondered if we shouldn't look into a couple of different HMO's. [Person1]:  Yeah, you're right. We aren't getting any younger and our kids are getting older. [Person2]:  Exactly! I searched on the web and found a couple of HMO's with low co-pays and good coverage. The deductibles are low, too. [Person1]:  Sounds good, although, do you think we can qualify for insurance? Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money. [Person2]:  Well, we don't have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions, so we should be fine. [Person1]:  I wish our company or country provided us with healthcare. [Person2]:  Not in a million years!
[Person1]:  May I see the manager of your office? [Person2]:  I'm afraid he's having an important meeting now. Can I help you? [Person1]:  Thank you. I am Fred, coming from Future Clothes Company. I've brought some catalogues of our new series of the summer clothes. I wonder if your manager would like to have a look at them. [Person2]:  Of course, he would. Would you leave them with me? [Person1]:  We are suppliers of the summer clothes of various styles and colors. I think you will be interested in some of our new products. We always keep the pace of the clothes fashion, so as to catch the interest of our customers. [Person2]:  We're thinking of ordering some special styles of summer clothes. We should be interested in your products if they are of the styles we want. [Person1]:  As you know, we also take orders for clothes made according to specifications. [Person2]:  How long would it take you to deliver the orders? [Person1]:  Two months at most. [Person2]:  Good. I'll send your catalogues to those who are interested. Meanwhile, may I have an indication of price? Can I have your price-sheet? [Person1]:  Yes, of course, here you are. The prices are subject to our confirmation.
[Person1]:  I think you should look over these figures again. There are some calculations that are a bit off. [Person2]:  I apologize. This should not have to be this way. [Person1]:  Apology is accepted. Try to do better next time. [Person2]:  Of course, I should have been more careful. I'm sorry.
[Person1]:  I heard that you're going back to Beijing soon. [Person2]:  That's right, and boy, I'm really busy! [Person1]:  I can imagine. But listen ... I'd love to get together with you before you go. Would you like to go out for dinner one night? [Person2]:  That's a great idea. Let's see ... on Monday night I have to study for that final exam. [Person1]:  Me, too, but I'm free on Tuesday. How about going out that night? [Person2]:  I'm afraid I can't. I'm watching a movie with Nancy at 7 [Person1]:  Are you going to the last class party on Friday night? Let's go out for dinner at 6 [Person2]:  There will be a dinner at the party. I love to eat, but I can't eat two dinners. [Person1]:  There's always Saturday night. Are you busy then? [Person2]:  No ... Saturday night I'm free. [Person1]:  I'm going to a disco with a group of friends. Do you want to join us? We can dance together. [Person2]:  I'd really like to have a quiet dinner instead. Oh! Can I call you back? Someone's at the door. [Person1]:  Sure. I'll be home all afternoon.
[Person1]:  John, you look pale. What happened?  [Person2]:  I stayed up last night.  [Person1]:  Did you have something on your mind? You look so concerned! Maybe I can help you!  [Person2]:  Well, I'm under a lot of pressure. My manager is very pushy. He assigned me two projects. Now the deadlines are near but I have finished neither of them.  [Person1]:  Is there anything I can do for you?  [Person2]:  Well, I guess no one can help me but myself. For the moment, I just need someone to talk to so that I can relieve my stress.  [Person1]:  I know your feeling. Take it easy and say something to me if you like.  [Person2]:  Oh, buddy, you are so kind. Thank you!  [Person1]:  Not at all! 
[Person1]:  Aren't you interested in watching the Olympics? There have been some excellent performances by athletes from all over the world. [Person2]:  I just don't find it very interesting. [Person1]:  I think it's wonderful to see people from all over the world taking part in such a great event. [Person2]:  I think that for a lot of people, it's just a way to try and show their country is better than other countries. [Person1]:  I think the Olympics help to promote world peace. [Person2]:  I'm not sure about that. We still have many wars in the world. I think that the idea behind the Olympics is a good one, but the reality is that during the Olympics countries compete. There's no real spirit of cooperation and people are usually not very friendly to each other. [Person1]:  You are so pessimistic! The Olympics is a great opportunity for athletes to demonstrate their speed, skill, agility and strength. Most people hope to see someone from their country win, but I think that they are just happy to see good performances by any athlete. [Person2]:  Well. I think that the most amazing performances are by athletes who participate in the Paralympics. [Person1]:  Now there we are in agreement!
[Person1]:  What do you do in your spare time? [Person2]:  I have many hobbies. I like almost all kinds of sports and I also like to listen to classical music. [Person1]:  What kinds of sports do you like? [Person2]:  I like playing basketball. Basketball is a very exciting game because it keeps you alert and I also enjoy the team spirit of basketball. [Person1]:  Who is your favorite author? [Person2]:  I like the novels of Dickens very much. I've read almost all of them in Chinese translation. [Person1]:  Are you a music lover? [Person2]:  Yes, I like listening to Beethoven's works. [Person1]:  What kinds of films do you enjoy? [Person2]:  I like all kinds as long as they are exciting.
[Person1]:  Hello. May I speak to Mary, please? [Person2]:  Speaking. Who's calling, please? [Person1]:  Hi, Mary. This is Tom. [Person2]:  Oh, hi, Tom. How've you been? [Person1]:  Just fine. I say. Aren't you busy tomorrow evening? [Person2]:  Let me see. Uh-huh. . . no, I guess I'll be free. [Person1]:  Well, uh. . . why not dine out together and go to the movies? [Person2]:  Sounds like a good idea. [Person1]:  Okay. I'll pick you up at 6 [Person2]:  Thank you for inviting me. See you then. Bye, Tom.
[Person1]:  He has so many friends supporting him. [Person2]:  And he himself is very diligent. Considering all these, I think he has the ball at his feet. [Person1]:  But he has to stick to it and to it long enough.
[Person1]:  Hi. I can't get going on my computer until I get a broadband hookup. [Person2]:  Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer, and you'll be off and running. [Person1]:  That would be okay if I had an Ethernet port. Unfortunately, my laptop uses wireless only. [Person2]:  In that case, let me tell you about some alternatives. [Person1]:  Anything to get me up and running. [Person2]:  For starters, we have a computer lab. [Person1]:  Fantastic! What do I have to pay per hour? [Person2]:  The lab is completely free. But you do have to pay a dime a page for printing. [Person1]:  That's fine. Now tell me about the other alternatives. [Person2]:  Just bring your laptop down here to the lobby. We're set up for wireless right here. [Person1]:  Great! I like that suggestion, but what if I need to print something there? [Person2]:  Unfortunately, you'll have to go to the computer lab for your printing needs.
[Person1]:  What's the news on our website? How effective do you think it is from a marketing standpoint? [Person2]:  We've been able to survey and track some of the information of our website users through some cookie technology, and it's surprising to see the results. [Person1]:  What kinds of hits are we getting on our company's website? [Person2]:  From the numbers, it seems nearly half of the visitors who stumble onto our page pick up the link not from network browsers or search engines, but from our circular insert. That means our consumers are purposefully and actively seeking information about our products and services through the web format. Based on these findings, I am completely convinced the internet is the marketing power of the future! [Person1]:  You really think that many people turn to the internet to find product information. What about the old standbys of word mouth and print media? [Person2]:  Well, these mediums are still important. . . they aren't a thing of the past. . . But I think they might be less important now than in the past. The technology age has arrived!
[Person1]:  Get up as early as six o'clock only to be jammed at every crossroad and still late for work. What a life! I've had enough of it. [Person2]:  Cool down, man. Everyone is fed up with the rush-hour traffic. But life isn't really all that. You should take the initiative and make some changes first. [Person1]:  What should I do then? [Person2]:  I recommend you ride a bike instead of commuting by bus. It may offer you many benefits. First, it's good for your health. I'm afraid it's not necessary for me to further elaborate. While lots of people spend time like an hour each morning exercising, a bike ride to work not only builds you up, but also makes full use of time. You might as well sleep out for a longer hour. [Person1]:  I know cycling is always a more favorable choice than a bus. After all, it's a sport. But do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty, polled air on the road? [Person2]:  Well, such things are just unavoidable in a great metropolis like Beijing. I think a still more desirable benefit is psychological. Bicycling home after work can help release your stress. Life in the offices is miserable. You just sit there in a daze, gazing at the monitor and dealing with files and documents. Why don't you give a full play to your energy after work? Enjoy the speed on the road. Just think, you are flashing past the poles with your own energy. How great!
[Person1]:  Oh great! This stupid computer froze again! That's the third time today! Hey Samuel, can you come take a look at my PC? It's acting again. It must have a virus or something. [Person2]:  I ran a virus scan on your computer, and it turns out that you have a lot of infected files! [Person1]:  But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing the internet, I have no idea how I could have picked a virus. [Person2]:  Well, you have to make sure that your anti-virus software is updated regularly. yours wasn't up to date, that's probably what was causing your problems. [Person1]:  Ok. Anything else? [Person2]:  Yeah, try not to kick or hit the computer! [Person1]:  Um yeah. Sorry about that.
[Person1]:  How would you like this order shipped? [Person2]:  Send it by the fastest way. [Person1]:  Are you going to ship this by air? That might cost a little more. [Person2]:  How much? [Person1]:  I'll check the costs and call you back. [Person2]:  OK.
[Person1]:  I want to buy some jewellery. [Person2]:  What kind of jewellery do you like to have? [Person1]:  I should like to look at some bracelets. [Person2]:  May I show you gold ones or platinum ones? [Person1]:  Gold ones. [Person2]:  Pure gold or carats? [Person1]:  Pure gold ones, please. This is so beautiful. I'll take it. [Person2]:  OK. [Person1]:  How much is it? [Person2]:  1336 yuan.
[Person1]:  Good afternoon, Mr. Meng! It's nice to see you today. It's been a while, hasn't it? [Person2]:  Hello, Miao Ping. Yes, it has. I've been in Saudi Arabia for the last 6 weeks on business. I did have a little time to relax in Dubai, though. [Person1]:  I envy you, Mr. Meng! What can I do for you today? [Person2]:  I need to effect a payment under my L / C. Not the old one, the new one my Assistant came in and dealt with last week. [Person1]:  Right. Do you have the code for that one? [Person2]:  It's DG193445782100. Can you find it? [Person1]:  Here it is. Have you got the advice slip with you? You have sufficient funds in the account, so we can go ahead.
[Person1]:  Hey Joe, how have you been? [Person2]:  I am doing well. How about you, Mary? [Person1]:  I am doing OK, Joe. [Person2]:  There is a new movie at the mall that I want to see. Want to go with me? [Person1]:  I can't because I already promised my roommate that I would go shopping with her. [Person2]:  I could go to the movies on Friday night instead. Would that be better? [Person1]:  Did you have a certain movie in mind? [Person2]:  I thought the movie about a serial killer who rapes and mutilates his victims would be a good choice. [Person1]:  I kind of wanted to see ' The Secret Life of Bees. ' [Person2]:  Maybe we can think of something somewhere between a chick flick and a horror movie!
[Person1]:  Madison Square Garden. Can I help you? [Person2]:  Yes. Do you have any more tickets for the concert on Friday night? [Person1]:  Do you mean the Rock'n'Roll Revival Show? Yes, we still have some $30 tickets left. [Person2]:  Great. OK, and is the box office open now? [Person1]:  Yes, the box office is open from 10 [Person2]:  Oh, by the way, what time does the show start? [Person1]:  It starts at 8 [Person2]:  And what time does it end? [Person1]:  Well, there are four bands, so it'll probably end at about midnight. [Person2]:  Thanks a lot. [Person1]:  No problem.
[Person1]:  Pardon me, officer. I want to go to Bums Park. Would you please tell me how to get there? [Person2]:  Yes, Miss. Bums Park is about half a mile from here. Do you want to take a bus or walk? The bus stop is on the other side of the street if you want to take a bus. [Person1]:  Well, I'd like to walk if it's within walking distance. [Person2]:  All right. We are now on Main Street. Go this way along, until you come to First Street. [Person1]:  I see. [Person2]:  Go straight along Main Street as far as First Street. Turn left onto First Street and walk another two blocks. Then you'll come to Lincoln Street? [Person1]:  Lincoln Street. [Person2]:  Yes, then turn right. Walk for a few minutes. Bums park begins at the comer of Lincoln and Fifth. [Person1]:  Thank you very much, officer. [Person2]:  You're welcome. Good-bye.
[Person1]:  Good morning. Is there anything I can do for you? [Person2]:  Good morning. I am looking for a pair of trousers for my son. Could I see that pair hanging in the window? [Person1]:  Sure sir. Is this the pair you meant? [Person2]:  Yes, that's it. What are these trousers made of? My son's skin is quite sensitive, so I have to be careful about the material of the clothes he wears. [Person1]:  These are made of cotton, sir. These are made by a famous children's brand called Wonder World. It's a very popular brand because of the good quality material. [Person2]:  Oh, that's good. What other colors do these trousers come in? If you have blue, that would be great. Blue is my son's favorite color. I'd rather not have black or gray. [Person1]:  Uh, these come in blue as well. Here you are, a blue pair. [Person2]:  Thank you. And one last thing, how much do the trousers cost? [Person1]:  Well, they were originally 150 yuan each, but they are now on sale 20% off. [Person2]:  That's great. I'll take them.
[Person1]:  Good afternoon, do you know where the subway station is? [Person2]:  It's down the street about 2 blocks away. [Person1]:  I've never been to this city before, so I'm not familiar with the city. Can I find it easily? [Person2]:  I think so. Just walk down the street for about 5 minutes and you'll see a sign for it right in front of a post office. Keep walking for about 10 minutes and you'll be at the subway station. So, are you here to visit friends or for business? [Person1]:  Actually, I'm with 2 friends to go sightseeing. We got separated while we were shopping in the mall, so they went to the train station and are now waiting for me there. [Person2]:  Well, I hope you have a good time here in this city. [Person1]:  Thanks.
[Person1]:  Doctor Joseph, why did you want to be a doctor? [Person2]:  Both my dad and mom were doctors and I wanted to be like them. But it all started to be more than imagination once I got to college. [Person1]:  What do you mean? [Person2]:  Well, when I was a freshman, I didn't know what I wanted to major in. So I took a health class that included an emergency first aid certificate. I figured it would be useful to know how to help someone an emergency if they needed it. [Person1]:  Sounds good. [Person2]:  Well, one night as I was walking back to my dorm. I saw a woman on the ground who had stopped breathing. I gave her mouth to mouth breathing and called 911. By the time the ambulance arrived, she had been able to breathe normally. In addition, she left the hospital the next evening. The doctor said that I had saved her life. [Person1]:  Amazing! You were a hero. [Person2]:  And that was the night that I decided to study medicine. [Person1]:  Alright. We're going to take a quick commercial break. But don't touch your remote control. Because when we come back, Doctor Joseph is going to tell us something about what he does at Johns Hopkins Hospital, including some of the scarier moments he's had as a physician. Stay tuned.
[Person1]:  May I help you? [Person2]:  Yes, I would like to exchange some money. [Person1]:  what currency would you like to trade in? [Person2]:  I would like to exchange Chinese RMB for American dollars. Do you accept $ 100 bills? [Person1]:  No problem, we can accept any denomination. How much would you like to exchange today? [Person2]:  Well, that depends on the rate. How much is the RMB trading at today? [Person1]:  It's a shame you didn't come a little earlier, the exchange rate was reset yesterday afternoon. The American dollar is now worth 7.45 RMB. It was much lower yeasterday. If you would like to sell RMB, we can give you a rate of 7.35. Will that be all right? [Person2]:  I guess, here, give me 5, 000 RMB worth please. I might as well exchange a little extra. Who knows what the exchange rate will be tomorrow!
[Person1]:  do you like animals? [Person2]:  yes, doesn't everyone? [Person1]:  what's your favorite animal? [Person2]:  it's hard to say. While dogs are more affectionate, cats are much easier to take care of. [Person1]:  have you ever had a dog? [Person2]:  when I was little, we had a few domestic dogs at home. [Person1]:  they always say that dogs are a man's best friends. do you think that's true? [Person2]:  definitely. rich or poor, dogs always love their masters. [Person1]:  how about cats? Have you ever had one for a pet? [Person2]:  i had one a few months ago, but she ended up running away. [Person1]:  how did that happen? [Person2]:  she left through a window that was open one night and never returned. [Person1]:  you must have been devastated! [Person2]:  i was pretty sad. i still hope that she'll return some day! [Person1]:  I hope she does. Do you think you'll ever get another pet? [Person2]:  I think I will. It's difficult to feel longly when you have a pet around. [Person1]:  i hope your cat finds its way back home. [Person2]:  i do, too.
[Person1]:  Hey Julie, you want to go grab something to eat? [Person2]:  Sure! What do you feel like having? [Person1]:  I really feel like having a big juicy steak! [Person2]:  Oh. OK. I don't eat meat, but that's fine, I am sure wherever we are going they will have other options right? [Person1]:  I didn't know you were a vegetarian! [Person2]:  I'm not, I am a vegan. [Person1]:  A what? [Person2]:  A vegan. I don't eat or use any animal based products. I don't wear leather, eat eggs, drink milk or anything that comes from an animal. I used to be a pescatarian before, which basically means you don't eat meat, but still have fish and seafood. [Person1]:  Wow! That's interesting! It must be tough! [Person2]:  It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes, but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays, it's getting a bit less difficult.
[Person1]:  Good morning, Madam. This is room service, may I help you? [Person2]:  Good morning. I'd like to reserve some rooms for a tourist party. [Person1]:  All right. What kind of room would you like? [Person2]:  You see, we are tourists whose requests are different, so please tell me more about it, will you? [Person1]:  It's my pleasure. We have single rooms, double rooms, suites and luxury suites, ect. Well, here is an introduction to our hotel. [Person2]:  That's great. I'd like to book four single rooms, five double rooms and three suites. [Person1]:  All right, madam. For which dates do you want to book the rooms? [Person2]:  From tomorrow till January 8th. That's five days in all. [Person1]:  I see. Now please fill out the form. [Person2]:  Here you are. Is everything OK? [Person1]:  Just a minute, madam. You should pay a deposit of 500 yuan beforehand. [Person2]:  OK. Here you are. [Person1]:  Thank you. Please keep this receipt. [Person2]:  Thank you. By the way, is there any preferential rate for the party? [Person1]:  Yes, there is a 15 percent discount. [Person2]:  That's wonderful. Thank you. [Person1]:  You're welcome. I hope all of you will have a good time here.
[Person1]:  Now that you'recommending such enormous fees, producers, directors, movie-makers must see you in a completely different light. [Person2]:  Yeah. [Person1]:  Then the standard that you set yourself originally must have changed. [Person2]:  Well, if that's the case, I don't mind breaking the image that they might have or the standards that they have. I can only do what I know, and live how I've lived all my life, because I'm a fairly stubborn person. [Person1]:  It seems to me that now you're famous. You've got to go out and be seen at the right places and go to the right parties. [Person2]:  I don't go to parties. The parties I go to are the barbecues I have in my house. Being seen in the right places is something that I don't believe in. I don't believe in going to events just for the sake I of being seen. [Person1]:  Then fans don't see you much in public places. [Person2]:  Yes. I have a very low-key life ; I have a great life. I love what I do and I love how I spend my time, which isn't in a public place. [Person1]:  A lot of people compare you to Julia Roberts. I wondered if there was anyone that you compare yourself to in Hollywood, that you've watched and thought, 'Well, they've got something I could use a little bit or could learn a little bit about. ' [Person2]:  I've never had one person that I'd idolized. The comparisons to Jul-ia Roberts are incredibly flattering. I don't really know who I would compare myself to. I'd like to be a combination of a lot of people. A little bit of everything, really. I haven't quite figured out where my strengths are yet, and I've definitely found my weaknesses.
[Person1]:  Where's Bill? The ambassador is already here. The meeting is set to start at 9 am. [Person2]:  He's late again. Traffic is probably holding him up. You know, he commutes from the suburbs. It's not easy commuting every day. We should cut him some slack. [Person1]:  Even though the traffic is bumper-to-bumper out there, I don't think it's heavy traffic that makes Bill late. He takes the train, remember? [Person2]:  Oh, that's right. Well, the train shouldn't be late. That means there is only one explanation. . . Bill must have overslept. [Person1]:  Well, to be fare, since he's coming all the way from Lancaster, he's got to get up much earlier than the rest of us. He must get start on his commute about six thirty, no telling what time he actually gets up. [Person2]:  That's right, because he's got to get to the train station from his house, then take the blue line into the city, then switch trains to the red line. In all, the trip's got to take more than 2 hours. [Person1]:  Why doesn't he just drive to work? [Person2]:  It's too difficult to park your car in the city. Also, the traffic coming in from the suburbs is a nightmare.
[Person1]:  I'm not comfortable about this, Sandy. I don't understand most of these games. [Person2]:  That's okay. I can explain a little. [Person1]:  I don't want to lose all my money. [Person2]:  Don't worry. You can't lose all your money. because you won't gamble all your money. [Person1]:  I guess you're right. [Person2]:  Of course I'm right. I already told you the rule for Las Vegas. Remember? [Person1]:  Yes, I remember. You must decide how much money you will gamble before you start to play. [Person2]:  That's right. That's the best way to have control over yourself. You say to yourself. Tonight I will gamble fifty dollars. Only fifty dollars. No more. If you follow the rule, you can't lose more than fifty dollars. [Person1]:  I know it's true, Sandy. But still some people lose control. They start to gamble, and they can't stop. [Person2]:  But I won't let you do that. I will watch you. [Person1]:  Okay. [Person2]:  So how much do you want to gamble? [Person1]:  Maybe 500 dollars. [Person2]:  500 dollars! That's too much! You just said you are afraid to lose your money. If you're afraid, why do you want to gamble 500 dollars? [Person1]:  I don't want people to think I'm stingy. [Person2]:  That is a bad attitude to have, Karen! If you think that way, Las Vegas will be really dangerous for you.
[Person1]:  Hi, Kenji. [Person2]:  Hi, Debbie. Have a seat. How's it going? [Person1]:  I'm OK. How are you doing? [Person2]:  Pretty good. Listen. . . have you heard about the new Thai restaurant over on University Avenue? [Person1]:  Do you mean The Bangkok? [Person2]:  That's the one. A bunch of us are going there for dinner tomorrow night. How about coming with us? [Person1]:  Sure, I'd love to. [Person2]:  Great. I'll call and make reservations. [Person1]:  Any time after 6 o'clock is good for me. Oh! I'm late! I have a class. [Person2]:  All right. I'll call you tonight and tell you the time. [Person1]:  Great. Talk to you then.
[Person1]:  Let's begin by having you tell me about yourself and your background. [Person2]:  I have been working as a paralegal for the last 10 months through an agency that specializes in the legal field. My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law, where I have been able to apply my paralegal education. I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts. I really love research and analyzing facts. My major in college was English, and as a result, my writing skills are my major strength. I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used. [Person1]:  What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession? [Person2]:  Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job. In my last position, I supported four lawyers, and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week. There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything. I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball. At the same time, I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda. I think communication is probably the next key quality. It really worked well when I talked with each of them, explained my situation, and got their input. [Person1]:  Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description? [Person2]:  There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week. Even though I worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks, my boss and I stayed until 2 a. m. for two nights before the final wrap up. It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results. My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort. [Person1]:  Tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome. [Person2]:  I remember a case that was filled with obstacles. The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances. I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step. I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch. Through some hard work and fact digging, I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles. I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations, which she and I discussed and eventually resolved. My boss was impressed with the work I had done. [Person1]:  What are your strengths and weaknesses? [Person2]:  My strengths are my caring about getting the job done. I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs. As far as weaknesses, I really enjoy my work, and sometimes I put in too much time. But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more. [Person1]:  Tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss. [Person2]:  I did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves. I asked her if I could talk with her one day, and we had a good discussion. It turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure. I took the time to explain the procedures, and there haven't been any problems since that day. [Person1]:  When do you find a job satisfying? [Person2]:  My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job. When I first started as a paralegal, I had a lot to learn. But through hard work, advice from some good mentors and continuing education, I have come a long way. I've learned to be flexible when possible and to deal with difficult people in a positive manner. [Person1]:  How would your coworkers describe you? [Person2]:  First, they'll say I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm. I really enjoy working with people. Secondly, they'll say I had great customer service skills. I put the customer first. And thirdly, they'll say that I know the law. I put a lot of effort into my education as a paralegal and take it seriously. [Person1]:  Do you have any questions? [Person2]:  Yes, I do. On a scale of one to 10, what would you say morale was in this company?
[Person1]:  I need to get internet. [Person2]:  Which kind of internet connection do you want to get? [Person1]:  What kind can I get? [Person2]:  There is dial-up or DEL. [Person1]:  Which one do you feel is best? [Person2]:  I would get DEL if I were you. [Person1]:  DEL is better than dial-up? [Person2]:  It's the best choice ; plus, it won't tie up your phone line. [Person1]:  I'm not sure what that means. [Person2]:  Dial-up is connected through your phone, unlike DEL. [Person1]:  That'll make it impossible for me to use. [Person2]:  Exactly. With DEL you don't have that problem.
[Person1]:  Good morning. [Person2]:  Good morning. May I help you? [Person1]:  I want to place a long-distance call to London. Is this the right counter? [Person2]:  Yes. Here's a booking form. Please write down the number you wish to call, the name of the person you want to talk to, and your own name for our reference. [Person1]:  All right. Can you tell me when I will be able to get through? [Person2]:  It's hard to say. It depends on how busy the lines are. Please take a seat over there. We'll try to put you through as soon as possible. [Person1]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  What do you feel your greatest achievement has been at your current job? [Person2]:  I think my greatest accomplishment has been acquiring the Hans account. [Person1]:  That certainly is quite an accomplishment. [Person2]:  Yes, it took a year and a lot of initiative to get that account. [Person1]:  What's your sales record been like there? [Person2]:  The last two years we have seen an increase in sales of about 30 % to 40 % each year, so I'm very pleased. And our sales projections are quite good for the next two years. [Person1]:  If things are going so well, why do you want to leave the firm now? [Person2]:  Hmm. . . I think I am ready for a new challenge. I've put a good team together at my present company, and I think If I want to take the next step in my career, it's time for me to move on.
[Person1]:  How do you like your job here, Linda?  [Person2]:  It's interesting, I like being an editor.  [Person1]:  Why?  [Person2]:  I like talking to writers, I get to meet a lot of interesting people.  [Person1]:  I'm happy to hear that, but publishing is more than just talking to writers. it involves a lot of work, patience and responsibility. Most of the work is boring.  [Person2]:  I don't feel bored at all. I'm getting along with my collegues. I will enjoy working with them. People are great in this industry.  [Person1]:  Do you have any complaints?  [Person2]:  No, I have no complaints. I hear there are many opportunities to move up in this company. is that true?  [Person1]:  Yes, you have many opportunities to grow in this company as long as you do well.  [Person2]:  That's perfect. I will definitely do well. 
[Person1]:  Hey, Zina. You're here early today.  [Person2]:  Yeah, I'm going to be making phone calls all day. What a blast.  [Person1]:  I just wanted to say thanks for putting us on the map so fast. I appreciate it.  [Person2]:  Save it, Vince. After I put my first million in the bank, I'll say you're welcome.  [Person1]:  Fair enough. Keep up the good work. 
[Person1]:  Welcome to our shop. It seems you are interested in this dress. [Person2]:  Yes. But I am afraid it is too thick to wear in summer. [Person1]:  That's no problem. It is made of linen, so you won't feel hot in it. I can assure you it is of superior quality. What is more, it is very popular with young women. [Person2]:  How much is it? [Person1]:  88 Yuan. [Person2]:  OK, that is reasonable. I will take it.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, sir. Can you tell me where I can buy some chocolates?  [Person2]:  Two rows up on the right. We have various kinds of chocolates.  [Person1]:  Thank you. How much is this kind of chocolate?  [Person2]:  $10 a kilo. 
[Person1]:  Well, tell me something of yourself.  [Person2]:  What would you like to know, Mr. Green?  [Person1]:  What working experience have you get?  [Person2]:  In 2004, I got a job in the sales department of a trading company near Guangzhou. I started a sales rpresentative. A year later, I was promoted to the position of sales manager. I had that job ever since, which is just over a year now.  [Person1]:  Oh, good. Irene, can you tell me why you plan to quit being a sales manager to work here as my assistant? Don't you like your present job?  [Person2]:  Frankly, some part of it I enjoy very much, but I prefer something more professional. It happens that I have a friend working here in this company. She told me the export department was to recruit an assistant. I felt very excited at this news. That's why I'm here. 
[Person1]:  So Dick, how about getting some coffee for tonight? [Person2]:  Coffee? I don ' t honestly like that kind of stuff. [Person1]:  Come on, you can at least try a little, besides your cigarette. [Person2]:  What ' s wrong with that? Cigarette is the thing I go crazy for. [Person1]:  Not for me, Dick.
[Person1]:  Excuse me. [Person2]:  Yes? How can I help you? [Person1]:  Are these drinks on sale this weekend? [Person2]:  Yes. [Person1]:  Can I buy more than one case? [Person2]:  Yes.

[Person1]:  I left a suitcase on the train to London the other day. [Person2]:  Can you describe it, sir? [Person1]:  It's a small blue case and it's got a zip. There's a label on the handle with my name and address on it. [Person2]:  Is this case yours? [Person1]:  No, that's not mine. [Person2]:  What about this one? This one's got a label. [Person1]:  Let me see it. [Person2]:  What's you name and address? [Person1]:  David Hall, 83, Bridge Street. [Person2]:  That's right. D. N. Hall. 83. Bridge Street. Three pound and fifty pence please. [Person1]:  Here you are. [Person2]:  Thank you. [Person1]:  Hey! [Person2]:  What's the matter? [Person1]:  This case doesn't belong to me! You've given me the wrong case!
[Person1]:  What's the difference between football and rugby? [Person2]:  Those tow games are quite different. First, there's the size of the teams. In football, a team has 11 players. In rugby there are 15 players on each team. The biggest difference is that in football, only the goalkeeper can use his hands. In rugby, the ball is usually carried forward by players, though kicking is permitted. [Person1]:  In rugby, players pass the ball by throwing it to team mates, don't they? [Person2]:  That's right. However, players can only pass the ball backwards. They cannot pass the ball forwards to their team mates. That's a foul. [Person1]:  I know how goals are scored in football, but how about in rugby? [Person2]:  If a team carries the ball over the goal line, they score points. A team can also score points by kicking the ball between two tall posts at each end of the pitch. [Person1]:  There's a lot more physical contact in rugby, isn't there? [Person2]:  Yes. Players usually need to bring a player down to stop him from moving forward with the ball. This is called ' tackling ', as in football. [Person1]:  The ball is a different shape in rugby, isn't it? [Person2]:  Yes. It's not perfectly round like a football. A rugby ball is oval in shape. There's a match on TV this afternoon. Why don't you watch it with me? I'll try to explain the rules and tactics while we're watching. [Person1]:  Ok.
[Person1]:  Would you like a cigarette? [Person2]:  No, thanks. I've decided to give up smoking. [Person1]:  Really? Why? [Person2]:  Well, it's just that I think if you don't enjoy doing something any more, you should stop doing it. [Person1]:  I see. You mean you don't enjoy smoking any more? [Person2]:  That's right. You should give it up, too. It's bad for your health. [Person1]:  Stop talking like my mother. That's what she keeps saying. [Person2]:  But it's true. It's a nasty habit. I can't think why I ever started. Anyway, it's obviously got you in its grip! [Person1]:  What do you mean? What are you talking about? [Person2]:  I mean you couldn't give it up! [Person1]:  Who? Me? Could't give up smoking? Nonsense! Of course I could! I know I could! [Person2]:  How do you know? [Person1]:  Because I've already proved it. Smoking's the easiest thing in the world to give up. I've done it hundreds of times!
[Person1]:  Have you heard about Anlesen David? [Person2]:  No, have they have another fight? [Person1]:  No, they got engaged. [Person2]:  You must be joking. Those two? [Person1]:  Well, my dear. I didn't believe either. But got it straight form the horse's mouth. David called me this morning. [Person2]:  So when did all this happen? [Person1]:  Last weekend, while they were on the Sik trip. [Person2]:  Well, I believe it now, and when are they are getting married? [Person1]:  Next June. [Person2]:  I can hardly believe it.
[Person1]:  Can I get you something to drink? [Person2]:  No, that's okay, I already have a coke. Why don't you have a seat, you look like you've been on your feet all day. [Person1]:  I guess I could take a break. So, how do you like Denver? [Person2]:  It's great! The mountains here are beautiful and the skiing is spectacular. Have you been here for a long time? [Person1]:  About six years. . . [Person2]:  What do you do for a living? [Person1]:  I manage one of the ski lodges. It's a great job, I can spend a lot of my time outdoors, and I also get to ski for free all season. [Person2]:  Wow, talk about job perks! That's great. I would like to do something exciting like that. But I am only an accountant. Not too much excitement there. huh? [Person1]:  That's okay. If it weren't for you accountants, nobody would have the money to go skiing!
[Person1]:  I really like the apartment, but I was wondering if I could change some things. [Person2]:  What would you like to change? [Person1]:  I would like to have different carpet. [Person2]:  I would be willing to put in a different color carpet if you pay the price difference. [Person1]:  How much more would it cost? [Person2]:  It would cost between 2 and 10 dollars more per square yard. [Person1]:  While I am at it, would it be possible to switch paint colors? [Person2]:  I would be willing to look at a different color. You need to bring me a sample. [Person1]:  When can my apartment be painted and ready to go? [Person2]:  You can have the new carpet and paint by next Monday.
[Person1]:  Did you like the Chanel bag that I got? [Person2]:  You must have a rich boyfriend because that bag is so expensive! [Person1]:  I bought it on eBay. It was only one-tenth of the original price. And the purchase was so easy. [Person2]:  No kidding! Then how do you know the bag's real? [Person1]:  Well, it came with a certificate, and it looks real. But auctioning on eBay is risky. [Person2]:  A risk I would never take. . . [Person1]:  Then you haven't browsed eBay before. . . get online. Don't hang up!
[Person1]:  Hi! I need to request a wake-up call for tomorrow morning. [Person2]:  What time do you want the call? [Person1]:  I need two calls, one at 7 and another at 7 fifteen. [Person2]:  We can certainly do that. Expect a call from us at 7 o'colock and then again at 7 fifteen. [Person1]:  Actually, can I change the latter wake-up call to 7 thirty. am? [Person2]:  I can certainly do that. Is there anything else? [Person1]:  I can't think of anything. If I do think of something, I'll be sure to call again. [Person2]:  Okay. Good night, sir.
[Person1]:  For me, now an important question to buy an Accord is the time when I can get this car. I need a new car rather soon. [Person2]:  Well, I can say that the new models will be here in August. If you order one now, we will have it for you in August. [Person1]:  That's good enough, I think. What colors does the new Accord come in? [Person2]:  We have this new model in red, white, black, or silver. These are the standard colors. Of course you could specially order from various other colors too. [Person1]:  My brother has last year's Accord. And his car is a kind of soft purple color mixed with silver. I really like that color. I wonder if I can get that color on my Accord. [Person2]:  I know the color you mean. Is this it, sir? [Person1]:  Yes, I think that's it. Can I get that on the Accord? [Person2]:  Yes, you can. That color is very popular with Honda buyers. So we've kept it available. [Person1]:  Well, I think I want to order the new Accord then. It looks like an excellent car. [Person2]:  You have made a good choice, sir. I drive an Accord myself. They are very solidly built machines, very reliable. [Person1]:  Yes, I know. I think Honda is the most reliable car on the road. I would never change to anything else. The Honda I have now almost never has service problems. It runs smooth as silk. [Person2]:  Alright, sir. I will get the paperwork ready for you. Just a moment.

Computer ... (BEEP BEEP). Locate Captain Duroset. [Person4]:  Captain Melony Duroset is not aboard this ship. [Person6]:  Mr. Greenfield, Mr. Ruto, you have the bridge and inform me if anything happens. Mortia to all decks. Please report to the cargo bay 3. [Person1]:  A few minutes later, Commander Mortia has taken charge and is briefing crew members in cargo bay 3. [Person6]:  As many of you are aware, twenty crew members have disappeared from the ship. Our sensors have detected a spatial flux. We're not sure if our members are being randomly transported off the ship or if they are being targeted.

[Person1]:  Professor, excuse me, but I need to leave early. [Person2]:  What seems to be the problem? [Person1]:  I am not feeling well. [Person2]:  What is bothering you? [Person1]:  I think I am beginning to have an asthma attack. [Person2]:  Would you like someone to walk you over to the Student Health Center? [Person1]:  No, I think that I should just go home because I have some medicine there. [Person2]:  Do you need a ride home? [Person1]:  I live in the dorms across the street, so I'll be OK. [Person2]:  OK, then, hope you feel better soon. Check your e-mail for missed assignments.
[Person1]:  How do you get paid? If you don't mind my asking.  [Person2]:  Not cash. But if our launch goes well, my stock options will pay off, big time.  [Person1]:  And in the meantime, how do you pay the rent?  [Person2]:  I don't have to worry about rent. I live right here.  [Person1]:  What? In your cubicle?  [Person2]:  Right here. Me and my PC. Home sweet home. 
[Person1]:  Pardon me. I need an old music box.  [Person2]:  Exactly how old a box do you want?  [Person1]:  Actually, I was thinking about something from the 1920s.  [Person2]:  We still have six left.  [Person1]:  Do any of the boxes have dancing figures?  [Person2]:  Dancing figures are quite popular. Two of the boxes have them.  [Person1]:  I love the dancing figures. I'll take this music box.  [Person2]:  Yes, I think you'll be very satisfied with that one.  [Person1]:  I was wondering, does this come with any kind of warranty?  [Person2]:  No. But if something goes wrong with it, I know someone who repairs these things.  [Person1]:  I was just hoping.  [Person2]:  It's amazing that these things still work as well as they do. 
[Person1]:  What's the date today Mr. Brown? I don't have a calendar.  [Person2]:  Today is Tuesday, 25th September, 2001.  [Person1]:  25th Sep? Oh, I have an appointment tonight.  [Person2]:  What time is your appointment?  [Person1]:  It is at 8 o'clock .  [Person2]:  What time is now? Do you have the correct time?  [Person1]:  I don't know what time it is.  [Person2]:  It must be about 6 o'clock.  [Person1]:  I have to go now. I don't want to be late.  [Person2]:  You won't be late. It's still early. 
[Person1]:  Are you going to watch the Indy Five Hundred on TV this weekend? [Person2]:  I'm not really into race car driving. [Person1]:  You were when we were in high school. That, and baseball. [Person2]:  Yeah, well, times change. Look at you! You're a father of three kids now. You can't say that you haven't changed any. [Person1]:  True, but I still have to watch my baseball. The season's in full swing now. [Person2]:  I mean, I know spring training's over, but I'm just not into all that. [Person1]:  Hello? Is the real Taylor in there?
[Person1]:  Hello, could I speak to Selina, please? [Person2]:  Speaking. Is that you, Tom? What's wrong with your voice? I hardly recognize your voice. [Person1]:  I practice singing last night. I guess I practiced too hard. You know, it lasted from 7 [Person2]:  You must have hurt your voice. So what can I do for you? [Person1]:  Well, Bob and his girlfriend have returned from China. Jenny and I invited them to come over and have dinner with us tonight. I've just opened the box of glasses and there is one missing. Then I remembered my son broke one about 2 months ago. I remember we bought the glasses together and you bought the same set of glasses. So can I borrow a glass from you? [Person2]:  Sure. When do you need them? [Person1]:  Dinner begins at 6 o'clock, but Bob and his girlfriend will come over by 5 [Person2]:  I see. I'll leave for the supermarket in about half an hour. I'll take the glass to your place. I guess you'll receive it by 5 o'clock. [Person1]:  That'd be great. Thank you, Selina. [Person2]:  You are quite welcome.
[Person1]:  How may I help you? [Person2]:  Hi, I would like to rent a car. [Person1]:  Sure, did you make a reservation? [Person2]:  No, I decided to rent one when I got off the plane just now, is that OK? [Person1]:  Of course. I was just checking, so how many days do you need the car for? [Person2]:  Can I just do 4 days for now and make the rent longer through a phone call later? [Person1]:  In that case, I suggest you go for 7 days, which will give you a 20% discount and if you choose to return the car after 5 days, you can get the rest of your money back. [Person2]:  OK, I will do that. Can I return the car at the train station? [Person1]:  Yes, you can.
[Person1]:  Larry, it's great to see you. How are you? [Person2]:  I'm great. I just came back from vacation with Martha's family. [Person1]:  Where did you go? [Person2]:  Well, her parents were celebrating their thirtieth wedding anniversary. So they paid for all of us to go to Spain. [Person1]:  That's awesome. How many People went? [Person2]:  There were 12 adults, and 6 kids. [Person1]:  Wow, if you put more than 4 members of my family together, it would be a disaster. [Person2]:  Mine, too. But my wife's family is wealthy enough to make sure everyone gets a lot of space. They rented a farm. And Martha and I had our own cottage. So we played with the kids during the day. But it was easy to get privacy when we wanted it. That's very necessary on family trips. [Person1]:  I agree. So what did you do on this farm? [Person2]:  We cooked and ate together. We went swimming and we played games. But we also took day trips in the car. [Person1]:  I would be scared to drive around a foreign country. [Person2]:  It wasn't so bad. We were only about 45 minutes from Sevilla and an hour from Cordoba. We went to Madrid, too. But that was 4 hours away. [Person1]:  Did anyone have problems driving? [Person2]:  No, everything went surprisingly well and we were able to just have a good time. Now that I'm back home, I just feel really grateful for that.
[Person1]:  How do you think they could be ended? [Person2]:  I don't think that there is any easy way. The United Nations could send peacekeepers into the country. At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate. [Person1]:  So, if the cause is poverty, there should be a program to make the country richer. If the problem is resources, share them. [Person2]:  It sounds easy when you say it like that. In reality, it's harder to make peace between countries. [Person1]:  Yes, it is. One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support. Wars are very expensive.
[Person1]:  Shall we have some soup first? [Person2]:  No, thank you. I don't like soup. I'd rather have some fruit juice to start with. [Person1]:  Ok, and what about the main course? Which would you rather have fish or meat? [Person2]:  Meat, I think. [Person1]:  Don't you like fish then? [Person2]:  I do, but I want meat. [Person1]:  Shall we have some white wine then? [Person2]:  Yes, but I prefer red wine with meat. [Person1]:  What would you like for dessert? [Person2]:  I just want to have a coffee, I think.
[Person1]:  Have you packed our passports? [Person2]:  Not yet. Do we need to take it with us? [Person1]:  Of course. Otherwise I cannot go abroad. [Person2]:  Is that hard to get a passport? [Person1]:  Not at all. But we do need to keep it with us all the time. [Person2]:  It is hard to believe this little thing is so valuable to us.
[Person1]:  Are you going somewhere? [Person2]:  Yes, I'm off to the department store. I must buy some furniture for my new flat. [Person1]:  Really? Well you'll have to get there before 6pm because they close early today. [Person2]:  Ok. Thanks for that information. [Person1]:  Yeah and remember if you buy something you mustn't carry it home otherwise your back will get worse. [Person2]:  Ok, do they have a delivery service? [Person1]:  Yes, but it's not free, you have to pay. [Person2]:  Ok, I'll see you later.
[Person1]:  Doctor, is it easy to see death? [Person2]:  Well, it seems it's not so easy for me to tell you about death. [Person1]:  Tell me the fact, please. I'm not afraid. [Person2]:  OK. I guess you're on the way to see death. [Person1]:  I believe you're right. But I want to have a long life. Help me, please. [Person2]:  OK. Listen. It looks as if you have too much money. [Person1]:  Oh? [Person2]:  It seems that the more money you have, the worse your health is. You must have worried too much about the safety of your money. [Person1]:  Yes, that's quite true. [Person2]:  Why not give some money to poor people? [Person1]:  No way!Money is my life.
[Person1]:  I'd like to see you off, Jane, but I can't get to the airport until five o'clock. [Person2]:  I'm afraid I'll have left by then. My plane takes off at 4 [Person1]:  What a pity! You're going straight to Washington, aren't you? [Person2]:  No, I'm staying with my sister in New York. She isn't there at the moment but she'll have arrived by Monday morning. I'll spend a couple of weeks with her and then go to Washington. Classes will already have started by then. [Person1]:  Well, I wish you luck.
[Person1]:  It's lucky that we rode our bike here instead of driving. [Person2]:  It's a good job that we got here early. Look at all those cars there. They'll never get in. [Person1]:  You'd better follow me closely. I don't want to lose you. [Person2]:  Don't worry. I'll keep up. [Person1]:  We go in over there. Gate B. Peter said they're pretty good tickets. [Person2]:  Where are they? [Person1]:  They're right behind the goal. [Person2]:  Oh,do we have to stand up all the time? [Person1]:  That's right. [Person2]:  I hope we can see the match clearly. [Person1]:  That's why we've come early. The earlier, the better.
[Person1]:  Gosh! Have you seen this, Richard? [Person2]:  See what? [Person1]:  In the paper. It says, there is a man going around pretending he's from the electricity board. He's been calling at people's homes, saying he is coming to check that all their appliances are safe. Then he gets around them to make him a cup of tea, and while they are out of the room he steals their money, handbag whatever and makes off with it. [Person2]:  But you know, Jane, it's partly their own fault. You should never let anyone like that in unless you're expecting them. [Person1]:  It's all very well to say that. But someone comes to the door, and says electricity or gas and you automatically think they are OK, especially if they flash a card to you [Person2]:  Does this man have an ID then? [Person1]:  Yes, that's just it. It seems he used to work for the electricity board at one time. According to the paper the police are warning people especially pensioners not to admit anyone unless they have an appointment. It's a bit sad. One old lady told them she'd just been to the post, office to draw her pension when he called. She said he must have followed her home. He stole the whole lot. [Person2]:  But what does he look like? Surely they must have a description. [Person1]:  Oh, yes they have. Let's see, in his thirties, tall, bushy dark hair, slight northern accent, sounds a bit like you actually.
[Person1]:  What's the best way to downtown? [Person2]:  If you're in a hurry, you should take a taxi. But it's kind of expensive. [Person1]:  I'm in no particular hurry. [Person2]:  Well, in that case, take an airport bus then. It will cost you only about $5. [Person1]:  That cannot be a better idea.
[Person1]:  Good afternoon, here is the dress you want to be made. [Person2]:  But I don't think it's what I asked for. [Person1]:  What's wrong with it, the color, the style or the size? [Person2]:  No, it's not the fight material. I can't possibly accept it. [Person1]:  That is a pity.
[Person1]:  The portions here are man sized. We usually end up taking half of the meal home with us. [Person2]:  Everything looks so good. Is there anything in particular that you recommend? [Person1]:  Hey, sis. You know me, if I don't like everything on the menu, I don't go back to the restaurant! [Person2]:  So you're saying I can't go wrong with anything I order? In that case. . . [Person1]:  Wait, you love salmon, don't you? They have the best salmon pasta. [Person2]:  That sounds really good! Does it come with a soup? [Person1]:  Soup and bread and salad bar! I'm telling you, these people know how to keep you coming back! [Person2]:  I see what you mean!
[Person1]:  They should be a great show. Let's go in. [Person2]:  Sure. Say, did you bring my book? [Person1]:  Oh, I completely forgot it. [Person2]:  You forgot? But you promised. I needed to study for the test. Oh, I knew I never should have lent it to you. [Person1]:  Calm down, Melber. After the show, we can drive by my house and pick it up. [Person2]:  It's pretty far out of the way. But I guess we'll have to. [Person1]:  Don't worry. I'll treat you to an ice cream to make it up to you. [Person2]:  OK.
[Person1]:  The film starts at 7 [Person2]:  6 [Person1]:  Ok, I'll see you later.
[Person1]:  I have found that Chinese people really enjoy drinking tea. [Person2]:  Yeah, tea is an important part of Chinese culture. [Person1]:  I know there are many kinds of tea, such as Longjing Tea, Biluochun Tea and Oolong Tea. [Person2]:  Yeah, Qimen Black Tea, Huangshan Maofeng Tea, and Jasmine Tea are also very famous. [Person1]:  How are they different from each other? [Person2]:  They taste different, because they're made differently. Black tea is heavy but green tea is light.
[Person1]:  We are doing Secret Santa at the office again this year. [Person2]:  Whose name did you pick? [Person1]:  I got Jacob. Any ideas what to get him? [Person2]:  Booze! [Person1]:  Yeah, you ' re right. Can ' t go wrong with that.
[Person1]:  Hilton hotel, may I help you? [Person2]:  We would like to book a table for 6 at 7 [Person1]:  OK, sir. We will arrange one for you. [Person2]:  Can we bring drinks by ourselves? [Person1]:  Sorry, sir. It's not allowed in our hotel. [Person2]:  All right. Thank you.
[Person1]:  Didn't you write a paper about Albert Kahn last semester? [Person2]:  Yes, for my history of architecture class. [Person1]:  Oh, I am taking it now and I have to do some research on industrial architecture. I need to read up on Kahn's factories. So I would like to see what you wrote about them. [Person2]:  I don't think my paper will help; I focus on his classical design like Clements library and office buildings, but you are interested in the modern building he is famous for. [Person1]:  Yes he is best known for his factory, especially the auto plants in Detroit. He made a breakthrough in industrial design. You know before his time, factories were so cmp3ped and inefficient but his factory provide enough light and air and open space. So the cars could be assembled in one huge plant. [Person2]:  I remember reading that previously, factories had wooden frame and the heavy machinery made the buildings vibrate and there were fire hazards too. But when Kahn started to design auto plants around the turn of the century, reinforced concrete had just been invented. Talk about the breakthrough, not only were the buildings sturdy and fireproof but they were cheap to put up too! [Person1]:  You seem to know a lot of about his industrial career. [Person2]:  Actually even though I wrote about his other works, I did a lot of background reading. Let me see if I can dig up that paper for you. There were some books of articles included in my bibliography that you might want to look up at the library.
[Person1]:  Have you worked out the offers. Mr. Thou? [Person2]:  Yes, we have. Here's our CIF quotation sheet. Please have a careful look. [Person1]:  Are the prices on the list firm offers? [Person2]:  Yes. All the quotations on the list are subject to our final confirmation. [Person1]:  I wonder whether there are any changes in your prices. [Person2]:  All these products are our best-selling lines. The prices of our products will change according to that of the international market demand. And we are always open to negotiate, especially on larger orders. What do you have in mind? [Person1]:  How long does your offer remain valid? I need some time to get my supervisors on board with this plan. [Person2]:  I understand. Our offer remains open for 4 days.
[Person1]:  What can I do for you today? [Person2]:  I would like to use a computer. [Person1]:  Do you have your library card? [Person2]:  I sure do. [Person1]:  There is a wait for the computers. [Person2]:  That ' s all right. [Person1]:  You need to print your name on this list. [Person2]:  Okay. Now what? [Person1]:  Once a computer is available, I will let you know. [Person2]:  How am I supposed to log on to the computer? [Person1]:  All you do is type in the number on the back of your card. [Person2]:  That ' s it? Thank you very much.
[Person1]:  Could you tell me something about the Mid-Autumn Festival? I find it also very interesting. [Person2]:  OK. It falls on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month. It is said that there is a beautiful goddess Chang'E on the moon who had eaten some sort of elixir and had to depart her husband. She is always expecting to see her husband again. So, later we have the traditional idea that when there is the full moon, it is time for the family members to come together. [Person1]:  So, I understand why people eat moon cakes on that day. [Person2]:  You are right. In China, 'round'is an auspicious word. The moon cakes are in round shape. [Person1]:  Is it official? [Person2]:  It was not in the past. But from 2008, we can enjoy a three-day holiday for this festival.
[Person1]:  Any plans tonight? [Person2]:  Not really, do you? [Person1]:  Well, I am wondering if we took a hang-out for a drink or something. You know, I just came back from a really tough interview. I was quite nervous during the interview. I really want to have the job. Right now, I am still a little on the edge. I am not sure if I could convince them during the interview. [Person2]:  Take it easy. It is all over now. How was it going, anyway? [Person1]:  I don't know. I think I did well in the paper exams. I was prepared to answer a lot of questions, but they didn't ask those as I expected. To my surprise, the manager tried to talk about the Chinese poesy with me. [Person2]:  That's strange. But probably, it is the new interview technique they call it'Getting to know you more personally'. What about your answers? [Person1]:  Just did my best.
[Person1]:  What's going on here? [Person2]:  You mean, what's happening? Well, constable, I'm trying to get out of the windowand Fred here is helping me. [Person1]:  Why are you climbing through the window and not leaving by the front door? [Person2]:  Well, you see I can't find the key and I'm in a hurry. Come on, Fred, We're wasting time. [Person1]:  Just a minute you two. I don't think you're telling me the truth. This isn't poorhouse, is it? [Person2]:  No, it's my brother's. I'm staying with him for a while. [Person1]:  Is he at home? [Person2]:  I'm afraid not. He's in jail for house-breaking at the moment.
[Person1]:  Let me see your passport, please. [Person2]:  Oh, here you are. [Person1]:  You come from Germany, don't you? [Person2]:  Yes. And come here for tourism. [Person1]:  How long will you be staying in China? [Person2]:  Twenty days. [Person1]:  OK. Have you filled in the Declaration Form? [Person2]:  Yes, here is the form. [Person1]:  Is this your luggage? [Person2]:  Yes, only one travel bag. [Person1]:  What do you have in the luggage? [Person2]:  Nothing but several personal effects. [Person1]:  That's all. Thank you for your co-operation.
[Person1]:  Hello, I'd like to see Mr. Charles, the manager, please. [Person2]:  You don't make any prior appointment, do you? [Person1]:  No. I haven't, but I'll take only a few minutes of his time. [Person2]:  Please tell your name, company and the nature of your business. [Person1]:  Yes. My name is Lin Tao, the director of Guangzhou Computer Corporation. [Person2]:  I see. Wait a minute, please. [Person1]:  Okay, sure thing. I will wait just here, thank you. [Person2]:  Mr. Lin, Mr. Charles can see you now. This way, please.
[Person1]:  Operator, connect me with the cashier please. Miss, I want to check out. Will you please have the bill ready for me? I'll come down in a few minutes. [Person2]:  OK. Sir, I'll bill you right away. [Person1]:  Operator, sorry to bother you again. Will you please send me a porter to carry my luggage downstairs?
[Person1]:  Are there any special unemployment forms I need to fill out? [Person2]:  You need to get a special application form. [Person1]:  Do you know where I can find the application form? [Person2]:  You can go to the Employment Development Office and pick it up. [Person1]:  What records will I have to show to apply for unemployment benefits? [Person2]:  They will need a record showing who you worked for and when you worked for them. [Person1]:  Is there anything else I will need to provide? [Person2]:  Be prepared to show a written notice of your termination as proof. [Person1]:  Do I need to do anything else after I turn in the application? [Person2]:  You will receive a notice for a phone interview, which will continue the process.
[Person1]:  I am glad to have the opportunity of visiting your corporation. I hope we can do business together. [Person2]:  It's a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. White. I believe you have seen our exhibits in the showroom. What is it that particularly interests you? [Person1]:  I am interested in your hardware. I've seen the exhibits and studied your catalogues. I think some of the items will find a ready market in France. Here is a list of requirements. [Person2]:  Thank you for your inquiry. Would you tell us what quantity you require so that we can work out the offer? [Person1]:  I will do that. Meanwhile, could you give me an indication of the price. [Person2]:  Here are our FOB price lists. All the prices in the lists are subject to our confirmation. [Person1]:  What about the commission? From European suppliers, I usually get a 3 to 5 % commission for my imports. It's the general practice. [Person2]:  As a rule we don't allow any commission. But if the order is sizable one, we will consider it. [Person1]:  You see I do business on a commission basis. A commission on your prices would make it easier for me to promote sales. Even 2 or 3 % would help. [Person2]:  We'll discuss this when you place your order with us.
[Person1]:  I am sure you've noticed a lot of things that are different about our school. [Person2]:  Oh, yes. In the United States, we don't have to carry a big school bag with us like you do. [Person1]:  Why is that? [Person2]:  We have a locker of our own, which is a small box with a lock. We keep textbooks and our personal things in it. I just bring a day-pack to school. [Person1]:  A day-pack? [Person2]:  Yes. It's a small bag that you carry on your back. [Person1]:  What do you carry in it? [Person2]:  My notebooks or a few books for homework. [Person1]:  That's convenient. Is there anything else you've noticed about our school? [Person2]:  Yes. I am surprised that everyone is so silent in class. [Person1]:  What do you mean? [Person2]:  Well, we usually ask questions about exams, homework or textbooks on the first day of the school year. The teacher likes such questions. [Person1]:  So you felt it different. [Person2]:  Yes. I expected to see a lot of discussions in class, because we learn in that way in the United States. [Person1]:  I see. That would be a good topic for our school newspaper for the first month of the term. Nice talking with you. See you around. Bye. [Person2]:  Bye.
[Person1]:  Hey. What's this on Facebook? It says ... Are you getting married? [Person2]:  Yeah. Didn't you know that? [Person1]:  No. Why didn't you tell me about it? It says you're getting married next week. [Person2]:  Yeah, and I'm bringing her over to mom's house tomorrow. You'll love Jasmine. [Person1]:  Jasmine? [Person2]:  Yeah. Here's her picture on Facebook. [Person1]:  Oh. Wow. [Person2]:  What? What do you mean? [Person1]:  Dad is not going to be impressed. [Person2]:  Why? [Person1]:  She's got, like a lot her tattoos and a nose ring, and uh, I'm sorry. The family is going to be really surprised. [Person2]:  Ah, she's so, well, so sensitive and caring. [Person1]:  Um, well ....  [Person2]:  What? [Person1]:  Have ... have you taken any marriage prep classes? [Person2]:  Ah, who needs that anyway? I know all about women. [Person1]:  Yeah. Right, like .... What have you had? Like ten girlfriends in the last six months? [Person2]:  Well, that's different! [Person1]:  Uh, listen. Obviously, you need to improve your communication skills, and the best thing at this point .... if you're really set on marrying Jamie... [Person2]:  Jasmine ... [Person1]:  Okay, I'm sorry, Jasmine, anyway, um, you really should take a marriage prep class. [Person2]:  What? What you are talking about? I know all about love and romance. [Person1]:  Uh. Right .... [Person2]:  What? What do you mean? [Person1]:  Look. Okay. It's more than that. What do you know about, say, personal finance? [Person2]:  Well, you know ... [Person1]:   I mean, how are you going to manage your money together? Are you going to have a joint bank account? Whose salary is going to pay the bills? [Person2]:  Ah, no problem. No problem. We have that figured out. My paycheck is going to be automatically transfered to her overseas bank account. [Person1]:  Oh.  [Person2]:  What? [Person1]:  Uh, where exactly is this account? What's the name of the bank? [Person2]:  Ah, I don't know. Jasmine's going to take care of that. [Person1]:  Oh, boy. Right. Um, well, what about children? Are you guys going to have any kids? [Person2]:  Well, I want a large family, so eight kids would be just about right. [Person1]:  Wow! What does Jasmine say about that? [Person2]:  Ah, well, she doesn't want any kids, but I'll change her mind once we get married. [Person1]:  Right.  [Person2]:  No problem. [Person1]:  Okay, what about housework? How are you going to handle that? [Person2]:  Well, Jasmine won't mind doing it. [Person1]:  Did she said that? [Person2]:  Well, not exactly. We've been just so busy planning out our honeymoon, that we just haven't worked out, you know, these small details. [Person1]:  Great! You know what? By the time you learn her last name, I think things are going to be over between the two of you. [Person2]:  No, you just want and see.
[Person1]:  Well, Jenny, the school year is almost over. We just have two more weeks before exams. What do you plan to do this summer? [Person2]:  I'm going to teach English to some immigrants in the university's community service program. [Person1]:  That sounds interesting. Don't you need to speak a foreign language for a job like that? [Person2]:  No, you don't. You just have to present the language simply and give the students a chance to practice speaking. [Person1]:  Come to think of it, that's the way I was taught to speak Chinese. But speaking didn't help me learn to read and write Chinese. [Person2]:  My students won't want to read and write English, at lease not now. They are more interested in speaking. [Person1]:  You sound very knowledgeable about all this. How do you know so much? [Person2]:  I took a Teaching English as a Second Language course last year when you were in China. I've also talked with the experienced teachers quite a lot. I think I would like to be an ESL teacher when I graduate.
[Person1]:  Hi. Can I help you with something?  [Person2]:  Yes, please. We're looking for the men's department.  [Person1]:  It's right over there, by the escalator.  [Person3]:  Here we are . . . and here are the sport shirts.  [Person2]:  Look at this one. The color is perfect for you!  [Person3]:  I like it, too. How much is it?  [Person2]:  It's on sale for $19. 98.  [Person3]:  That's a good price. But I think they only have it in large.  [Person2]:  Excuse me! Could you help me?  [Person1]:  Sure. What can I do for you?  [Person2]:  Does this shirt come in medium?  [Person1]:  Yes, it does. Here's a medium.  [Person3]:  Great. We'll take it.  [Person1]:  Will that be cash or charge? 
[Person1]:  Here are the menu and wine list.  [Person2]:  What would you like to drink? Mr. Ford?  [Person3]:  I'd like to try German Beer.  [Person2]:  Bring us two bottles of the German Beer.  [Person1]:  OK, sir. What about something to eat?  [Person2]:  What's the special food in this restaurant?  [Person1]:  We have special beef steak, pork, chicken and fish.  [Person3]:  I like beef steak.  [Person2]:  Make it two.  [Person1]:  How would you like to have it, rare, medium or over done?  [Person2]:  I want it medium.  [Person3]:  Me, too. 
[Person1]:  Are you looking at some funny pictures? You've been laughing all this time. [Person2]:  I was watching a video on YouTube. It was really funny. [Person1]:  What's it about? [Person2]:  It was a news reporter reporting a story about an old man who lives under a big tree. [Person1]:  How could that be funny? [Person2]:  Well, as he was reporting the story, hundreds of bees attacked him, and the reporter had to dive into his SUV and drive away. But he was unlucky. [Person1]:  Did he have an accident? [Person2]:  No, some bees followed him into his car. [Person1]:  I hope he got to the doctors quickly. Jack, how about a walk in the park? It's a beautiful day today. [Person2]:  But I don't feel like walking outside now. There are so many funny videos on this website. I just can't stop watching them. [Person1]:  Come on, Jack. You can't sit in front of the laptop all day. It's not good for your eyes. [Person2]:  You're right. I'll go to the park with you.
[Person1]:  This is such a beautiful day! Great for sailing! [Person2]:  It sure is! The water looks so nice! Anchor the boat for a little while. I ' m going to take a dip. [Person1]:  Why are you doggy-paddling? I taught you how to swim! Do your breast stroke! [Person2]:  I get too tired! I ' ll just backstroke, it ' s easier! [Person1]:  Try kicking your legs more. That ' s good. Don ' t go out too far! [Person2]:  It ' s fine. Jump in! [Person1]:  Kathy! Get back here! I see a shark! [Person2]:  Ahahah! ! ! Help me! Help! Bring the boat closer! The shark is coming straight towards me! [Person1]:  It ' s right under you! Kathy! ! !
[Person1]:  Hi, Sue. What's up? [Person2]:  Hey, Andrew. How's everything with work? [Person1]:  Ok, I guess. My boss has been on my back recently. [Person2]:  Really? What's he been doing? [Person1]:  You know, just giving me lots to do. I'm really busy right now. [Person2]:  Are you? What are you busy with? [Person1]:  Oh, lots of things. Mostly training new people.
[Person1]:  Can I help you? [Person2]:  I hope so. I'm looking for some material for a paper I'm writing, and I'm not quite sure where to look. [Person1]:  I'll certainly try to help you. What topic is your paper on? [Person2]:  My paper is on the influence of television on children. [Person1]:  There are several possible sources you might use for that topic. I suggest you use the computer and the computer will give you a list of every scientific journal that talks about children and television. [Person2]:  Thank you for you help.
[Person1]:  Man, that sunset is beautiful. I'Ve never seen one so red. [Person2]:  Yeah, it's pretty nice, but its so red because of air pollution. [Person1]:  Really? [Person2]:  Yeah, the smog from all these cars gets into the air and turns the sunlight red. [Person1]:  I never knew that. [Person2]:  Yeah, more people need to take public transportation or carpool. [Person1]:  Well, we'Ve already done our part. [Person2]:  Yeah, it's your turn to drive next week. Don't be late picking me up. [Person1]:  Don't worry. I'm getting more sleep these days. The baby's finally growing up a little more. [Person2]:  Well, give me a call if you can't make it for some reason.
[Person1]:  Do you have any direct flights to Toronto? [Person2]:  Sorry, we don't. But I think you can fly on Northwest Airlines to Berlin and then have a connecting flight on Canada Airline to Toronto. And it is the most economical flight, just 1, 900 dollars. [Person1]:  When does the flight depart? [Person2]:  At 8 am. By the way, it also makes a refueling stop. [Person1]:  How long is the layover? [Person2]:  Less than one hour. [Person1]:  And how long do I have to stay in Berlin for the connecting flight? [Person2]:  Not so long, just one hour. [Person1]:  So the time for the total journey is about. . . ? [Person2]:  About 13 hours. [Person1]:  Let me count. Ok, it works out for my schedule. Thanks a lot! [Person2]:  You are welcome!
[Person1]:  Do you have the day off today? How come you're not at work now? [Person2]:  I don't have the day off. Our labor union is staging a nationwide strike today, all of the workers in our department are supporting the labor union by participating and not going in to work this week. [Person1]:  Are you serious? Why would they have to go to such extreme measures like a strike? Doesn't your company have a pretty good corporate image? I'll bet the folks at headquarters are going nuts over something as serious as a strike. . . [Person2]:  It happens quite often, actually. Whenever there arises a dispute between the union and the executive group, the first thing they do is to call a strike. Usually it only lasts a day or two before both sides can come to an agreement and we start work again. Anyhow, it's a nice, unanticipated holiday. . .
[Person1]:  Would you please teach me how to use the computer? [Person2]:  Sure, let's take a look at the menu first. [Person1]:  Do I have to turn on the computer? [Person2]:  yes, we can look at the computer and computer menu at the same time. And this will help us understand both better. [Person1]:  What should I learn first? [Person2]:  Right now I'll teach you to open files, save files and copy files. Are you ready? [Person1]:  I am ready I am going to get, let's start!
[Person1]:  I need order in the court! [Person2]:  I am ready to make my plea. [Person1]:  What do you plead? [Person2]:  I plead not guilty. [Person1]:  All the evidence indicates that you are guilty. [Person2]:  I realize that, but I am not guilty. [Person1]:  Is that right? [Person2]:  I had nothing to do with the crime that was committed. [Person1]:  Who is the guilty party? [Person2]:  I'll tell you if you let me go. [Person1]:  I'd be glad to make a deal with you. [Person2]:  I am willing to tell you that information.
[Person1]:  So the apartment comes unfurnished? [Person2]:  This one is. I have another one that's furnished, but I'm not sure you'll like the furniture. [Person1]:  We have tons of furniture. What we need are air conditioners. [Person2]:  This building is only four years old. It was built with central air. [Person1]:  Just like in the States! That's perfect! [Person2]:  And I recently bought an American-style washer and dryer. Come and see.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, does this bus go to the new bookstore? [Person2]:  No, you'll have to get off at the bank, and take a No. 50. [Person1]:  Thank you. How much is the fare to that stop? [Person2]:  One dollar. [Person1]:  How many stops are there? [Person2]:  Two stops after this one. [Person1]:  Could you please tell me when we get there? [Person2]:  Sure. [Person1]:  By the way, do I need a transfer again after No. 50? [Person2]:  No, a No. 50 will take you right there.
[Person1]:  You like this china tea set, don't you? [Person2]:  Yes, but can you show me the other colour ones? [Person1]:  Sure. How about the brown one? [Person2]:  No, I don't like the brown one. [Person1]:  The blue one? [Person2]:  Good, I like it. [Person1]:  You've made a good choice. This china tea set is unusual. It was made in Jingdezhen. [Person2]:  It is extremely beautiful. This is the very thing I've been dreaming of. Please put in a gift box for me. [Person1]:  Yes, sir.
[Person1]:  Everyone seems to be on a diet. Have you noticed that? [Person2]:  At least everyone is talking about it. A neighbour of mine is on a banana diet. She eats a banana for breakfast, one for lunch, and two for dinner. [Person1]:  That's bad for the teeth and health. Has she lost any weight? [Person2]:  She doesn't look any thinner. My sister eats eggs to lose weight. Only eggs for breakfast, for lunch, and for dinner. [Person1]:  That's bad for the heart! Something in eggs is good for losing weight, but too many eggs are bad for the heart. [Person2]:  I've read that, too. Then what about a steak diet? One of my cousins doesn't eat anything but steak, even for breakfast. [Person1]:  That's bad for the bank account. The best way to lose weight is to eat less and exercise more. So, look, I'm on the way to the tennis court.
[Person1]:  You know the party last night? Lots of old faces from college were there. [Person2]:  Really? [Person1]:  Yeah. Sally was there with her husband; I heard he,s something very high up and important in some business company. [Person2]:  Yes, I heard that too. To tell you the truth, I never really expected her to marry someone successful. She was alway untidy and didn't like to work. [Person1]:  Obviously, she has changed her attitude to life. I mean she was very smartly dressed, and she kept telling me all about how much money their new house had cost. [Person2]:  Seriously. [Person1]:  Yes, she was really proud of it. [Person2]:  Well,she never used to be interested in money at all. [Person1]:  By the way, Simon Fox was at the party. [Person2]:  Was he? I haven't seen him for ages. [Person1]:  Naturally, he couldn't help asking me questions about you. [Person2]:  I think he still thinks that we might get back together one day. [Person1]:  Exactly. [Person2]:  Well, not much chance of that.
[Person1]:  Jeff, I'm going to the supermarket. Do you want to come with me?  [Person2]:  I think the supermarket is closed now.  [Person1]:  Oh, When does it close?  [Person2]:  It closes at 7 [Person1]:  That's too bad.  [Person2]:  Don't worry, we can go tomorrow morning. It opens at 8 [Person1]:  Alright. What do you want to do now?  [Person2]:  Let's take a walk for a half an hour. My sister will get here at about 8 [Person1]:  Where does she live?  [Person2]:  She lives in San Francisco.  [Person1]:  How long has she lived there?  [Person2]:  I think she's lived there for about 10 years.  [Person1]:  That's a long time. Where did she live before that?  [Person2]:  San Diego. 
[Person1]:  I'd like to make sure my plane reservation is in order. [Person2]:  May I have your flight number, please? [Person1]:  World Airlines, Flight 201. [Person2]:  And your name, please? [Person1]:  John Anderson. [Person2]:  Yes, sir. You're booked on Flight 201, leaving in one hour. [Person1]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  What's for dinner tonight? [Person2]:  What are you planning on cooking? [Person1]:  I'm not making anything. [Person2]:  If you plan on eating, you are. [Person1]:  What am I supposed to cook? [Person2]:  What do you feel like having? [Person1]:  I want some chicken and potatoes. [Person2]:  That sounds really good. [Person1]:  When are you going to make it? [Person2]:  I have no plans on cooking tonight. [Person1]:  Fine, I'll make it. [Person2]:  I knew that already.
[Person1]:  After you go back to your country, I think I will invite you to my home someday. [Person2]:  Thank you! I would love to! [Person1]:  What's the weather like in your country? I suppose it must be warmer than here. [Person2]:  Oh, yes. We have rather mild winters. It always has much sunshine in winter. But it was very foggy when I left two days ago. I knew it would be colder here, but I thought there would be a lot of snow. [Person1]:  We don't have much snow in winter in Beijing. In fact, we haven't had any so far this winter. The winter is rather long, but the cold is generally not severe. The temperature seldom gets as low as ten below zero Centigrade. [Person2]:  What is the temperature today, do you know? [Person1]:  About freezing point, I think. But the morning's forecast said that we are going to have a very cold spell in the next few days - and the temperature will probably drop to 10 or 15 degrees below zero. [Person2]:  Oh, I'm very lucky that my wife let me take a heavy overcoat. [Person1]:  It is considerate of your wife. [Person2]:  Yes, she is. By the way, what is the best season in Beijing? [Person1]:  Fall is the best season in Beijing. It's neither hot nor cold. The sky is clear and blue. There's hardly any wind, only a slight breeze which is hardly noticeable. And we have plenty of sunshine too. [Person2]:  Really? Then I will come to Beijing in the fall next time. [Person1]:  Good, you are welcome.
[Person1]:  How big is this parking lot in our community? [Person2]:  It has fifty parking spaces. [Person1]:  So you guys should be always busy. [Person2]:  Why? [Person1]:  I bet it is always full of cars. [Person2]:  Quite the contrary, sir. Plenty of the spaces here are free when people drive their cars out to work. [Person1]:  Ah. . . I see. [Person2]:  We plan to rent some of them out at the hourly rates. [Person1]:  What is the hourly rate for a car like this? [Person2]:  I am not sure. But it'll be at least ten yuan an hour. [Person1]:  How mush would it cost if someone parks here for one hour and ten minutes? [Person2]:  That would be twenty yuan, sir. We charge only by the number of hours, no split of each hour. [Person1]:  That's expensive.
[Person1]:  Bell Computers Limited, can I help you? [Person2]:  Hello, I'd like to speak to Mike please. [Person1]:  Hold on please. [Person2]:  Hello, I'm afraid Mike's unavailable right now. He's in a meeting. Can I take a message? [Person1]:  Yes, can you please let him know I called and ask him to call me back as soon as he can? My name's Mary, and I'm calling from Happy Travel. My number is 123 456 789. [Person2]:  Sorry, could you repeat that please? [Person1]:  Yes, 123 456 789, Mary from Happy Travel. Have you got that? [Person2]:  Let me read that back to you, 123 456 789, Mary from Happy Travel. I'll ask him to get back you as soon as he can. [Person1]:  Great. Thanks. [Person2]:  Anything else? [Person1]:  No, that's it. Thanks. Bye. [Person2]:  Bye.
[Person1]:  Which team do you think will emerge with the last laugh in this World Cup? [Person2]:  I wish it could be Germany. But it seems they are not in a very good conditions. [Person1]:  No, they aren't. They had a hard time in the group stage and only sealed a sit in the eighth-finals with Wallack's header in the final three minutes. Just think, group A consists of Austria, China, and Saudi Arabia, all of which are minnows. [Person2]:  It seems they've been out of luck since the beginning of the event. Their shots hit the woodwork as many as six times. Oh. my goodness! I'm afraid the team is under a spell. [Person1]:  Well, at least the Germans have demonstrated a very good ability to control the midfield. They recorded a total of 62 tackles in the match against Austria. And they to be endowed with perfect positional sense. I think that will give rise to scoring chances sooner or later. [Person2]:  I agree. Eeven though German attackers are not good at dribbling past opposing defenders, they breach the defensive line through quick movements to the right attacking positions and through accurate, well-timed passes. [Person1]:  That's why I still have very high hopes for the team. Now that the tournament has proceeded into the knock-out stage, the Germans will probably make it through to the finals. [Person2]:  Yes. They have a good reputation for their tenacity and discipline, especially in vital, decisive encounters.
[Person1]:  Hi, Mikel. What's with you? You look angry. [Person2]:  No, I just check my weight, I'm getting fatter. [Person1]:  True, you are getting a really pot belly, aren't you? [Person2]:  I'll get you for that comments, George. [Person1]:  Just kidding, Mikel. Why don't you come work out with me? [Person2]:  ah, I don't know a fit works. Last time, all I saw the gym were bunch of lidos, like me. [Person1]:  It works if you keep at it. Come on, let's go! [Person2]:  All right. But so help me it's a better work. [Person1]:  This feels great. I'm all reed up. I can keep going all night. [Person2]:  Not me. I'm too hot and I'm too tired. [Person1]:  Exercise has no benefit unless you sweat like a pig. [Person2]:  Well, that's not for me. [Person1]:  Thanks for coming, it was a real blessed. [Person2]:  It wasn't as good as you think. [Person1]:  You'll get used to it, Mikel, trust me.
[Person1]:  Dalian is a beautiful city. Do you agree?  [Person2]:  I suppose I do.  [Person1]:  The climate here is pleasant.  [Person2]:  You said it.  [Person1]:  This city is really comfortable to live in.  [Person2]:  It sure is.  [Person1]:  No other city can match it. It's heaven.  [Person2]:  Well, if you live in other cities as long as enough, you will love them just as much.  [Person1]:  Maybe.  [Person2]:  That's for sure. 
[Person1]:  What's the matter here? [Person2]:  Somebody broke into my house in the morning. [Person1]:  When did you find out? [Person2]:  About 12 o'clock, when I came home from work. [Person1]:  Apparently forced entry. The lock is battered to pieces. [Person2]:  I wonder how the burglar did it. [Person1]:  He is so unskillful. I have never seen such an awkward burglar. [Person2]:  That's because we have a strong lock. [Person1]:  Probably. Let's check the inside then. [Person2]:  Did you find anything? [Person1]:  Yes, the house was in a terrible mess. It was almost turned upside down by the burglar. [Person2]:  Oh, er. . . sorry that's because we didn't have time to clean it. [Person1]:  You mean it is not created by the burglar? [Person2]:  Definitely not, sir.
[Person1]:  Good afternoon. Which service do you require. [Person2]:  I need to increase the amount of my L / C. It's quite a new one ; I opened it 12 days ago. [Person1]:  What you need to do is apply for an amendment on your existing L / C. [Person2]:  How do I go about that? [Person1]:  You'll need to fill in this application form and there is a charge of 30 US dollars for this. [Person2]:  OK, you can take that from my account. I'll fill in the form now. [Person1]:  Thanks. Yes. . . that's all in order. What we will do now is send the L / C amendment to the negotiating bank. As soon as we know anything, we'll contact you.
[Person1]:  Good morning. [Person2]:  Er, good morning, yes, er. . . [Person1]:  I'm phoning about the job that was in the paper last night. [Person2]:  Oh, yes. Erm, well, could you tell me your name, please? [Person1]:  Oh, Candida Fawcett. [Person2]:  Oh, yes. Erm, well, what exactly is it that interests you about the job? [Person1]:  Well, I just thought that it was right up my street you know. [Person2]:  Really, hmmmm. Erm, well, could you perhaps tell me a little about yourself? [Person1]:  Yes, arm, I'm 23. I've been working abroad, I'm um. . . [Person2]:  Where exactly have you been working, please?
[Person1]:  The system keeps crashing when I try to access the personnel database. [Person2]:  I think the file is too big. You'll need to expand your memory. First, close down all the files you have open, and then. . .
[Person1]:  Could you tell me where our library is? [Person2]:  It's in the building next to ours. [Person1]:  Is it the big white one? [Person2]:  Yes, a great number of books are kept in the library. It has books in Chinese, English, Russian, German, French and many other languages. [Person1]:  Are there any reading rooms in the building? [Person2]:  Of course. How can it be a library without reading rooms? There are quite a number of reading rooms with newspapers and magazines in them on the first and second floors. [Person1]:  When is it open? [Person2]:  It is open every day except Sunday. [Person1]:  I see. Library is always a busy place. I want to borrow an English hook. I hear 'The Adventures of Tom Sawyer' is very interesting. Have you read it? [Person2]:  Yes, I enjoyed it very much. It's worth reading. [Person1]:  I wonder if you could tell me how to look it up in the card catalogue? [Person2]:  Certainly. It is written by Mark Twain. So you can either look it up under 'A' for the writer, or 'T' for the title. [Person1]:  Thank you for your great help to me. How long can I keep it? [Person2]:  You're welcome. You can keep it for two weeks. When it is due, it should be returned.
[Person1]:  Why is it so hot these days? [Person2]:  The weather report says another typhoon is forming in the western Pacific and is moving towards the mainland. [Person1]:  That's why it's burning hot these days. By the way, will our city be hit by the typhoon? [Person2]:  I'm afraid so. It will hit our city on its way towards the mainland. [Person1]:  When will it arrive? [Person2]:  It is expected to arrive here tomorrow evening. [Person1]:  So we must be prepared for it. [Person2]:  Yes. The government has warned the fishermen not to go fishing too far out to sea, and told all citizens not to stay out when the typhoon arrives. I'm afraid it will cause a serious damage. We'll have to be careful.
[Person1]:  Hello, Amy. Are you coming to my birthday party? [Person2]:  Yes, I am. How do I get to your house from the station? [Person1]:  Well, call me when you get to the station and I'll come and pick you up in my car. [Person2]:  Are you sure it won't be too much trouble? [Person1]:  It's no trouble at all. It only takes about 15 minutes. [Person2]:  Oh, I want to check your phone number. Is it 828816887? [Person1]:  No. It's 81881688. [Person2]:  Oh, really? I'm glad I checked. [Person1]:  What time do you plan to arrive at the station? [Person2]:  I plan to get there around 8 [Person1]:  OK. See you then. [Person2]:  See you. Goodbye.
[Person1]:  What? You want to leave early?  [Person2]:  Yes. Can I?  [Person1]:  Do you really need to?  [Person2]:  Yes. Is it OK with you?  [Person1]:  Is it important?  [Person2]:  Yes. Do you mind?  [Person1]:  You really have to?  [Person2]:  Yes. Will you let me?  [Person1]:  I guess so. 
[Person1]:  All right, so this is what we are going to do. I've carefully mapped this out, so don't screw it up. Mr. Rabbit, you and Mr. Fox will go into the bank wearing these uniforms. We managed to get replicas of the one the guards wear when they pick up the money.  [Person2]:  Got it.  [Person3]:  No problem, boss.  [Person1]:  When you get inside, tell them that you are filling in for Carl and Tom, and say that they are on another route today. Don't lose your cool. Just act natural.  [Person2]:  What if they want to call and confirm?  [Person1]:  You let him.  [Person3]:  What! ?  [Person1]:  Don't worry, we have the phones tapped, so the call will be patched through to me, and I'll pretend to be the transport company.  [Person2]:  Ha ha, you are so clever boss!  [Person1]:  Okay, shut up. Only take as much money as you can fit in these bags. Don't get greedy! Are you ready? Let's go. 
[Person1]:  I'm freezing, the forecast said it would be warm today. [Person2]:  But you should always be prepared for all types of weather. [Person1]:  How? You mean I should carry 4 sets of clothes with me everyday? [Person2]:  I mean, you had better bring a coat if the mornings a little cold, and pack an umbrella in your briefcase if you get wet on the way to work in the morning. You will have a miserable day in the office. [Person1]:  That's true. Well, if the weather clears up. I'm taking the afternoon off. I want to go down to the beach. [Person2]:  It's our busiest time. How can you take time off? [Person1]:  No one will miss me, anyway, if it stays cold and windy, I'll forget it. [Person2]:  Even if it warms up. I don't think it will be warm enough for the beach.
[Person1]:  Hi, Jeny.Are still working? [Person2]:  Hi, Nacy.Come in please. I'm just putting away on my books. [Person1]:  So, you are leaving, aren't you?

[Person1]:  Can you tell me something about yoga? [Person2]:  Yoga is used to promote people's physical, intellectual and mental harmony and healthy. [Person1]:  How do you feel when you practice yoga? [Person2]:  Oh, I feel really tired and sweat a lot. [Person1]:  But it will help you keep fit. [Person2]:  Sure. But more importantly, I can have peace of mind.

[Person1]:  Every year, the South has the floods. It is an act of God. [Person2]:  Do you really think so? [Person1]:  Yeah, you have some other ideas? [Person2]:  Think, in some way it is an act of God, but in another way, it just is caused by us. [Person1]:  For example? [Person2]:  We didn't pay attention to the environment, cut down trees and polluted the air. [Person1]:  Oh, I see. Fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things.
[Person1]:  You don't look like enjoying this workout. [Person2]:  I'm not crazy about it at all. [Person1]:  You don't like this sort of exercise? [Person2]:  I'm not interested in it. Are you keen on it? [Person1]:  Yes, that's funny. I thought you liked it. [Person2]:  I hate it. [Person1]:  Never mind. It'll be over in 10 minutes. [Person2]:  It's the worst thing I'Ve ever tried.
[Person1]:  Hey, Mike. Can I ask you something? [Person2]:  Sure, what's up? [Person1]:  I'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight. Who do you think will win? [Person2]:  Good question. I have to think about it. [Person1]:  My husband is betting on France. [Person2]:  France? Is he crazy? [Person1]:  What do you mean? [Person2]:  Well, how do I put this? France is a terrible team.
[Person1]:  I really need to lose some weight. I should go on a diet. [Person2]:  I think you should work out more too. [Person1]:  Wow! You are much skinnier since the last time I saw you. [Person2]:  I have lost about five kilos. [Person1]:  How did you do it? [Person2]:  I was on a diet and exercised daily. [Person1]:  I hate working out. [Person2]:  You can try a low-impact workout schedule. Why don't you go to a gym? [Person1]:  Good idea. Then the trainer will help me to make a fitness plan. Besides that, what's your secret? [Person2]:  The secret is persistence.
[Person1]:  Only 2 months to go, so what are you going to do after graduating from college? [Person2]:  My uncle has a company. He'll give me a job. I want to gain some work experience there. [Person1]:  How long do you plan to work there? [Person2]:  Just one year. Then I'll look for another job. [Person1]:  Why won't you just worked for your uncle? [Person2]:  Because I want to go to London and work there. You know the competition is very fierce there. With some work experience, I can find a job there more easily. So what's your plan? [Person1]:  I'll find a job in this city and work here for one year. Then I'll go back to college to get my degree in business. [Person2]:  Are you interested in working for my uncle? [Person1]:  Thanks. But I've applied for 3 jobs. [Person2]:  Have you got any replies? [Person1]:  Yes, 2 of them have offered me a position.
[Person1]:  Did you see the woman that just left my office? [Person2]:  Yes. [Person1]:  She's another applicant, and a leading contender, but I didn't want to hire her. She's qualified, but she doesn't quite fit the profile. We're looking for an accountant, and part of the job requires interacting with clients. Well, our clients want conservative people to handle their money. And green hair with ripped jeans doesn't exactly fill them with trust. [Person2]:  But it's the style now. [Person1]:  I realize that, but our business is serving clients and giving them what they want. [Person2]:  Of course. [Person1]:  Well, they don't want to deal with people who look like that. They want people who look more like yourself. [Person2]:  Why is that? [Person1]:  Well, they're older, and they don't understand today's fashions. When they see someone dressed like that, warning bells go off. They don't like that style at all, and they don't like dealing with people who dress like that at work. [Person2]:  Oh, I see. [Person1]:  We used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good, very good. But, the clients reacted very negatively when they saw her. Some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more conservatively. [Person2]:  What happened to her? [Person1]:  Well, she was a very good employee and we wanted to keep her, so her supervisor called her in for a chat and laid it on the line for her. She got the idea and now she saves the trendy styles for evenings and weekends. [Person2]:  I see.
[Person1]:  May I have an appointment with you tonight? [Person2]:  Very sorry, I am occupied tonight. What about tomorrow night? [Person1]:  OK. where and when? [Person2]:  7 [Person1]:  OK, I am going to the hotel to pick you up. See you tomorrow night.

[Person1]:  Hi, Steven. You have finished a wonderful project recently. [Person2]:  Oh, yeah, A. Thank you for approving my job. [Person1]:  Don't be proud. You'll gain a lot in the following job. [Person2]:  Yeah, I believe it, but I want to know if you will give me a raise. [Person1]:  B, talking about salary is not smart. You are a new manager and you'd better learn more professional skills. [Person2]:  You are right, boss, but I need specific confirm to keep the future work better. [Person1]:  Okay, You are such a good talker.
[Person1]:  We're going to discuss how to market CB series soon. Does your project go well? [Person2]:  Absolutely. I've sorted out all the materials we need and sifted three great ways of marketing. [Person1]:  Oh, that's good. [Person2]:  We can discuss them detailedly over the meeting and choose the best way to promote our key products. [Person1]:  It seems you've got everything done. Now I can finally stop worrying about it and get back to work.
[Person1]:  How about drink, Sir? [Person2]:  A cup of coffee, please. [Person1]:  Would you like cream or sugar in your coffee? [Person2]:  I'd like a little sugar, please. [Person1]:  Sorry, I don't have any sugar. [Person2]:  Why did you ask me if I wanted some? [Person1]:  I don't know. I just wasn't thinking.
[Person1]:  Good afternoon, Miss. [Person2]:  Good afternoon. I would like my hair done. [Person1]:  What style do you want? [Person2]:  I'd like to try a new hair-style.

[Person1]:  One hundred yuan, please. [Person2]:  Here you are. [Person1]:  Thank you.

[Person1]:  That's alright. We'll try to have a meeting for the details of the order and send it to you this Thursday. I hope you tell your market manager about it. [Person2]:  OK. Once we get our purchase order, we will begin preparing your bookings. [Person1]:  Thanks. We need the products in one month. [Person2]:  Fine.
[Person1]:  Do you have any plans for next year? [Person2]:  Well, I travel if I could afford it but I don't have any money. [Person1]:  If you found a job abroad, would you take it? [Person2]:  If it were somewhere I want to go, I'd certainly consider it carefully. [Person1]:  What about working as an (?) living with the family and doing some housework? [Person2]:  I'd only consider it if I was sure about the family. If they didn't treat me well, I'd be very miserable. [Person1]:  Yes, you'd get information through a reputable agency. We have a list in the office, I'll get you one if you are interested. [Person2]:  Yes, I am. Um, if I decided to reply, would you get me a reference? [Person1]:  Of course. [Person2]:  Thank you very much. I'll let you know [Person1]:  OK, I'd like that.
[Person1]:  Well, thank you. Mr. Parry, for all your information. Just one more question. [Person2]:  Yes, sir? [Person1]:  Do you play any sports or games?

[Person2]:  I was a runner-a long-distance runner. [Person1]:  And now? [Person2]:  No. I'm afraid I haven't had time since I got married. [Person1]:  Well, thank you again for coming to see us. But just remember that we like people who join the company to play in the company sports teams. [Person2]:  Certainly, sir.

I don't like 7 fifteen, now that I think about it. Change it to 7 thirty. [Person2]:  The second call is now changed to 7 thirty. Is there anything else we can help you with? [Person1]:  Nothing that I can think of right now. If something comes up, though, I'll call you. [Person2]:  We're here all night long if you need anything.

[Person1]:  What can I do? [Person2]:  The system crashed when I was surfing on the internet. [Person1]:  Did you go to any illegal website? [Person2]:  No, But does that matter? [Person1]:  Yes, your computer can be easily infected by virus if you do that. [Person2]:  I see. I'd better never try. [Person1]:  That's wise. [Person2]:  Do you know what's wrong with my PC? [Person1]:  One minute. Oh, yes, it was infected by a virus, and you had no antivirus software. [Person2]:  Is anti-virus software necessary for a PC? [Person1]:  Of course. You'd better learn something about it. [Person2]:  I'm afraid yes. But what about the data I stored in the computer? [Person1]:  Don't worry, it should have been protected automatically. And I take an anti-virus software with me. Do you want me to install it now? [Person2]:  Yes, please. I'll really appreciate that.

[Person1]:  I don't know what a bench warrant is. [Person2]:  You apparently missed a court appearance. [Person1]:  I was never told to go to court. [Person2]:  There's nothing I can do about that. [Person1]:  This isn't fair. [Person2]:  That's life. [Person1]:  What about my rights? [Person2]:  Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
[Person1]:  Okay, doctor, tell it to me straight. [Person2]:  If you want to live much longer you have to give up smoking. [Person1]:  I've tried before. Everything I've tried doesn't work. [Person2]:  Maybe with the choice of life or death before you, you will find it easier. [Person1]:  May I see that x-ray again? [Person2]:  See all these black areas?

Did he hurt you? [Person2]:  No, he didn't hurt me, but he took my handbag. [Person1]:  Then what happened? What did you do? [Person2]:  I caught hold of his knife, and he pushed me to the floor.

[Person1]:  I can't believe the cost of apartments in New York City.  [Person2]:  Oh, you didn't know that apartments here are considered valuable, even if they are small and crowded?  [Person1]:  Of course I had heard about that, but now I know how expensive it is to rent a place here.  [Person2]:  I don't mind paying high rent to live in New York.  [Person1]:  Why? You pay so much for such a tiny space to live.  [Person2]:  Yeah, but so what! I'm proud to live in the world's most excting city. And, the salaries here are the highest in the nation, too.

You can wait for two weeks. If you don't get a telephone call, it means that you weren't successful. [Person2]:  Then do I have the chance to get this job? [Person1]:  I'm sorry but I can't make the final decision myself, and I have to discuss it with other interviewers. [Person2]:  I know. No matter what the result will be, I have learned a lot from our conversation. [Person1]:  Your mentality is very good and that's great. [Person2]:  Thanks for giving me the opportunity of this interview. [Person1]:  My pleasure.
[Person1]:  Henry, where did you go for your holiday? [Person2]:  I went to Los Angeles. [Person1]:  How long did you stay there? [Person2]:  I got there on October tenth and returned on the sixteenth. [Person1]:  How did you like the city? [Person2]:  It's much bigger than I expected, it's really hard to get around. I didn't like the bus service or the subway system there. So I borrowed a car to get around. It's really much more convenient with a car.
[Person1]:  Have you handed in your papers, John? [Person2]:  Sorry, Mrs. Smith. I haven't finished them yet. [Person1]:  But you must have handed them in by last Friday. And now it's Monday.

[Person1]:  I need something to wash this down. Is there any juice in the fridge? [Person2]:  What is that? It looks like something from a swamp! [Person1]:  It's a green drink. It's supposed to be full of vitamins and minerals. [Person2]:  You know, healthy eating doesn't have to make you gag. [Person1]:  The sales lady said that even if I eat right, I wouldn't get enough vitamins. [Person2]:  Have you ever tried it? Or are you just going to believe the sales lady? [Person1]:  It's easier to drink this once a day than eat fruit and vegetables all day. [Person2]:  It may take less time, but I don't know about easier. Yuck.

As the saying goes, all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. You should spare some time for a rest. [Person2]:  I know it is no good for my health if I am staying in the classroom all day. But how about my paper? [Person1]:  Just take it easy. Come on with me. [Person2]:  I'm terribly sorry I can't go with you. Shall we find some other time?

[Person1]:  So, what's new in the kitchen? That refrigerator is new, isn't it? [Person2]:  Yes. I needed a large one. Before, I had a separate refrigerator and freezer, but this has both combined into one. [Person1]:  That's usual nowadays. You'Ve added a few shelves too. [Person2]:  Yes. You know I'Ve been cooking more kind of food recently and I needed some extra space for spices and ingredients. [Person1]:  Did you buy new cupboards too? [Person2]:  No, I didn't.

[Person1]:  Looking at the spice rack, I'd say you'Ve been learning how to make asian food. [Person2]:  Yes. I'Ve always likes Indian and thai food, so I'Ve been trying to make dishes from those countries. I'm pretty good at making curries now, but I still need practice at making thai food.

[Person2]:  It varies from time to time. At present it is 6%. [Person1]:  By the way, can I open a checking account too? [Person2]:  Sure. But you have to deposit enough money before you write out your checks. [Person1]:  Oh, I see. Thank you very much. [Person2]:  My pleasure.
[Person1]:  What is the difference between a lesson and a lecture? [Person2]:  Well, they are both ways of imparting knowledge, but the main difference is that you participate in a lesson whereas you just listen to a lecture. A lecture is generally given to a much larger group.

[ Come on! ] You know how tender ... tender my skin is. [Person1]:  wimp! We can do ... Okay. So Monday, we'll go down to the lake. Tuesday, we're going to go mountain biking. Um, it's supposed to be cloudy so your tender skin shouldn't get burned. [Person2]:  Oh, that's sounds great ... but I'd probably crash like I did last time and break my arm or something.

[ Okay. ] Um, Wendesay I was thinking we could go fishing. Remember the last time we went? I caught like 10 huge fish ... [Person2]:  Yeah. I remember. And the only thing I caught was an old boot. And you won't ever, EVER let me forget that one. So, if we do anything, I'd like to enjoy it. [Person1]:  Well, okay then. Um, do you suggest? [Person2]:  Well, alright. Well, we could stay home and uh, you know ... pop some popcorn and play like Scrabble or another board game. Yeah, something like that .... What?

He is pretty upset about it, but what can you do? He really is pasted. [Person1]:  He is all alone, isn't he? [Person2]:  Yes, his wife has been dead for years. They had one daughter, Dories. But she went off to town as soon as she left school. And he hasn't heard from her since. I hear she is making good money as a model. [Person1]:  Maybe someone could get in touch with her. Get her to come back for a while to help? [Person2]:  I don't suppose she come. She never got on with her father. He is bit of a tough character and she is rather selfish. Oh, I expect old Jake will get by. He is healthy at least, comes into a clinic for a check regularly. [Person1]:  Are you his doctor? [Person2]:  No, my partner doctor Johnson is.

[Person1]:  It's just a simple decorating. I just want to add my personality to my living space. 
[Person1]:  Hello, this is Mary speaking. Who's that? [Person2]:  It's me, Peter. [Person1]:  Oh, hello, Peter, whom do you want to speak to? [Person2]:  Can I speak to John? [Person1]:  No, you can't speak to him now. [Person2]:  Isn't he in right now? [Person1]:  Yes, he is in, but he is very busy. [Person2]:  What is he doing, may I know?

[Person1]:  What are you reading, Mike? [Person2]:  I'm reading something about how people around the world celebrate the new year. Do you know what people in the southern part of the United States do for good luck in the new year? [Person1]:  I have a friend called Lisa from Austin, who once told me people in her city often eat black eyed peas and pork for that purpose, and people in other parts of the country eat sauerkraut with pork sausage on New Year's Day. [Person2]:  That's true. Do you know what the Spanish do? [Person1]:  Certainly. I've been learning Spanish and from one text I learned that in Spain, as the clock strikes midnight, people eat grapes? [Person2]:  Yes, these grapes represent the months of the year, and eating the mall in the first 12 seconds of the New Year guarantees that the year will be filled with good luck. [Person1]:  Does the article mentioned what the Chinese do? [Person2]:  No, but it says that in the Philippines, many People eat and displayed 12 round fruits to bring them a good year. [Person1]:  I really want to learn more. Can I read the article? [Person2]:  Certainly, take your time.

You know, now I'm not as busy as before, and I spend more time hanging out with friends and sleeping. [Person2]:  Do you also exercise? [Person1]:  Not really. But I'm on a diet, I don't want to put on any weight. [Person2]:  Well, I think working out works better. I've really fallen in love with exercising. You can give it a shot, too. [Person1]:  I'll consider that.
[Person1]:  I have learnt how to ride a bicycle. I plan to go to the Water Park by bike this weekend. [Person2]:  Well, you know, the traffic in Beijing is sometimes dangerous. Therefore, I have to remind you of something. First, you should obey the traffic rules, don't break in the red light. Second, don't play a joke with your friends when riding on the bike. Third, do not hurry up when riding, or would make an accident. Finally, remember come on the left and go on the right! [Person1]:  Oh, my dear sister, I am no longer a baby!

[Person1]:  Lester, you are really fantastic at automobile repair. [Person2]:  Thanks, June. But I think I need to be certified as a mechanic 5 before I'm allowed to repair cars for a living. [Person1]:  That's not a big problem. There are many small schools for adults like you who can study to be certified. [Person2]:  I guess I never thought of that before. [Person1]:  And you can easily get a student loan from a vocational school, or from the government. [Person2]:  Wow, you'Ve inspired me to do something!
[Person1]:  Uncle, have a heart, please lend your new car to me. Only once. [Person2]:  Where are you going? [Person1]:  I have a big date tonight. [Person2]:  You have got a car, haven't you? [Person1]:  Oh, please. Only once lend your new car to me.

[Person1]:  How do you get along with your boss? [Person2]:  I had a terrific working relationship with my boss, even though we are very different people. Because I've had a number of bosses, I've come to realize that to make things work, you have to understand what's important to your boss. Then you have to do everything you can to support him ( or her ). It's natural to think about your own agenda first, but if you help your boss, Ifs likely to move your agenda ahead at the same time. My last boss was great in that regard, she appreciated my efforts and rewarded me when I helped her accomplish her goals. [Person1]:  What do you think is important in your work? [Person2]:  Many are important, intelligence, diligence, information and planning. But the most important, I think, is achieving results.
[Person1]:  Hi, how are you doing?  [Person2]:  I'm fine. How about yourself?  [Person1]:  I'm pretty good. Thanks for asking.  [Person2]:  No problem. So how have you been?  [Person1]:  I've been great. What about you?  [Person2]:  I've been good. I'm in school right now.  [Person1]:  What school do you go to?  [Person2]:  I go to PCC.  [Person1]:  Do you like it there?  [Person2]:  It's okay. It's a really big campus.  [Person1]:  Good luck with school.  [Person2]:  Thank you very much. 
[Person1]:  Janet, it's Oscar. Did I wake you up? [Person2]:  No, but I'm going to get up then. [Person1]:  Sorry, listen. I'll arrive in Florida on the fifteenth Orlando Airport. Do you want to meet me then? [Person2]:  Sure, welcome to Florida, and how are you going to Disney World? [Person1]:  I will take a taxi at the airport, how about meeting there? [Person2]:  Why don't we meet at the Kennedy Space Center. It's not that far from my company. [Person1]:  Ok, and then I'm meeting John Hamilton. Do you remember him? [Person2]:  Yeah. I remember him. What else are you going to do with him? [Person1]:  We're going to dive, then will drive straight up to Panhandle. You know, we want to spend some time relaxing on the beach. [Person2]:  Right. Call me when you arrive in Florida.
[Person1]:  I'd like to congratulate you on your wonderful performance. [Person2]:  Thank you very much. [Person1]:  I read about you in the newspaper and decided to come and hear you play. I have traveled many miles and I'm very glad I made the effort. You played the piano beautifully. What are your next plans? [Person2]:  At present, I'm giving a lot of concerts. Fortunately, people want to come and hear me play. But I'm getting very tired of traveling. [Person1]:  Why are you working so hard? [Person2]:  I'm planning to start a school, so I'm trying to save as much money as possible. [Person1]:  What kind of school? [Person2]:  A music school for disabled children. I think they have the right to receive an education, just like any other children. At the moment, there are very few such schools in my country. Unfortunately, it will cost a lot of money to start one. [Person1]:  But I'm sure a lot of people will support you. I hope you will be able to realize your dream.
[Person1]:  So tell me, what's the difference between the Board of Directors, the CEO, and the stockholders? They all seems ot be the same group of people to me... [Person2]:  No, there's a definite difference. You know, the stockholders are the people who own the company... they're the financial control system. Then there's the CEO, the chief executive officer. He's the hot shot, the main guy who is the boss. If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization, everyone knows that the power will go to their head. It's too dangerous. That's the reason for a Board of Directors. The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry. They could be related to the organization, but more commonly, they are independent and non-biased. [Person1]:  How many people are on the board of directors? [Person2]:  Usually not more than 15, not less than 10. They meet monthly, quarterly, or biannually to oversee an organization or company. They provide long term planing and vision, and also act as moral watchdogs rto keep the company in line.
[Person1]:  I have to get to Chicago by tomorrow and you're telling me that there are no flights? [Person2]:  I'm very sorry, sir. I could put you on a waiting list, but you would be wise to check out other means of travel. [Person1]:  You mean like a bus? Have you ever traveled for ten hours on a bus before? [Person2]:  I have not sir. But I do have a number for a very comfortable bus that goes to Chicago every hour from here. [Person1]:  Alright, give me the number. But put me on that waiting list as well. [Person2]:  Here is the number, and your name is on the waiting list. [Person1]:  How many people are on the waiting list right now? [Person2]:  Right now I show that there are 176 people on the list. And you are number 176.
[Person1]:  it seems the department still has some money left in the budget. Do you have any suggestions how to use it before the budget is renewed? [Person2]:  what about renting a restaurant and treating the employees to a nice dinner? [Person1]:  but we've done that many times. We want something fresh this time. [Person2]:  okay, let me think. What about a party-and-movie night? We can rearrange our reference room, invite a band to play some music, order in some food and watch a movie later. [Person1]:  sounds like a good idea, but a band sounds too expensive. [Person2]:  well, we can ask people to make small contributions. [Person1]:  I don't think so. I don't think people are going to like it if they have to pay to come. But we certainly can cut costs in other ways, such as make the party BYOB. [Person2]:  BYOB? What's that? [Person1]:  bring your own beverage. We can provide food, but people have to bring their own drinks. [Person2]:  so we're just going to have a party where they bring their own drinks and we just give them some snacks? I don't know how well that will go over. [Person1]:  maybe you have a point. How about having a party on a Friday afternoon? We'll stop early, order some pizza, and serve drinks. There'll be music but no band. Having the party in the office will make [Person2]:  oh, that sounds like fun!
[Person1]:  Watch out! You'll hit that car if you're not careful. [Person2]:  Oh no, I won't. But we will have an accident if you don't stop shouting. [Person1]:  You see. I told you you'd hit him if you weren't careful. [Person2]:  Oh, shut up, will you? It was all your fault. If you'd kept quite this would never have happened. [Person1]:  Oh, so it was my fault, was it? If I hadn't warned you in time it would have been much worse.
[Person1]:  Hi, I'm testify chen, the tour guide for the Ged Agency. We have a reservation of twenty room for tonight. [Person2]:  Please to meet you Mrs. Chen. My name is Joy. Welcome to the hotel. Here is the keys, registration slips and breakfast description. Breakfast will be served from seven tomorrow morning. Is there any change of your schedule? [Person1]:  No. Our check out time is still be eight thirty tomorrow. [Person2]:  And we arrange a morning call at seven thirty. Is that be fine? [Person1]:  That's alright. [Person2]:  Please put your luggage outside your room by eight. The bail-boy will pick them up. [Person1]:  Thank you. [Person2]:  Thank you very much. I hope you enjoy your stay.
[Person1]:  It's very kind of you to show me around. [Person2]:  Not at all. What would you like to see first? [Person1]:  I really don't know. [Person2]:  Let's walk around the lake first, shall we? [Person1]:  Yes, that would be lovely. [Person2]:  Have you been here before? [Person1]:  No, it's the first time I've been here. [Person2]:  I will take you to Li River after walking around here. [Person1]:  That's wonderful! I have heard the scene of Li River is beautiful! [Person2]:  Yes, you'll be in a different world there.
[Person1]:  What do you want to do tonight? [Person2]:  I don't know. What do you want to do? [Person1]:  I have no idea. Do you think we're in a rut? [Person2]:  What do you mean? [Person1]:  Well, we do the same things every weekend. We go to the same restaurants. We see the same friends. You know what I mean? [Person2]:  Yeah, I guess you're right. It's easy to get bogged down in the day to day, and forget to change things up once in a while. Let's break out and do something completely different tonight. [Person1]:  Okay, I'll look in the events section of the paper to see what's going on tonight. Hmm, we could go to a concert. There is a good one tonight. I bet it's not sold out. But, we'll have to drive an hour to the venue. [Person2]:  An hour? That's a bit of a bummer. Let me take a peek and see what else there is. How about going dancing? We haven't done that in a while. There's a club in Silver Lake that's supposed to be hopping on Friday nights. Eddie from work told me that they have a really good DJ and a big dance floor, and the cover charge isn't bad. [Person1]:  I'm not really in the mood for dancing, actually. You know what? I just feel like staying home tonight and vegging, after all. How about you? [Person2]:  Yeah, I was hoping you'd say that. It's nice to have the option to go out but I'd rather stay in. Maybe we can go out tomorrow night. [Person1]:  Yeah, definitely, tomorrow night.
[Person1]:  Where is the boss? I need him to sign a few documents. I checked in his office, but he is not there. Is he out of the office now? [Person2]:  Yes. Today is Tuesday, so the boss went off to his MBA seminar class. He is out of the office every Tuesday and Thursday mornings, and he has classes all day Saturday and Sunday. [Person1]:  What's he studying? [Person2]:  He is finishing up a special continue education program for executives. He can continue working, taking a few of classes here and there, and in 2 years he will complete his MBA. [Person1]:  Sounds like a tiring schedule. He's probably got a lot of homework too, eh? [Person2]:  The classes have him out of the office, so that is stressful for him. But as far as homework goes, it is a breeze for him. [Person1]:  Why is that? [Person2]:  He just has his secretary do his homework for him.
[Person1]:  Hi, Bob. I heard that you had passed your driving test. Is it true? [Person2]:  Yes. A few days ago I have no right to get a driving licence. But now I get it. [Person1]:  Is the driving test difficult? [Person2]:  Yes, it can be quite tough. Many people fail to pass the test at the first time. [Person1]:  What does the driving test require? [Person2]:  You should enroll in driving school and then take a road test and a written test. After you pass both tests, you'll get your licence. [Person1]:  Oh, I see. I need more practice before I take the driving test. [Person2]:  Don't worry about your driving test. I think you will pass the test and get the driver's licence very soon. [Person1]:  Hopeful! Thank you.
[Person1]:  Anything interesting in the paper today? [Person2]:  Let's have a look. Well, yeah, there are a few here that might interest us. Here's one for just under 400. It only has one bedroom but it sounds nice. Near a park. It'd be nice to live near a park. [Person1]:  Mm. But, you know, 390 seems expensive for just one bedroom. [Person2]:  Yes, you're right. Oh, here's one that's a little cheaper, near University Avenue. It's 350. [Person1]:  How many bedrooms? [Person2]:  Just one again. That's not a very nice area. [Person1]:  No, it's pretty noisy. I'd prefer a larger place really. [Person2]:  Yeah. Let me see what the cheapest twobedroom apartment is. Oh, here's a real bargain. It's only 350. But it doesn't have any furniture. [Person1]:  No. You know how much it can cost to furnish an apartment. [Person2]:  Oh, here's another one for just over 400. This sounds very interesting. It's on Metealfe. That's a nice street. [Person1]:  Yes, it's quiet.
[Person1]:  I need to find somewhere to park.  [Person2]:  Off campus or on campus?  [Person1]:  I need to find a space on campus.  [Person2]:  Why don't you park in the parking structure for students?  [Person1]:  Where is the parking structure at?  [Person2]:  It's on the west side of the campus.  [Person1]:  Do you know if the parking structure is full or not?  [Person2]:  It was empty last time I went up there.  [Person1]:  How long ago was that?  [Person2]:  I went up there early this morning.  [Person1]:  Do you think it'll be full now?  [Person2]:  It might be. You'll have to go see for yourself. 
[Person1]:  Did you have a nice weekend Charlie? [Person2]:  Not really, I went camping with my family. [Person1]:  That sounds fun. [Person2]:  It wasn't, camping is so boring. I didn't have any service on my phone, so I couldn't check Facebook or Twitter the whole weekend. [Person1]:  That doesn't sound like a big deal, didn't you enjoy hiking or swimming with your family? [Person2]:  Not really. I enjoyed taking pictures of us fishing, but I couldn't even post them until we got back on Monday. [Person1]:  Um, it sounds to me like you need to learn how to enjoy life without sharing every moment on social media.
[Person1]:  Hello Rick, I've come to say goodbye to you. [Person2]:  Are you going back to your country Canada? [Person1]:  No, I'll travel in Europe with my parents as this term is over. I want to go to France. But my parents preferred Germany. We'll travel for 2 months. [Person2]:  Wow, the whole summer vacation, wish you an enjoyable holiday.
[Person1]:  Are you going on to graduate school when you get your BA? [Person2]:  I have considered going on for a Masters degree, but I may put off getting it. [Person1]:  Why is that? [Person2]:  I think I'd like to work for a while before I start graduate school. [Person1]:  I've considered working for a while. But I don't want to put off learning Chinese. [Person2]:  Have you considered taking time off to go to China again? [Person1]:  I've thought of doing that. If I get a chance, I will. Otherwise I'll finish the graduate program and then go. [Person2]:  With a graduate degree you will have more opportunities.
[Person1]:  Excuse me. Where is the way out? [Person2]:  Well, that's what I'm looking for myself. [Person1]:  It's very confusing in here, isn't it? [Person2]:  Absolutely. Oh, do you see a sign there? [Person1]:  It should be the way out. [Person2]:  OK. Let's go and see.
[Person1]:  Excuse me. Are these chips on sale? [Person2]:  Yes. You will save 90 cents on each bag. [Person1]:  Is there any limit? [Person2]:  No, no limit. You can take as many as you want. [Person1]:  That's good. Thanks. [Person2]:  You're welcome.
[Person1]:  Have you got any plans for the coming holiday? [Person2]:  Yes, I have a very special one. I will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks. A friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer keepers. I was very interested. So I asked him to get me the application form. Lucky, my application was approved by the manager very soon. [Person1]:  Volunteer in a zoo? What specific things will you do? [Person2]:  I will help to prepare food, feed animals and clean up. I'm very excited about it now. [Person1]:  It must be a unique experience. I'm looking forward to share your story when you come back. [Person2]:  Ok, I will bring you photos as many as possible.
[Person1]:  hello, Kate! How are you doing? [Person2]:  fine, thanks. How are you? [Person1]:  fine. How are your term papers? [Person2]:  oh, my lord. I haven't really started them. [Person1]:  how could it be? They are due two weeks later. [Person2]:  I know but I was busy with my part-time job the last few days. [Person1]:  Kate, you know, I am thinking of getting a part-time job next year because I really need more money and I don't want to ask my parents for any more. But I'm so busy! How am I going to work and study [Person2]:  to be honest with you, Jason, I don't think I'm doing a very good job of balancing my schoolwork with my job. I'm always two steps behind. I've got to get back to the dorm and continue writing tha [Person1]:  my advisor?
[Person1]:  ( Before Christmas Party ) Are you ready for the Christmas party tonight [Person2]:  Almost. I have to get dressed. It's a formal party and I have special party make up! [Person1]:  Use this lipstick and it will make your lips shine! [Person2]:  Great! Uh, remember that there's a gift exchange, too. We all have to bring a gift. [Person1]:  I've already got mine. [Person2]:  ( At the Party ) It's Christmas Eve! Time to open presents! [Person1]:  Here! Open mine first. [Person2]:  Wow! It's just what I wanted! [Person1]:  Hey! Why don't I have any presents!
[Person1]:  Welcome. What can I do for you this morning? [Person2]:  I'm here on holiday and I don't have a local debit card. Is it possible to withdraw money on my Visa credit card here? [Person1]:  Well, welcome to our country. I trust you are having a pleasant stay? [Person2]:  Oh, yes. It's amazing here. I don't think I ever want to go home again! [Person1]:  That's the opinion of most people. Do you have your passport with you? I'll need to see that and you'll need to fill in this withdrawal form. [Person2]:  Fine. Here you go. [Person1]:  How much would you like to withdraw? [Person2]:  Is it OK to withdraw USD? [Person1]:  That's fine. [Person2]:  OK, 200 USD, please. [Person1]:  Here's your money, your card and your passport. Please double check the amount for me. [Person2]:  Perfect. Thanks!
[Person1]:  Have you bought War Craft 2 yet? [Person2]:  Yeah! I bought it the day it was released. [Person1]:  How do you like it? [Person2]:  It's a great game. There are a lot of new characters. [Person1]:  Did it cost very much [Person2]:  It cost about thirty. Most games cost about that much. [Person1]:  Mechwarrior is such a good game. The graphics are awesome! [Person2]:  Oh, I know what you mean. I'm addicted to that game. [Person1]:  My roommate always wants to play it. But I told her to buy her own game. [Person2]:  Yeah, my roommate likes to watch me play. He says it's like watching a movie. [Person1]:  I've never seen such good graphics. [Person2]:  And I've never heard such good sound in a game.
[Person1]:  Could you please cover for me two hours this morning? [Person2]:  Sure. Any specific reason I should know about in case people ask where you are. [Person1]:  I have to see the dentist. We have an appointment for this morning from 9 to 11 o'clock. So if there is any phone call, please pick up for me. If there is something urgent, tell them I will be back in two hours. [Person2]:  No problem. Good luck. [Person1]:  Yes, I will need it. Thanks.
[Person1]:  Hello. I'd like to change my reservation for March 19. My name is Mary Chang. [Person2]:  Ah, yes, Miss Chang. What seems to be the problem? [Person1]:  Well, I'd like to change the date to March 20, and make that for two singles, not one. [Person2]:  Very well. That can be arranged.
[Person1]:  Hello sir, how may I help you? [Person2]:  I would like to buy some flowers, please. Something really nice. [Person1]:  I see, may I ask what the occasion is? [Person2]:  It's not really an occasion, it's more like I'm sorry. [Person1]:  Very well. This arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends. It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out. It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness. [Person2]:  I think I'm gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear. What else do you recommend? [Person1]:  Mmm, well this is our ' I'm sorry I cheated on you ' package. Two dozen red roses lined with tulips, carnations and lilies. The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you. [Person2]:  I don't think that's gonna cut it. I need something bigger and better! [Person1]:  I'm sorry sir but, what exactly did you do? [Person2]:  Well, I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier. [Person1]:  Get out of my store, you jerk!
[Person1]:  Hello. I am calling to apply for the job as an airlines staff. I'd like to check it. Is it part-time or a full-time job? [Person2]:  OK, the job is a full-time one. [Person1]:  What does the job description say? [Person2]:  We need a person with ability and flexibility.
[Person1]:  How is the weather today? [Person2]:  Nice and bright, not too cold. [Person1]:  Much better than yesterday, isn't it? [Person2]:  Yes. But it may be windy and colder later. [Person1]:  I don't mind as long as it doesn't snow. [Person2]:  What was the temperature yesterday? [Person1]:  It was five below. [Person2]:  I guess the lake is covered with ice. Skating today would be nice. [Person1]:  But I don't think the ice is strong enough yet. It might be dangerous. [Person2]:  Perhaps you are right. I hope for colder weather. [Person1]:  I also hope.
[Person1]:  Hey Susan, are you interested in buying some used books for school? You can really save some money that way. [Person2]:  Well, what do you have? [Person1]:  Well, let's see. I have a science book called Today's World and I am selling it for 30 dollars. [Person2]:  30. That's too expensive for a broken book like that. [Person1]:  Maybe so, but I bought it for 60 and I wrote a lot of notes in the book that should help you with the class if you could read my writing. [Person2]:  What else are you selling? [Person1]:  OK, I have an English writing textbook for 14 dollars, a math book for 23 and a novel for only 7. [Person2]:  Hmm... [Person1]:  It's up to you. You know these things go fast. [Person2]:  OK, I'll take the writing book and the novel. I need both of those for sure. [Person1]:  No more textbooks? [Person2]:  Not now. Teachers are always changing their minds about textbooks. [Person1]:  All right.
[Person1]:  Good morning, sir. Can I help you? [Person2]:  I'd like to buy a blue jacket. Do you have any blue jackets? [Person1]:  Yes. What size do you wear? [Person2]:  I want Size M. [Person1]:  Here you are. Try it on and see whether it is all right for you. [Person2]:  It's all right. I like it very much. How much is it? [Person1]:  360 Yuan. [Person2]:  Oh. That's a bit expensive. Do you have any other kind? I want a cheaper one. [Person1]:  What about this one? It's only 120 Yuan. [Person2]:  OK. I'll take this one. Here is the money.
[Person1]:  Hi Fiona, I've known the result of the writing competition that you entered. You've done a great piece of writing. [Person2]:  Thank you. I wasn't really expecting to win. [Person1]:  So the results was a great surprise. [Person2]:  Yes, but I guess I wasn't satisfied with my writing at all. Anyway, I know you're really good at writing so can you have a look at that sometime? It'll be great if you could give me some help on how I could improve. I really want to be a journalist like you when I'm older.
[Person1]:  Good morning. I'd like to join the school volunteer project, but I'm not sure what I should do. [Person2]:  OK, don't worry. Let me help you. What do you like doing? [Person1]:  I love writing stories. [Person2]:  Well, you must be good at telling stories. Am I right? [Person1]:  Yes, of course. [Person2]:  Then why not help us look after children on weekends? [Person1]:  That's a good idea. I can tell them stories. I am sure children will love my stories and me. [Person2]:  I agree with you. Can you tell me your name and telephone number? [Person1]:  Oh, sorry. I nearly forgot. I am Jim Green. My telephone number is 8832765.
[Person1]:  French is so hard, do you know what's the most difficult part for me? [Person2]:  The grammar? [Person1]:  Yes, but only one particular area. I can't remember if a word is male or female. [Person2]:  You have to just remember those. [Person1]:  But there are so many and I can't find a pattern. For instance, the moon is female and the sun is male. I know those are common in different languages, but a chair is female and hair is male. I think that hair would be considered female. I just don't get it. [Person2]:  It can be very confusing, don't let it get you down, Andy. You're doing well this term. One bad quiz score will hardly affect your grade. Your reading is excellent and so is your writing, you'll get used to this part of the language soon enough.
[Person1]:  It was very nice of you to invite me. [Person2]:  I'm very glad you could come, Doctor Wong. What would you like? [Person1]:  This is my first time at a Chinese restaurant. Could you tell me the different features of Chinese food? [Person2]:  Generally speaking, Beijing food is a bit oily. Shanghai food is rather light and Hunan dishes are very spicy. [Person1]:  Chinese dishes are delicious. They have a very nice color, too. [Person2]:  Would you like some dessert? [Person1]:  No, thanks. I'm quite full. [Person2]:  Did you enjoy the meal? [Person1]:  It's the most delicious dinner I've ever had. [Person2]:  I'm so glad you like it.
[Person1]:  Could you give me something for the pain? I couldn't get to sleep until 3 o'clock this morning. [Person2]:  Aspirin is the strongest medicine I can give you. [Person1]:  That isn't strong enough, and I don't have to meet my doctor until next week. [Person2]:  Who is your doctor? [Person1]:  Dr. Hilary. [Person2]:  Doesn't he have his office on the corner? [Person1]:  Yes, he does. [Person2]:  Are you a regular patient? [Person1]:  Yes. [Person2]:  Oh. Then I can call him if you like. Dr. Hilary will give me a pain treatment over the phone. [Person1]:  I'd appreciate that very much. Do you think that he'll still be in his office? [Person2]:  Sure. It's only 4
[Person1]:  Thank God! I am finished writing that service guide! It took me forever! [Person2]:  When did you finish? [Person1]:  This morning! No more overtime, and no more headaches! [Person2]:  Well, I ' m glad to hear it. Have a cup of coffee!
[Person1]:  Mr.  [Person2]:  Hi. [Person1]:  Mr.  [Person2]:  OK. [Person1]:  Mr.  [Person2]:  It's huge! [Person1]:  Mr.  [Person2]:  There must be about 50 computers in here. [Person1]:  Mr.  [Person2]:  Do I have to take gym? [Person1]:  Mr. 
[Person1]:  Excuse me, I wonder if you could help me? [Person2]:  Of course, what can I do for you? [Person1]:  Well, I hate to have to say this, but I'm not happy with my room. [Person2]:  Oh, what exactly is problem? [Person1]:  Well, the traffic is very loud. I got no sleep last night. [Person2]:  Oh, I'm so sorry, Sir. I'll see what I can do about that.
[Person1]:  Can I help you, madam? [Person2]:  Yes, I'm looking for a new winter coat. [Person1]:  Have you any particular color in mind? [Person2]:  I don't know really. What's the fashional color this year? [Person1]:  Red is very popular. [Person2]:  Good. Red suits me very well. It's a cheerful color, isn't it? [Person1]:  Yes, madam, I agree. What size are you? [Person2]:  Well, I used to be size fourteen, but I've put on a bit of weight recently, so may be sixteen. [Person1]:  Here you are, madam. All these are sixteens. [Person2]:  I quite like this one. How much is it? [Person1]:  It's $ 180. [Person2]:  Oh, that's too expensive. Aren't there any cheaper ones? [Person1]:  These are our cheapest coats, madam. [Person2]:  Yes, I see. I'll take it. Here's $ 200. [Person1]:  Here's your change. [Person2]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  Hello. I would like to buy some business cards. [Person2]:  Excellent. How many would you like? [Person1]:  Two thousand would be fine. [Person2]:  You need to fill out this form, please. [Person1]:  All I want is the same thing on this card. [Person2]:  That will be no problem, sir. [Person1]:  . . . Okay, I'm finished. Here's your form and my old card. [Person2]:  Very good, sir. Your order will be ready in one week. [Person1]:  Do you think you could finish it in three days? [Person2]:  No problem, sir. But it will cost you extra.
[Person1]:  Oh, the clothes here are so expensive! No wonder there are few people. [Person2]:  Beauty costs, dear! What do you think of this dress? Do you think it suits me? [Person1]:  Yeah, it's lovely, but to be frank, it's not the most practical. You don't have many formal events in your calendar, do you? [Person2]:  Come on, you sound like my Mom. Look at it, it's beautiful! [Person1]:  When you buy clothes, you must think about the material, quality and price. [Person2]:  Maybe you have a point. [Person1]:  Make sure you buy what you need and your clothes can be worn for various occasions. [Person2]:  All right. How about this black skirt? It can be worn for anything---a party, a job interview and even a funeral! [Person1]:  That's true, but you already have two back coats and one black sweater. [Person2]:  Oh! Hey, look, that's the same shirt Britney wore in her concert. [Person1]:  Exactly! Oh, my god! I love Britney! I'm going to get it. [Person2]:  Why not try it on? [Person1]:  It's just the right size--a perfect fit! I'll take it. Oh, no, I'm a little short. Did you bring your credit card? [Person2]:  Yes. [Person1]:  I promise I'll pay you back as soon as we get home.
[Person1]:  Can't you do something about the service in this hotel, manager? [Person2]:  I'm sorry madam. What's the problem exactly? [Person1]:  My breakfast, that's the problem. [Person2]:  Yes? [Person1]:  I ordered breakfast from room service. Oh, at least half an hour ago. [Person2]:  Yes? [Person1]:  I've telephoned room service three times, but my breakfast still hasn't come. [Person2]:  I see. [Person1]:  I've got an important meeting at nine o'clock. And now it seems I'll have to go there without breakfast. Really, I don't think this is good e-nough. [Person2]:  I'm very sorry about this, Madam. You ordered breakfast half an hour ago and you've phoned three times since then. [Person1]:  That's right. [Person2]:  I'm really sorry about that. You should have received your breakfast no later than five or ten minutes after you'd ordered it. [Person1]:  That's what I thought. [Person2]:  The problem may be that they are short of people in the kitchens recently. But I'll look into this. And I'll make sure that the breakfast is sent to you immediately. Full English breakfast, was it? [Person1]:  Yes. Full English breakfast. [Person2]:  Very well, madam. I'll deal with this myself and I'll have it sent up to your room right away.
[Person1]:  Do you have any experience working with a computer? [Person2]:  Yes. I have been a data entry operator for three years. [Person1]:  What kind of software can you use? [Person2]:  I have working knowledge of Windows and Dos. Actually, I'm quite familiar with both Java and C Programming Languages. [Person1]:  Do you have any other computer qualifications? [Person2]:  I have an ACRE certificate, GRADE 2. [Person1]:  Do you know how to use a PC to process the management information? [Person2]:  I'm sorry to say I'm not familiar with processing management information, but I'm sure I could learn quite quickly. It can't be too difficult, and I've got a quick mind. I can handle any problem you give me.
[Person1]:  I'm afraid I must be going now. [Person2]:  Must you? It's still early. [Person1]:  I'm afraid I really must. I have to meet a midnight plane. [Person2]:  In that case, we can't keep you. [Person1]:  Well, thank you very much for a pleasant evening. [Person2]:  Thank you for coming. You must come again. [Person1]:  Thank you. I will. Good-bye. [Person2]:  Good-bye. I wish you a very good journey home.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, madam. I'm wondering if you could tell me the place where I can repair my shoes. [Person2]:  There's one on Fifth Street. [Person1]:  Thank you, but how far is it to that store? [Person2]:  Not very far and not difficult to find. Just keep walking and after two blocks you will see a supermarket on your left. The store is next to the supermarket. [Person1]:  Oh, thank you very much. [Person2]:  You're welcome. You won't miss it,young man.
[Person1]:  Time to eat! [Person2]:  Coming. Oh, I'm starving. [Good, good.] Oh yuck! What's that? [Person1]:  Ah, now don't complain! [Person2]:  But what is it, and where is mom? [Person1]:  Now, mom put me in charge of dinner because she's not feeling well tonight. [Person2]:  But what is it ... and that smell! [Person1]:  It's pizza. I just followed an old family recipe here, and ... [Person2]:  Let me see that ... Oh, Dad. [What?] You're missing a page! [Person1]:  Oh, uh, well, uh ... well I couldn't find the second page of the recipe, but don't worry. I have plenty of experience around the house. Plenty of experience cooking. [Person2]:  That's not what mom says. [Person1]:  Well, wait, wait, here let me try a piece first. Here, let me, let me cool this off here. Ohhh, yeah. Oh, this is great stuff. [Person2]:  Yeah right. Why are you making that face? [Person1]:  Well, well, it's just, just a little rich for me. That's all. [Person2]:  Let me try it Dad. Uh. Dad. You put a little too much salt in it and besides it's burned. [Well ... ] And what's that? [Person1]:  Oh, well, well, that's just part of my own adaptation to the recipe. I added some pumpkin. [Person2]:  Oh, not another one of your surprises. Pumpkin doesn't go on pizza! [Person1]:  Well, okay, well, so what? Uh, what do we do now? [Person2]:  Well, how about some cold cereal ... You can't mess up on that, Dad.
[Person1]:  Good evening, Pizza House. This is Marty speaking. May I take your order?  [Person2]:  Um yes. I'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni, olives, and extra cheese.  [Person1]:  We have a two-for-one special on large pizzas. Would you like a large pizza instead?  [Person2]:  Sure, that sounds good.  [Person1]:  Great! Would you like your second pizza to be the same as the first?  [Person2]:  No, make the second one with ham, pineapple and green peppers. Oh, and make it thin crust.  [Person1]:  Okay, thin crust. Your total is $21. 50 and yourorder will arrive in thirty minutes or it's free!  [Person2]:  Perfect. Thank you. Bye. .  [Person1]:  wait! ! I need your address! 
[Person1]:  Who's that?  [Person2]:  Saint Jude-he's the saint of lost causes. Like my cousin, Anna, who can't stop getting pregnant. She's a lost cause.  [Person1]:  Is that your cousin in the back?  [Person2]:  Yep. She's always got a bun in the oven. She was pregnant before marriage-a real sin in the Catholic Church.  [Person1]:  What about birth control pills? Don't they work on Italians?  [Person2]:  Ha-ha. Birth control and abortion are four-letter words in my family.  [Person1]:  And I heard that Italian men have very active libidos. 
[Person1]:  What's the bonus like at your company?  [Person2]:  Well, it's OK, I suppose. We get about the equivalent of six months' salary.  [Person1]:  Six months' salary? Are you serious ? That's incredible!  [Person2]:  Maybe. But you'd be amazed at how little's left after the credit companies have deducted their share from my account.  [Person1]:  Hey, I know what that's like . I bought a BMW on my Visa card . Now the payments really hurt.  [Person2]:  Well, you're lucky that you're still able to make your payments. I missed a credit payment last month. Now my bank account's overdrawn , and the company is threatening to take back my purchases.  [Person1]:  What did you buy?  [Person2]:  A new home health monitor.  [Person1]:  Health Monitor? I read an article about that racket. They're overpriced to begin with! Listen, if I were you , I'd let them take back their monitor and spend my money on something more practical.  [Person2]:  You're kidding !  [Person1]:  No joke!  [Person2]:  That's something else! Maybe I'll return it to them. 
[Person1]:  Hey, Robbie. You're completely wet and covered with powder. So many colors! I mean, you look like a rainbow. What happened? [Person2]:  I've just come back from visiting my family. You know, we're from India and today is our Spring Festival Day. We call it Holly. [Person1]:  That's all very interesting. But I still don't understand why you look like that? [Person2]:  Well, we celebrate Holly by throwing colored powder and colored water at each other. And we light big fires, too, to show thanks to the gods. [Person1]:  Interesting. But aren't you afraid that you'll catch a cold and get ill? I mean, you're completely wet. [Person2]:  Actually, the things we throw at each other helped to keep us healthy. [Person1]:  What do you mean? [Person2]:  Well, the colored powders we throw are made from traditional Indian medicines. [Person1]:  And the coloured water, too? [Person2]:  The coloured water comes from the yellow flowers called Palash, and they're good for you, too. [Person1]:  Amazing. It sounds like a lot of fun. [Person2]:  It really is. Next year, if you're interested, I'll bring you along. [Person1]:  That would be great. I'll make sure I keep February second free. [Person2]:  Actually, Holly isn't like Christmas. The date changes from year to year. It's always celebrated at the end of the winter season, on the last full moon day of the month. [Person1]:  OK, just let me know when it is. Anyway, you'd better go inside and get changed.
[Person1]:  What time do you usually get up in the morning? [Person2]:  I sleep in every morning, sometimes until 11 or 12. [Person1]:  Are you serious? I get up at 5 [Person2]:  Well, I work from home. So I can set my own hours. I usually work until midnight or one in the morning and then I like to sleep in. [Person1]:  I like to be in bed around 9 [Person2]:  And I'm definitely a night person. Waking up early is so terrible. [Person1]:  Maybe we should switch schedules for a week. [Person2]:  No way. I would never want your schedule. [Person1]:  Very funny. What are you doing today? [Person2]:  Well, it's Saturday so I was thinking of taking a hike. Would you like to come? [Person1]:  Sure. Can we go to see a movie afterwards? [Person2]:  I don't really like movies actually. Can we do something else? [Person1]:  Sure, but I have to work tomorrow even though it's Sunday. So I do need to be home around 9
[Person1]:  Are you going to vote? [Person2]:  Of course! Are you? [Person1]:  I plan to, but what day is the election? [Person2]:  You should know that. [Person1]:  Can you just tell me? [Person2]:  The election is this Tuesday. [Person1]:  Are you serious? [Person2]:  I ' m not kidding. [Person1]:  It ' s a good thing I asked you. [Person2]:  That should ' Ve been something you knew already. [Person1]:  I couldn ' t remember. [Person2]:  Whatever. Just make sure you go vote.
[Person1]:  I am so happy to know that the promotion campaign for our new product is very successful. We just made a record sale this season. [Person2]:  That is very encouraging news. I heard that the marketing department has done a three months research, they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month. That is to say, the R & D center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market. [Person1]:  It is not an easy job. How do you like the advertisement for the new product? [Person2]:  That is the best one I have seen. I am sure our target customers, young people will love it. [Person1]:  Certainly.
[Person1]:  This is the good life! We have it good don't you think? [Person2]:  Yeah of course! Although, don't you ever wonder what ' could have been '? [Person1]:  What do you mean? [Person2]:  Well, sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things a little differently. [Person1]:  For example? [Person2]:  Like for example, if I hadn't studied architecture, I would have become an artist like I wanted to. [Person1]:  I see. Yeah now that I think of it, I wouldn't have gotten married if I hadn't moved to this town and met Sally. [Person2]:  You see! Everything happens for a reason! We wouldn't even have met if I hadn't been in that car accident ten years ago! [Person1]:  Well, I have no regrets! [Person2]:  I'll drink to that!
[Person1]:  Veronica! Veronica! Veronica! Are you OK?  [Person2]:  Steven! What's going on! Who were those guys? I didn't know you have a gun! What's going on!  [Person1]:  I will come clean as soon as we get to safety, OK? For now, you have to trust me, please! I would never do anything to hurt you.  [Person2]:  Steven, I. . .  [Person1]:  I haven't been completely honest with you Veronica, I'm sorry. I'm not a fireman. I'm not even from the United States. I'm a spy for the Indian government.  [Person2]:  What? Why didn't you tell me before? What are you doing here?  [Person1]:  When I was a young boy, I used to play cricket my father back in my hometown of Hyderabad. It was a peaceful town, and my father was a renowned chemist. One day, he was approached by members of the CIA, claiming that my father had made the discovery of the millennium in his small lab back at the university where he taught bio-chemistry. I never saw him again. I vowed to discover the whereabouts of my father and consequently joined the Indian Intelligence Bureau.  [Person2]:  What does that have to do with those men shooting at us? Most importantly, why did you lie to me!  [Person1]:  I'm sorry, I wasn't supposed to meet you. I wasn't supposed to fall in love with you, but you have to believe me when I tell you that what I feel for you is real.  [Person2]:  I can't believe this! Why are all these things happening to me! I can't take it anymore! Let me out of the car!  [Person1]:  Veronica, wait! 
[Person1]:  Hi, Bob! How are you doing? [Person2]:  Fine! How are you? [Person1]:  I'm fine too, thank you. [Person2]:  I've come to tell you I'm going to the concert this evening. Will you come with me? I've two complimentary tickets. [Person1]:  With the greatest pleasure. Where is the concert this evening? [Person2]:  It will be held at the Music Hall. [Person1]:  What's on the program? [Person2]:  It's a piano recital. I'm fond of piano, you know.
[Person1]:  I'm afraid we can't increase salary this year, money is just too tight. [Person2]:  I'm not sure. I can't agree, dan. [Person1]:  Why not? [Person2]:  Surely, there are other ways to save money. [Person1]:  What are you talking about, we've tried everything!
[Person1]:  Forest Restaurant. What can I do for you? [Person2]:  May I make a reservation? [Person1]:  Of course. At what time? [Person2]:  The four of us will be there at 7 [Person1]:  OK, sir. We are looking forward to your arrival.
[Person1]:  Ann, it's terrible! [Person2]:  What's up? [Person1]:  Look, this is a pimple! [Person2]:  Oh, I think it is. [Person1]:  How come? [Person2]:  I think it's because of your bad habits! [Person1]:  I have no bad habit. I sleep eight hours a day, never eat spicy food, clean the face twice a day and so on. I have done a lot. [Person2]:  I know you have done a lot, but you always sleep very late. Sleeping eight hours a day doesn't mean it is healthy. Sleeping after 12 is hurtful to our body, and I think this is your problem. [Person1]:  I wasn't aware of that! [Person2]:  You should do better later.
[Person1]:  Welcome to Lincoln Bank. How may we be of service? [Person2]:  Hi. We'd like to open a Foreign Currency Account, please. [Person1]:  OK, do you have the relevant materials?

[Person1]:  Hey, Taxi. Over here!  [Person2]:  Did you call for a car service  [Person1]:  Yes, are you engaged  [Person2]:  Not at the moment. Where would you like me to take you  [Person1]:  I am going to the airport, and I have to catch the 930 flight to New York.  [Person2]:  Well, it's a long way and there is roadwork near Broadway. I am not sure I can snake it in half an hour.  [Person1]:  But I can't miss the flight. It's an important meeting and it's waiting for me.  [Person2]:  All right, I will try my best. If there aren't any holdups, I think we can get there in time.  [Person1]:  That's great. How much is it to the airport  [Person2]:  About $25, tips not included.  [Person1]:  Fine. Will you please help me with the luggage  [Person2]:  Oh, yes, sure. Let me put it in the boot.  [Person1]:  Thanks very much.  [Person2]:  Not at all. Bang the door, please.  [Person1]:  Ok, let's hurry.  [Person2]:  You are in luck. The traffic is not heavy today. 
[Person1]:  My mother and my wife are always holding different ideas.  [Person2]:  If you are really in love with your wife, you should be in support of her. You can't have it both ways, of course.  [Person1]:  You mean I should please her by following her suggestion.  [Person2]:  Yeah. Love me, and love my dog. 
[Person1]:  Hello, Bessie.  [Person2]:  Hello, Jack. Happy birthday!  [Person1]:  My birthday? I forgot it, Thank you for remembering my birthday.  [Person2]:  I'd like to offer you my congratulations on your birthday and best wishes for your future happiness, good health and continued success. I've asked the Fairy Flowers to send you a bunch of flowers. I hope you'll like them.  [Person1]:  Thanks a lot. I'm so touched.  [Person2]:  Now let me sing 'Happy birthday' for you.  [Person1]:  Thank you very much. 
[Person1]:  What do you do for a living?  [Person2]:  I'm a doctor.  [Person1]:  Really? Do you like it?  [Person2]:  Yes, I do. It's very interesting. What's your job?  [Person1]:  I'm a bus driver.  [Person2]:  Oh, do you enjoy it?  [Person1]:  No, I don't really like it. It's boring. 
[Person1]:  Does this bus really go to the mall? [Person2]:  It goes all the way there. [Person1]:  Are you sure? [Person2]:  I know it does. I take this bus a lot. [Person1]:  How long does the bus take to get there? [Person2]:  The bus ride is only 30 minutes or so. [Person1]:  Where do we get off the bus? [Person2]:  Right behind Macy's is a bus stop. [Person1]:  The stop is really at the mall? [Person2]:  It's in the middle of the parking lot. [Person1]:  That's perfect.
[Person1]:  That's really convenient. We were wondering if you could take a little off the rent, though. [Person2]:  I can take two thousand off. That'll make the rent twenty-eight thousand. [Person1]:  That's great. Every little bit counts. And we don't need the parking space. I guess we could rent it out. [Person2]:  Sure, for at least three thousand per month. [Person1]:  That'll bring the price down to twenty-five. That's the price we were shooting for. [Person2]:  I'm glad. Now, there's a deposit fee of two month's rent.
[Person1]:  Good evening, Mr. Lee and thank you for choosing our airline. We have just discovered that this flight is overbooked. Would you like to volunteer to give up your seat? [Person2]:  Overbooked? Give up my seat? I don ' t understand. [Person1]:  From time to time we have a situation in which there are more passengers than there are seats on the aircraft. That ' s overbooked. [Person2]:  I know what overbooked is, I just don ' t understand how that could happen? [Person1]:  Actually it ' s a common practice to overbook, as passengers often don ' t take their flight as scheduled. Most of the time there is no problem but today, more passengers arrived than we have seats, [Person2]:  So who has to stay behind? [Person1]:  Well, first we ask for volunteers. If someone like yourself volunteers, they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year. If no one volunteers we just have to select someone. [Person2]:  Ok. I ' ll volunteer. I could use a free ticket!
[Person1]:  How do I know what forms to fill out for unemployment? [Person2]:  There is a special form to apply for unemployment benefits. [Person1]:  How do I get the form to apply for unemployment benefits? [Person2]:  You can go online to begin the application process. [Person1]:  What type of information will I have to provide to the Employment Development Office? [Person2]:  You need to be able to say whom you worked for and when. [Person1]:  Will they need anything else from me? [Person2]:  You should be able to provide a layoff notice or proof of severance. [Person1]:  What should I do after I turn in the application? [Person2]:  You need to be interviewed over the phone. They will set up a time for you.
[Person1]:  This is the menu. What would you like to have? [Person2]:  I don't know what to have. If you don't mind, I'll just leave the choice to you. [Person1]:  With pleasure, sir. May I suggest Steamed stuffed buns and deep-fried twisted dough sticks? They are popular breakfast among Chinese people. [Person2]:  OK. Anything to drink? [Person1]:  Yes, sir. We usually serve soya-bean milk and jellied beancurd. Which one do you prefer, sir? A [Person2]:  I'll try the soya-bean milk this time. [Person1]:  So, that's steamed stuffed buns and deep-fried twisted dough sticks, and a Soya-bean milk. [Person2]:  That's right. [Person1]:  Thank you, sir. Just a moment, please.
[Person1]:  How many people are there in your family? [Person2]:  My immediate family is quite small. It's just my older step-brother, my mom, my step-dad and me. how about you? [Person1]:  I have a large family. I have three older sisters, my twin sister, a younger brother, and parents. [Person2]:  I didn't know you were a twin! Are you identical or fraternal? [Person1]:  We're identical. I mean, we look exactly the same, but we are complete opposites when it comes to everything else. [Person2]:  Interesting. It must be great having a twin sister. Are you best friends, too? [Person1]:  We used to be really close, but that all changed once she moved to Shanghai. How about your family? You didn't mention to your biological father. [Person2]:  I don't know much about him. He died when I was just a baby. Even though I don't have a blood relationship with my step-father and step-brother, I consider them to be my real family. [Person1]:  What about your step-brother's mother? Does he keep in touch with her? [Person2]:  No, she also died when my step-brother was little. My mother and my step-father met each other shortly after my father died and became good friends. They ended up getting married a few years later. [Person1]:  Sounds like it was meant to be.
[Person1]:  Have you been ever been to Disneyworld? [Person2]:  When I was young, my parents took me to the one in California. I always forget which, is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld? [Person1]:  The one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland, so you must have been to Disneyland. [Person2]:  That's right. Why do you ask? [Person1]:  Well, I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon. [Person2]:  When are getting married? [Person1]:  Some time next year. We haven't set the date yet. [Person2]:  Congratulations! I had no idea. [Person1]:  Thank you. So what do you think? Would we have a good time? [Person2]:  Do you like amusement parks? [Person1]:  For the most part, yes. Some of the rides are bit too scary for me, though. [Person2]:  If you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can, you'll have a good time. [Person1]:  Even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark? [Person2]:  Even those. It'll be very romantic, I think. You'll have loads of fun. [Person1]:  Thanks for the advice. I'll talk to my fiance about it tonight. [Person2]:  I'm sure he'll love the idea. Just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it!
[Person1]:  Greg. I want to speak to you for a minute. [Person2]:  Yes. Ms. Gray. Is there something wrong? [Person1]:  I'm afraid there is, Greg. I don't mind you taking a break. But you'Ve been away from your desk for twenty-five minutes already. [Person2]:  I'm sorry, Ms. Gray. I must have lost track of the time. I'll get back to work, now.
[Person1]:  Do you like cooking?  [Person2]:  Yes , I do it a lot. but I don't like doing dishes. what about you, do you like cooking and then cleaning up afterwards?  [Person1]:  To be honest, I don't really like doing either one , I can't cook and I hate cleaning.  [Person2]:  Suppose you have to do one of the two, which do you prefer?  [Person1]:  I would rather do the dishes than cook.  [Person2]:  I prefer the absent. the way I see it , to do the dishes is boring.  [Person1]:  let's make a deal.  [Person2]:  What?  [Person1]:  I'm going to buy some vegetable and you cook.  [Person2]:  Will you do the dishes after the meal?  [Person1]:  Fair enough! 
[Person1]:  Good morning, everybody. Welcome to IAM Technology. I'm very pleased so many of you could make it here today. My name's Sam Weiss. I'm the Production Manager. I'd like to show you the layout of the factory before we go and visit it. As you can see from this diagram, everything is under one roof. We've designed it this way to help the flow of materials and to avoid bottlenecks. [Person2]:  This area here is where we keep our raw materials. The main production area - our machine hall - is situated next to it. Maintenance is situated between the stores and the production area. Just to the right of Maintenance, there are steps up to the Lab and the Admin Section. Process Control is also on the upper level. It's located above the factory floor so that the operators can monitor everything that is going on below.
[Person1]:  Good morning. sir. How may I serve you today? [Person2]:  I'd like a cup of mocha. [Person1]:  Sure. Large or medium? [Person2]:  Medium, please. [Person1]:  Anything else to go?

[Person1]:  What seems to be the problem, kid? [Person2]:  I've got a sore throat, a runny nose and a headache. [Person1]:  Ah. . . How long have you been like this? [Person2]:  I am not very sure. Maybe for three days. [Person1]:  Do you have any stomachache? [Person2]:  I guess so. It comes and goes. [Person1]:  Open your mouth and say ah. . . God, you are suffering from the swelling of tonsils. [Person2]:  Is that serious, doctor? [Person1]:  Yes, I am sure that you got the flu. You need a shot. [Person2]:  Oh, doctor. Do I have to? I am afraid of needles! [Person1]:  Yes, that's for sure. But it is not that bad. It's gonna be all right. [Person2]:  Oh, doctor, please. . . [Person1]:  Be brave, young man. Only girls cry when given an injection. [Person2]:  You are right. I won't cry anymore.
[Person1]:  You must be very busy these days. I heard you are responsible for the meeting arrangements this time. It can be the most important meeting for our company this year. [Person2]:  Sure it is. I am up to my ears as time expressed. [Person1]:  Do we still use the conference room in the same hotel as last time? You remember? I like that one. [Person2]:  If we were in the same conference room, I would not work late these days. That conference room has been booked out. This time our boss wants to hold the meeting in our company. So everything has to be rearranged and checked, like tables, chairs, mean tacks, podium, audio and visual equipments and even the lunch menu. [Person1]:  Good preparation will improve the effectiveness of the meeting. I am sure that your hard work will pay off.
[Person1]:  So, now we have covered all the important points. [Person2]:  Yes, I think so. [Person1]:  Before we draft the contract, let's examine the details. [Person2]:  Ok, under this contract, we'll supply you with 600 dozen T-shirts, S, M and L equally assorted, at USD 100 per dozen, CFR London. Shipment in July. Payment by irrevocable sight LC. [Person1]:  Perfect. But what I'm concerned about most is the time of delivery . [Person2]:  You may rest assured that shipment will be effected within the time limits stipulated in the contract. But there is also one point I'd like to stress. [Person1]:  Yes? [Person2]:  Your LC must be opened at least onemonth before the time shipment, otherwise we won't be able to catch the ship. [Person1]:  No problem. I'll have the covering LC opened as soon as I wetback. In addition, would you tell me by whom the commodity inspection is conducted before shipment? [Person2]:  The goods will be inspected by the China Import & Export Commodity Inspection Bureau. It will then issue certificate of quality and a certificate of weight. These will be taken as final and biding. [Person1]:  Please remember to use both English and Chinese versions and both versions should be equally valid. [Person2]:  Naturally. Each of us keeps one original and two copies. [Person1]:  Then I'll come along three days later to put my signature on it. [Person2]:  Good.
[Person1]:  How do you like Hong Kong, Mr. Green? [Person2]:  Very much. [Person1]:  Are you staying at a hotel? [Person2]:  Yes, at the Star Hotel, next door to this building. [Person1]:  Oh, yes. [Person2]:  It's nearly one o'clock! I'm hungry. Is there a good restaurant nearby? [Person1]:  Yes, there are several. Would you like to eat Chinese food or European? [Person2]:  Er, European, I think. But would you like to have lunch with me? [Person1]:  Well, thank you. I'd like to. [Person2]:  Good, would you like to choose a better restaurant? [Person1]:  Well, there's Brown's. The food's very good, but I'm afraid it's rather expensive. [Person2]:  That's all right, Miss Jiang. Shall we go, then?
[Person1]:  Why, Tom. You look pale. What's wrong with you? [Person2]:  Nothing serious. I haven't had much exercise lately, I'm very busy. What do you do in your spare time? [Person1]:  I often go to ball games. [Person2]:  What's your favorite sport? [Person1]:  My favorite summer sport is swimming, and my favorite winter sport is skating. I also like watching track events and gymnastics. You have a favorite sport, don't you? [Person2]:  My favorite sport is tennis, but I can't play it well. [Person1]:  I like tennis, too. There is a tennis match at our school tomorrow morning. Do you want to go? [Person2]:  I'm sorry to say I can't. I want to watch TV. It's a live broadcast of the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games. It will be very exciting. [Person1]:  All right. By the way, you should pay more attention to your health. You must have more exercise in your free time. [Person2]:  Thank you very much. I will.
[Person1]:  Look. Jack! That man fell off the ladder. Come and help! He must be injured. [Person2]:  He's not moving. Shall we take him to the hospital? [Person1]:  We mustn't move him. Leave him where he is. [Person2]:  We must get help. I'll go to that phone box and call the First Aid Center. [Person1]:  Right. I'll stay here with him. [Person2]:  How is he now? [Person1]:  He's still not moving, but he's breathing. His head must be hurt. [Person2]:  The First Aid Center says they are coming soon. [Person1]:  Let's wait until help comes. Look, there they come!
[Person1]:  What do you think of my new painting? I've just finished it. [Person2]:  Well, the colors are a little strange, don't you think? [Person1]:  Ah, yes. That's the point. It's called Colors. [Person2]:  Oh, yes, I see. Well, it's not quite my cup of tea - but then we all have different tastes, don't we?
[Person1]:  Morning, Mary. I haven't seen you in a long time. What's up?  [Person2]:  Oh, I took up a new hobby.  [Person1]:  So you don't travel a lot now?  [Person2]:  No, Frank. I'm much more interestcd in collecting stamps now.  [Person1]:  It's certainly a popular hobby. I know a lot of people love stamps.  [Person2]:  It certainly is. It's so much fun.  [Person1]:  I believe collecting stamps has something similar to traveling right?  [Person2]:  Absolutely. Through all kinds of stamps I am able to learn about the world.  [Person1]:  Well, every stamp has a story to tell.  [Person2]:  You're right. And I also meet many new friends while collecting stamps.  [Person1]:  Good.  [Person2]:  Sometimes we even spend hours discussing our collcctions.  [Person1]:  There's a lot to share when you have a common interest.  [Person2]:  Yes, it's really amazing. I got to go now. I'm meeting with some other collectors.  [Person1]:  Ok, good luck. See you  [Person2]:  See you, Frank. 
[Person1]:  I haven't seen your father in like 5 years. How is he doing?  [Person2]:  He's not doing too well.  [Person1]:  Why? What's wrong?  [Person2]:  About a year ago, he started feeling weak all the time.  [Person1]:  Is it due to old age or is he sick.  [Person2]:  Maybe a little of both. The doctor's can't point out anything specifically. I think it is because he didn't take care of himself during his youth.  [Person1]:  That makes sense. It's important to take care of your health early in life.  [Person2]:  That's what my father tells me almost everyday.  [Person1]:  Well, I hope he starts feeling better. Say hi to him for me.  [Person2]:  Thanks. I'll let him know. 
[Person1]:  Sandy. Do you have a minute?  [Person2]:  Yes, John. I'm on my break. What's going on?  [Person1]:  Not much. I just wanted to see how you were. How's married life treating you?  [Person2]:  Great, except for my mother-in-law! Sometimes I think I married her instead of my husband! How about you? 
[Person1]:  Bruce, I think it's time to go and meet Pam at the airport. [Person2]:  Oh no, we have no need to hurry. There's plenty of time. It's only 8 [Person1]:  You never know. And I think your watch must be slow. I make it 8 [Person2]:  It'll take her a while to get her luggage. [Person1]:  Oh, come on, Bruce. It's time to leave. We can always have coffee at the airport. Anyway, I like watching people at the airport. [Person2]:  I'd rather see the end of the football match, but never mind. We better go.
[Person1]:  Do you have anything to declare? [Person2]:  I have a camera and three bottles of whisky. [Person1]:  OK. You'll have to pay duty for the whisky. [Person2]:  Well, where shall I pay the duty for the whisky? [Person1]:  Please wait a moment. I'll make out the duty memo. Here you are. Take this and pay the people over there. [Person2]:  I've paid the duty. Here is the receipt [Person1]:  Very well. I hope you'll enjoy your stay in China. [Person2]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  I'm searching for an old music box. [Person2]:  You came to the right place. Any particular decade? [Person1]:  If you had a box made in the ' 20s, that would be nice. [Person2]:  We just got one in yesterday, so now we have six. [Person1]:  Would any of them have dancing figures? [Person2]:  Yes, we still have two boxes left that have dancing figures. [Person1]:  Oh, they're both so beautiful. Let me have this one, I think. [Person2]:  That one truly is a beautiful piece of work, isn't it? [Person1]:  One last question [Person2]:  Oh, no. Everything we sell here is ' as is. ' [Person1]:  I guess I was asking for too much. [Person2]:  If it breaks down, maybe you can find a repairman on the Internet.
[Person1]:  Good morning. Are you Mr. Liu? [Person2]:  My name is Liu Lichi. How do you do? [Person1]:  How do you do? Please be seated, How is your trip here? [Person2]:  Quite good, I think. I came here by bus, and it took me about 15 minutes. [Person1]:  Oh, yes. How old are you? [Person2]:  Twenty. [Person1]:  Hum, still a student? [Person2]:  Yes, I'm student of grade 3 in the university majoring in economics. [Person1]:  What subjects are you studying? [Person2]:  English, math, commercial and legal studies, and accountancy. [Person1]:  Have you had any working experience. [Person2]:  Well, I worked at a supermarket during last summer holidays. [Person1]:  What do you like to do in your spare time? [Person2]:  I like sports very much. Besides that, I also like working on a computer in my spare time. [Person1]:  How are your English and computer skills? [Person2]:  I have passed the CET - 4 and 6. As far as computer is concerned I can use the computer for word processing. [Person1]:  Okay. Mr. Liu, we'll inform you of the results within a week.
[Person1]:  Hi, Sarah. The results of questionnaire have come out. We need to discuss it together then write a research report. [Person2]:  How is the new product? [Person1]:  30 % of the people are attracted by the style. Buyers always pay great attention to packing. In my opinion, these goods didn't sell well merely because of the poor packing. [Person2]:  Yes, I think so. And how about the price? [Person1]:  Almost 30 % of the consumers can't accept the price. Maybe we should lower our price a little. [Person2]:  Yes, I agree with you. We should add our opinions to the research report. [Person1]:  Absolutely.
[Person1]:  You are quite busy every day. [Person2]:  Yes. Work starts at eight and I arrive home after six. [Person1]:  So you have to work all day. [Person2]:  I can take a break at lunch time, but it is only 30 minutes. [Person1]:  I see you sometimes work on weekends, too. [Person2]:  Yes, I really don't like it.
[Person1]:  I don't understand why you always look so happy, so energetic. It seems like you'Ve got good news everyday. [Person2]:  Really? Do I look happy all the time? [Person1]:  All I know is you look quite differently from other teachers. [Person2]:  Oh, do you know why? Actually, it's easy. Because I always exercise. My exercise, I think, is very hard. I often feel very good after conquering these difficulties. I feel alive! [Person1]:  Oh, I know. I saw you doing pull-ups one time on the campus and some students trying to imitate you. [Person2]:  Yeah, they are doing it for fun. Seldom would people like my exercise. It's difficult and boring. [Person1]:  It's true. Many students do the exercise when they have to. We have P. E. once a week. [Person2]:  But I think Chinese students need to exercise more. Besides exercise will help them learn new things better. Don't students want to have a good memory? [Person1]:  Of course. I didn't know that. I only know exercise makes bodies stronger. I should take some exercise then. Do you have any suggestions? [Person2]:  Well, do what you like to do. It can be anything. Jogging, doing aerobics, going bicycling, and playing ping-pong. Absolutely anything. Doing three or more workouts a week is good for you. But remember to do some stretches first. [Person1]:  Oh, I know. Thank you.
[Person1]:  Dad, can I have a pet? I did what you said and passed all of my exams. [Person2]:  Then I guess you get to have a pet. Do you know what you want? [Person1]:  I want a dog. My friend Mindy's dog just had puppies and she said I can have one. [Person2]:  You know who will be responsible for feeding and cleaning and all of that stuff? [Person1]:  I know, I know. I will do it all by myself. [Person2]:  Have you figured out the costs involved with feeding and caring for it? [Person1]:  Yes. It will cost me about $ 50 a month. And I make a little more than that already. [Person2]:  Sounds like you've done your homework. I think you're ready for this.
[Person1]:  Can you tell me how to reach the bank please? [Person2]:  Which bank? There are two, the Allied Irish Bank and the Bank of Ireland. [Person1]:  I have an AIR pass card and I want to withdraw money from the bank. [Person2]:  You need to go to the Allied Irish Bank which is near the local shopping centre, Dunned Stores. [Person1]:  How do I get there. I have no knowledge of this area. [Person2]:  Cross the road and turn left at the other side. Walk along the footpath until you reach the traffic lights. You will see a shopping centre on the right hand side. Walk across the road and turn right after the shopping centre. Keep going straight for about 100m and the bank is to your left. [Person1]:  It sounds very complicated. How far is it from here? [Person2]:  It's not so complicated. It's about five minutes walk from here. I can draw a map for you if you wish. [Person1]:  Oh, I would really appreciate that. By the way will I be going North or South? [Person2]:  You will be going northwards. You are now in the the Western part of the city and the Allied Irish Bank is situated in the North East. Here's a rough sketch of the area.
[Person1]:  Dad, can I go to a movie with Sharon? [Person2]:  Yeah, sure, but wait. Weren't you supposed to get a report card sometime this past week? [Person1]:  Well, oh yeah. Can I call Sharon now? [Person2]:  Uh-hum. You didn't answer my question. Did you receive it or not? [Person1]:  I love you Dad! You're the best! [Person2]:  Don't try to butter me up. I can guess that your answer means that you didn't do well in some of your classes? [Person1]:  Well, my English teacher is soooo boring, and he blows up every time someone talks. [Person2]:  In other words, you're not doing so well? [Person1]:  Uh, a C ... minus. [Person2]:  Oh. Well, how are you doing in your Spanish class? You said you liked that one. [Person1]:  Well, I do, but I forgot to turn in a couple of assignments, and I had problems on the last test. All those verbs tripped me up. I get them all mixed up in my head! [Person2]:  Okay, and what about algebra? [Person1]:  Ah, I'm acing that class. No sweat. [Person2]:  Oh! [Person1]:  Can I go now? [Person2]:  And how are you doing in history? [Person1]:  Oh, that's my favorite class. Mr. Jones is always passing out candy if you know the answers to his questions. [Person2]:  Great. Now, I have a bright daughter with tooth decay. [Person1]:  Ah, Dad. Can I go now? [Person2]:  You can go if you answer my history question. How old am I? [Person1]:  Uh, fifty-five? [Person2]:  Fifty-five! You just failed a math and history test at the same time! [Person1]:  Dad ... [Person2]:  Well, okay, but you need to come straight home from the movie, and you need to practice your clarinet. [Person1]:  Oh, I forgot about that grade? [Person2]:  What? [Person1]:  Gotta run, Dad.
[Person1]:  Hello. [Person2]:  Hi, Tom. This is Diana from the creative writing class. [Person1]:  Oh, hi, Diana. What's up? [Person2]:  Well, I have a new project which I thought you might be interested in. I'm setting up a writer's group, you know, a support group for people who are trying to get published. [Person1]:  Well, how would it work? [Person2]:  We get together once a week. I've already arranged for a meeting room in the library, and then we share what we were working on and offer each other some advice. [Person1]:  I could use some advice. I'm working on a short story that I'd like to get published in the Campus Literature Review. You've done that, haven't you? Didn't I see a poem of yours in the last issue? [Person2]:  Yes, I was so excited to finally see my work in print. It was presented three times. You just have to keep trying if they turn you down. [Person1]:  Well, I'm sure the group could help me, but I don't know how much I can contribute. I'm just starting out. [Person2]:  That's OK. I know from your comments in class that you will be a valuable member. We will get someone more experienced to help us, too. [Person1]:  Sounds great. You can definitely count me in.
[Person1]:  Are there any changes in this morning's program? [Person2]:  No, we'll go to Collin's garage sale; he has many books for sale. [Person1]:  There're so many books for sale in a flea market near this street, too. Why don't you go there? [Person2]:  What is a flea market? [Person1]:  It is not that different from other markets except that the goods there have been used before. [Person2]:  Are there any good books? [Person1]:  Of course. If you're lucky, you can find some rare and old ones. [Person2]:  It sounds like a good place and we should go there.
[Person1]:  You don't look very happy. What seems to be the problem? [Person2]:  I've got to write a long composition for my English class and I just can't come up with any idea and it's due tomorrow. [Person1]:  That shouldn't be too difficult. Remember those pictures you were showing me last week. The ones from your voyage last winter. [Person2]:  Sure, I've got them here some place. [Person1]:  Why don't you write about your impressions of the pyramids in Egypt and camel ride you took? [Person2]:  That sounds like a good idea. I can also tell about our visit to North Africa, the Holy Land and all of the historical places we visited. [Person1]:  Well, now that you're feeling better about this. I think I'll be on my way. I've got to finish my composition too. [Person2]:  Thanks for your help. Once I get organized, it won't be so difficult.
[Person1]:  Excuse me. You are Mr. Green from Manchester, aren't you? [Person2]:  Yes, I'm glad you recognized me. [Person1]:  A man with white hair and a beard, isn't that how you describe yourself in the telex? So it's easy to spot you in any crowd. Let me introduce myself. I am Tan Ling, source manager of Yellow River Import and Export Corporation. How do you do? [Person2]:  How do you do? [Person1]:  Well, Mr. Green, do you have any unaccompanied luggage? [Person2]:  No. I always travel with this bag or with small suitcase only. [Person1]:  Let's go then. This way to the front door. Let me carry your bag. [Person2]:  No, I wouldn't dream of letting a lady carry things for me. Surely I'm not so old as that yet. [Person1]:  Of course not. You look young and energetic in spite of your white hair, Mr. Green. [Person2]:  Thank you. I'm glad to hear that. [Person1]:  The car is waiting outside to take us to the hotel. I reserved a suite for you at the Phoenix, one of the biggest in Dublin. [Person2]:  Do you mean one of the largest suite or one of the biggest hotel? [Person1]:  Actually, both the hotel and the suite are rather big. But the biggest ones aren't always the best ones. [Person2]:  Quite true. [Person1]:  Mr. Green, just wait till you see the suite. You can change it for a better one if you don't happen to like it or move to another hotel if you like.
[Person1]:  How can I help you today? [Person2]:  I would like to rent a car. [Person1]:  Let's see what we can find. We have a large car, a mid-size car and a small car for you to choose from. What size are you looking for? [Person2]:  I'll be traveling in the city alone, so a small car is OK. How much is that a day? [Person1]:  A small car is $40 a day. How long will you be renting the car? [Person2]:  5 days. [Person1]:  OK. Can I see your driver's license and a credit card? [Person2]:  Sure, here you are. [Person1]:  Would you like me to put the charge on this card? [Person2]:  That will be fine.
[Person1]:  Excuse me sir, I'm a stranger here and have lost my way. [Person2]:  Where do you want to go? [Person1]:  I want to return to my hotel, the New York Hotel. [Person2]:  Go straight along this road, then go over the bridge and turn right at the book shop. You'll find your hotel. [Person1]:  Thank you, by the way, can you direct me to the Central Park? [Person2]:  Oh, it's so far from here, you can take the subway. [Person1]:  How long will it take me if I walk there? [Person2]:  It might take you 3/4 of an hour. [Person1]:  Well, where is the subway station? [Person2]:  You just turn left, and walk 3 blocks and you'll find it. [Person1]:  Where should I get off? [Person2]:  Get off at forty fifth street.
[Person1]:  Hello, I scheduled an appointment with Dr. Smith, and I can ' t make it on that day. [Person2]:  What day was your appointment on? [Person1]:  My appointment was on Monday. [Person2]:  What time had you chosen? [Person1]:  It was for 10 [Person2]:  I am looking at your appointment right now. What day would you prefer? [Person1]:  I would prefer next Thursday. [Person2]:  What time would be best for you? [Person1]:  I want to come in at 2 [Person2]:  I am writing you down for that time. We look forward to seeing you.
[Person1]:  Joe, how are you doing? [Person2]:  I am great! How about you, Mary? How are you? [Person1]:  I am doing great! Thank you for asking, Joe. [Person2]:  I was wondering if you want to go see a movie with me tonight? [Person1]:  I need to stay home tonight and finish my term paper. [Person2]:  OK. What about going to the movies on Friday night? [Person1]:  What were you planning on seeing? [Person2]:  I was thinking about seeing that one about the rapist serial killer. [Person1]:  How about ' The Secret Life of Bees '? [Person2]:  That's a chick flick!
[Person1]:  What's the problem, Nada? You look down in the dumps. [Person2]:  I don't know. My life is a big mess. Everything is so complicated. [Person1]:  come on, nothing can be that bad. [Person2]:  but promise me, you'll keep it a secret. [Person1]:  ok, I promise. So what's troubling you so much? [Person2]:  I've fallen in love with my boss. [Person1]:  really? Is he married? [Person2]:  no, of course not. He is still single. [Person1]:  then what's your problem? [Person2]:  I try to keep it to myself. But there is a lot of gossip about us. [Person1]:  oh, I see. Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip. [Person2]:  worse still, he is trying to avoid me these days. [Person1]:  office romance is very tricky. [Person2]:  it gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed. [Person1]:  cheer up, Nada. You'll be fine.
[Person1]:  You're home late today, David. How was school? [Person2]:  Not bad. There's a new English teacher. [Person1]:  Oh, what's she like? [Person2]:  She is beautiful. [Person1]:  Is she old or young? [Person2]:  She is quite young and her hair is blond. [Person1]:  Is she strict? [Person2]:  Not really. Her eyes are blue. [Person1]:  Can she speak Chinese? [Person2]:  Not much. She is very tall and slim. [Person1]:  David, stop dreaming. It's time to do your homework.
[Person1]:  What kind of note are you taking there. That looks like doodle to me. [Person2]:  It's picture association of the concept that the professor taught today. [Person1]:  Does that actually work for you? [Person2]:  I don't really know for sure yet. I'll tell you after the test on Friday. [Person1]:  I like to use shorthand note taking. [Person2]:  I was told once that the more time you spend writing, the less you are paying attention and so you miss stuff. [Person1]:  Hmm. I never thought about it that way. [Person2]:  One time I tried just listening, no notes, no pictures. I think I really learned more that day.
[Person1]:  David, what do you want to do after graduation? [Person2]:  I suppose I should choose one from the'Best Career List', to be a public officer, what do you think? [Person1]:  That sounds like a hot job, right? But in my opinion, you ought not to choose one career from that so-called list, and you need to take your interests, values, and skills into account. [Person2]:  It beats me! I never thought about it before and maybe I thought finding a career is a simple thing. [Person1]:  You'd better ask for suggestions from a career counselor, and then make a decision.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, which one is of the highest quality here? [Person2]:  This one. It is of the best quality and excellently tailored as well. You may try it on. [Person1]:  That is nice. But I don't quite like the collar. [Person2]:  The collar? It is just the collar that is popular with young people in Shanghai. [Person1]:  I don't care what others wear. How much is it? [Person2]:  250 Yuan. [Person1]:  Really? Too expensive. I don't think I can afford it. [Person2]:  But it is really worthwhile. [Person1]:  OK, anyway, let me have it. [Person2]:  Here you are. [Person1]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  I'm quite upset! I want a new room and a refund for tonight. [Person2]:  Forgive me, sir, I haven't been told what the problem is. [Person1]:  I'm about to be swept away by millions of cockroaches! [Person2]:  My apologies, sir. We'll transfer you to a new room at once and give you a full refund. [Person1]:  Thank you. I didn't want to have to take this to court. [Person2]:  Sir, we never want a guest to stay here mad or unhappy.
[Person1]:  are you ready for the meeting? [Person2]:  yes, come on in. how's your new job going? [Person1]:  it's challenging, but I'm enjoying it quite a bit. [Person2]:  that's great. I knew you'd do a good job as a manager. [Person1]:  thanks a lot. [Person2]:  how's your assistant manager getting on? [Person1]:  well, that's part of the problem. His probation period is up tomorrow and I don't think he's ready to pass. [Person2]:  what seems to be the problem? [Person1]:  well, he was supposed to be able to learn his job in 30 days, but he just doesn't seem to know what he's doing. [Person2]:  if you gave him another 30 days, do you think he could figure it out by then? [Person1]:  to be honest, he has no authority. He's a hard-worker, but no one listens to him. [Person2]:  I see. Not everyone is cut out to work in management. [Person1]:  I know. It'd be great if we could transfer him to a department where he doesn't have to work with people. [Person2]:  there's an opening in the creative design department. It involves working with computers. [Person1]:  that's perfect. I'll let him know tomorrow. Thanks!
[Person1]:  Mon and I got in another fight, Boris. [Person2]:  oh, Iris! what was it about this time? [Person1]:  it was over food. I simply wanted some fried chicken but she said no. [Person2]:  I believe she was right. You must know that fried foods contain a lot of fat. [Person1]:  oh, she keeps saying that. She never allows me to have them. [Person2]:  I think you'd better take her advice since health is the greatest wealth. [Person1]:  But, Boris, i am not a baby any more. [Person2]:  well, that's true. [Person1]:  how about your mother? [Person2]:  she also believes in healthy diet. And she requires us to have regular meals. [Person1]:  poor you. It seems we are in the same boat. [Person2]:  Oh, i am grateful for my mother on this point. her idea of healthy eating helps me a lot keeping fit. [Person1]:  really? so you don't have fried food at all. [Person2]:  not really. I may have some occasionally for a chance. But I don't indulge myself too much. [Person1]:  how do you manage it? [Person2]:  it's pretty simple, Iris. Just keep it in mind that you're what you eat.
[Person1]:  that was a great party. Thanks for saying behind to help me clear up. [Person2]:  it certainly was a great party. It's a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here. [Person1]:  I expected that something might get broken. That doesn't bother me. That spilled drink won't leave a stain, will it? [Person2]:  I doubt it, I ' ll deal with it right away. Luckily it wasn't a glass of red wine, I'll just get a bowl of water and a cloth. [Person1]:  I'm going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag. [Person2]:  afterwards, we can do the washing up together. Everything will be finished within an hour. Your friend Keith is really funny. I liked his magic tricks. [Person1]:  yes, he's very good. . isn't he? He told some funny stories too. [Person2]:  Amanda told some very funny jokes. At the beginning of the party, she was being ver serious. [Person1]:  I think that she had a litter too much of the punch. [Person2]:  what did you put in that punch? It tasted great, but was quite strong. [Person1]:  that's my little secret. Did you like the snacks and I prepared? [Person2]:  very much. The birthday cake was delicious, wasn't it? Emily told me that she and karen made it themselves. [Person1]:  that cake tasted so good! It disappeared within minutes, so I think everyone liked it a lot. How's that stain? [Person2]:  all cleaned up. Are you ready to start on the washing up.
[Person1]:  I'm sorry, sir. I'm going to have to ask you to leave. [Person2]:  What? I was just having a friendly conversation with the lady here. . . [Person1]:  Well, she apparently doesn't think it's so friendly. Let's go. [Person2]:  I think there's been a misunderstanding! [Person1]:  You'd better cooperate with me, sir, or. . . [Person2]:  OK! Just give her this for me!
[Person1]:  The government is going to organize a folk-custom activity at the end of the month. And our community is supposed to put on a performance. [Person2]:  What kind of performance? A lion dance? [Person1]:  Stuff like that but I think the lion dance is a bit too difficult and dangerous. [Person2]:  Sure, you'll be dancing with lions. What do you expect? Then what about Range Dance which we did before. [Person1]:  Good idea. Shall we get everyone in the community? [Person2]:  Maybe not. I think we should just focus on the retired people. [Person1]:  I know that they already have a Range Dance team and then what we need is just to do some rehearsals. [Person2]:  What about the costumes? [Person1]:  We can raise money in the community. You know each family 10 yuan maybe. [Person2]:  Try something new. We can find a supporting agency. [Person1]:  Great idea. There is a travel agency nearby who would love to be our sponsor. It's a perfect chance for them to promote ethnic tourism.
[Person1]:  What did her boss say to you? [Person2]:  He asked me to beef up in the work. [Person1]:  Yeah. You look so unhappy recently. What's the matter. [Person2]:  Nothing, thanks. I am just not in the mood these days.
[Person1]:  Would you like to order now? [Person2]:  This all looks good! I think we know what we want. [Person1]:  Please let me point out the chef's special, which is blackened catfish. [Person2]:  I am dieting, so could the chef prepare the food with no extra sauce? [Person1]:  We are always happy to adjust our cooking to meet your needs. [Person2]:  Could you tell me if there are any entrees that are vegetarian? [Person1]:  The cashew broccoli noodles or the cheese and veggie enchiladas would be an excellent choice. [Person2]:  I am going to go with the grilled shrimp with garlic sauce. I would like the garlic sauce on the side. [Person1]:  Would you like your salad brought to you with your entree, or would you like it served now? [Person2]:  You can serve our salads with our dinner.
[Person1]:  Oh, I am starving. [Person2]:  Me too. Shall we eat out? There is a new French restaurant down the street. [Person1]:  Oh, forget about it. I went there with a friend last week. The menu was all in French and I just couldn't read it. [Person2]:  That's what you are paying for. [Person1]:  Maybe. But I should say everything was expensive and nothing was to my satisfaction. [Person2]:  Then how about the Italian restaurant on the next block. [Person1]:  Well. I ate out almost every day last week. Let's just eat in today. [Person2]:  But I am not in the mood to cook. [Person1]:  I will cook then. In fact, I am sick and tired of restaurant. I just want a home-cook meal.
[Person1]:  Oh, Mrs. Smith. Can I take the test now? I just ..., oh. [Person2]:  Excuse me? What do you mean? The test ended 10 minutes ago, and you weren't there to take it. Sorry. [Person1]:  Oh, Mrs. Smith. Come on. Come on. That's not fair. [Person2]:  What do you mean it's not fair. Everyone else was there. So, why weren't you in class? [Person1]:  Uh, my bus didn't come this morning on time. That's why. [Person2]:  Um. Are you sure? Your friend, Tony, made it to class, and he said you were still in bed an hour ago. [Person1]:  Uhh, yeah, well, that might be true, but I really need to take the test. [Person2]:  Wait. Don't you realize that you just lied to me? [Person1]:  Uh, well, listen. Mrs. Smith. Listen. My alarm didn't go off this morning, so it's not my fault I came late. [Person2]:  So, you're blaming your alarm clock again? It's still your responsibility to be here. Wasn't that your excuse the last two times you missed class? [Person1]:  But Mrs. Smith, Mrs. Smith. [Person2]:  Listen. You know the policy of our program. If you miss a test for an unexcused reason ... and a lie is definitely unexcused, then you get a zero on the test. There are no exceptions. [Person1]:  Mrs. Smith. Why don't you want to help me? You never help me. I mean I really need to pass this class. [Person2]:  No, no. no. Listen to yourself. You're playing what we call the victim. You made some bad choices, and now you have to accept the consequences. Remember [Person1]:  But Mrs. Smith. I lose my scholarship if I do poorly in the class; my parents will be really disappointed in me. [Person2]:  I'm really sorry, but that's not my problem. [Oh, Mrs. Smith!] I can't help you with that. Don't try to shift the blame here. [Mrs. Smith!] You painted yourself into a corner. You need to be accountable for your own actions instead of trying to weasel out of your responsibility. While you aren't doing well in my class though, I must say I almost have to give you an A grade for trying to dodge the outcome of your bad choices. [Person1]:  Mrs. Smith, Mrs. Smith. [Person2]:  Listen. You are learning one thing. [Person1]:  What? [Person2]:  My name. [Person1]:  Agh.
[Person1]:  It is exciting just to think about it! It'll be my first trip to Hawaii. But I may have trouble finding my way around there when I'm there. [Person2]:  Don't worry about that. Just give me a call when you arrive. I'll be glad to show you around.
[Person1]:  Anyone home? Jen! [Person2]:  I'm in the kitchen. . . let yourself in! [Person1]:  Wow! You're really working up a storm! [Person2]:  I know. I've even worked up a sweat. [Person1]:  You look like a cooking show host--only messier.
[Person1]:  Do you have a family tradition at Christmas time? [Person2]:  We have so Ay! But my favorite happens at Christmas Eve. [Person1]:  What is it? [Person2]:  Well, all the brothers and sisters get together and fill the Christmas stockings for the litt 1e kids. [Person1]:  That's it? That's the tradition? [Person2]:  Well, in fact it's fun for us to just be together that night and do this one thing. [Person1]:  I guess the spirit of it is what really makes any tradition fun. [Person2]:  You should be there some Christmas Eve.
[Person1]:  I remember you said that you like China because it has cheap beers. [Person2]:  Yes, unbelievably cheap. Carlsborg is less than $ 1. [Person1]:  Why do you drink? I mean, where does drinking get you? [Person2]:  It's fashionable. [Person1]:  Come on, you don't even know that blinds following is a sign of immaturity. [Person2]:  Mary, it's not about the blind following. What matter is I enjoy in drinking. It's like when you get off of work. You're so tired. You need to get relaxed. You can't just turn on the TV and keep watch the programs until you fall asleep. You need to make your after work time more fun. [Person1]:  How? By drinking? [Person2]:  Drinking is just part of it. I mean, you have a bunch of friends coming by and having fun. You drink and talk. And the more you drink, the more you talk. It makes me so relaxed. [Person1]:  When did you begin to drink? [Person2]:  It's a long time ago. When I first went to a bar to pick up girls there, I saw the most beautiful girl sitting and sipping a coke. Then I went up to her and said'can I buy you a drink? ' [Person1]:  And then? [Person2]:  Then I talked to her and got her number. You know what? When you don't know what to say? Just drink. [Person1]:  So you get drunk every day?
[Person1]:  My old man always harps on me. [Person2]:  So does my father. I'm already used to it. [Person1]:  But I can't bear it, John. [Person2]:  How dare you say that? What they do is just for our good. [Person1]:  Yeah, but he really puts blame on me.
[Person1]:  Have you heard that we will have reorganization? [Person2]:  No, really? [Person1]:  Yes, flexible, aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department.

He passes the school on the way to the office.

[Person1]:  You are not looking very cheerful. What's the matter with you? [Person2]:  Oh, nothing special. I'm just thinking a lot. [Person1]:  About the job? [Person2]:  About everything. About catching the same train every morning, sitting in the same office all day and watching the same television program. [Person1]:  You need a holiday. [Person2]:  It wasn't always like this, you know. [Person1]:  What do you mean? [Person2]:  Well, our great great grandfathers had more fun, didn't they? I mean, they haunted for their food and grow their own vegetables and dip things for themselves. We do the same sort of job for years and years. There's no variety in our lives. [Person1]:  You need a holiday. That's what the matter is with you.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, Sir. But could you not smoke here? I'm pregnant. [Person2]:  Of course, I'm sorry, ma'am. I actually hate it too, but I can't quit. [Person1]:  I know it's not easy, but many of my friends have succeeded in quitting. [Person2]:  Really? How did they do it? [Person1]:  They quit for their family, they decided to give up smoking after they got married. [Person2]:  So, are you married? [Person1]:  No, I'm only 22 years old. [Person2]:  Then you must have started smoking at an early age. [Person1]:  Yes, I started 5 years ago, I was copying my father. Now I know that was a mistake. But it's too late. [Person2]:  It's not too late. You must believe that if you just try, you can do it. [Person1]:  Thanks. [Person2]:  So, does your father still smoke? [Person1]:  Not since he got throat cancer. I was really scared when I was told the news. [Person2]:  Smoking is really harmful. The earlier you stop smoking the better it is. [Person1]:  You are right. Anyway, I'll keep trying.
[Person1]:  Is it me or is it really hard to understand this speaker? [Person2]:  You're right, it's not that he has an accent like some of the other speakers from another country. It's just that he is speaking too softly. Do you think it would be rude to ask him to turn his microphone up a little bit? [Person1]:  I don't think he's wearing one, either that or he's turned it off. [Person2]:  That's crazy, there must be 400 people here. [Person1]:  This part of the conference has turned into such a waste of time. Maybe we should leave and try to find another lecture. [Person2]:  I can't do that. I come here specifically to hear this guys speech. I think I'll just go up to him at the end of the speech and try to ask him some questions. [Person1]:  Good idea, would you mind if I followed you up there? It might be the only way to get anything out of this hour? [Person2]:  No problem.
[Person1]:  Hi, can I help you? [Person2]:  Yes, I saw your ad in today's newspaper. It says that you need to hire an assistant. Can you tell me some information about the job? [Person1]:  OK. Well, we manage a very busy agency. The assistant will help by answering phones and typing documents. The problem is that you'll have to concentrate in a noisy environment. Can you handle that? [Person2]:  Yes, I have worked for busy organizations before. [Person1]:  And how fast can you type? [Person2]:  I type 60 words per minute. [Person1]:  Great. Feel free to come down and pick up an application from me. If we hire you, your position will be temporary for the first three months. [Person2]:  That makes sense. Well, I look forward to meeting you.

How much time are we going to have to work on this?

[Person1]:  So, basically, I am OK? [Person2]:  If there were any major problems, I would always notify you by phone to come in. [Person1]:  What will I learn when I see the results on the website? [Person2]:  A description of each test is given on the site. [Person1]:  What will the numbers tell me? [Person2]:  The website will give you a normal range and then tell you what your results are. [Person1]:  Are all of my test results on that site? [Person2]:  Your entire test history is on the site. You can compare your results from other years.
[Person1]:  I'd like to order dinner. [Person2]:  What would you like? [Person1]:  I'd like to order a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare. [Person2]:  I'm sorry. We're currently out of filet mignon. May I suggest the porterhouse instead? [Person1]:  I'd prefer the filet, but the porterhouse will do. [Person2]:  And may I suggest chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne? [Person1]:  Normally, I would take you up on that suggestion, but just the champagne will do for tonight. [Person2]:  Okay, no strawberries. Room service will be charged to your amenities account. Is that all right? [Person1]:  That's fine. [Person2]:  It will be up shortly. Enjoy your food, sir.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, could you tell me whether there is a restaurant near here? [Person2]:  Yes, there is one at Sanyuan Bridge. It is a famous restaurant in the city. [Person1]:  I'm afraid there must be a lot of people there. [Person2]:  I think so. I think you'd better make a phone call to see whether there is a table available. [Person1]:  But we don't know the telephone number. [Person2]:  Here is a tourist guidebook. You can look it up in the book. [Person1]:  You are so kind! Thank you very much. [Person2]:  It's a pleasure.
[Person1]:  Let's go to Wangfujing by bus. [Person2]:  Better take the subway. It's faster, and more convenient. [Person1]:  OK, it will be a new experience for me. [Person2]:  We have a rather comprehensive subway system here. You can get almost anywhere rather quickly on a subway, especially at this time of day when the traffic is heavy. [Person1]:  Where do we pay the fare? [Person2]:  Just give the man standing there 3 yuan and he'll give you a token. Then, you slip it into the slot at the turnstile and push the turnstile to get in. [Person1]:  Let me pay for it. Where can I get a subway map? [Person2]:  Ask the worker who sells tokens to give you one. It's free fo charge. Actually maps showing subway routes are posted at most stations. [Person1]:  Do I have to pay an additional fare to change trains? [Person2]:  No, you don't have to. Here comes the train.
[Person1]:  Look, Dad, many people are doing morning exercises here. [Person2]:  Yes. I used to come out here with my grandpa as child. [Person1]:  Really? You were so happy then. [Person2]:  Aren't you happy now? I hadn't seen the piano when I was a child. [Person1]:  Daddy, don't mention it. [Person2]:  The park is so beautiful. It is a good thing I have taken the camera. [Person1]:  Dad, I'd like to take a picture with the status. [Person2]:  All right. Give me a big smile. Are you ready? Cheese! [Person1]:  Daddy, we can't have a photo of the whole family. We can take one here. [Person2]:  Excuse me, sir. Could you take a photo for us? Just press this button.

[Person1]:  Hi, Nancy. How are you doing?  [Person2]:  Hi, Tom. Want a cup of coffee?  [Person1]:  Not right now. I've got to get another car and my old one is blown up.  [Person2]:  Oh, hey, did you look in the classified ads?  [Person1]:  You mean used car?  [Person2]:  No, Ah. . . single sellers.  [Person1]:  Well, yeah, but I'd be getting somebody else's problem.  [Person2]:  Uh huh. How about a used car? They've got good ones now.  [Person1]:  It's the same kind of deal though, you know, you never know what you're going to get.  [Person2]:  Oh, hey, how about a new car? They've got easy loans now. You'd feel so good driving a new car.  [Person1]:  Let's look at them all. Have you got a paper there? 
[Person1]:  Please, please, can you help me? I seem to have lost my handbag. [Person2]:  Calm down, Madam. Well, I'll have to fill out this report for you. What color is it, Madam? [Person1]:  Well, it is a white one. [Person2]:  How big is it? [Person1]:  Mm, I guess it's about one foot long and seven inches tall. [Person2]:  One foot long and seven inches tall. What's in the bag, Madam? [Person1]:  There is a wallet, two keys, and a letter. [Person2]:  And where did you leave it? [Person1]:  I am sure I left it in the coffee shop on the 5th floor. [Person2]:  Don't worry, Madam. I am sure we can find it. Now could you give me your name, your address and telephone number?
[Person1]:  I'm famished! Let's get some grub!  [Person2]:  I'm in the mood for some chips and salsa.  [Person1]:  Me, too! The chips here are so light and crispy.  [Person2]:  And they have tangy, freshly-made salsa, too. My mouth is watering already!  [Person1]:  I'll go get the chips. What do you want to drink?  [Person2]:  Surprise me. 
[Person1]:  Where are you going? [Person2]:  I'm going to the gym to lift weights. Want to come? [Person1]:  No, thanks. I'm going to prepare for my chemistry midterm. Do you usually just lift weights? [Person2]:  No. I lift to get stronger. Then I swim to help my heart and lungs and I jump rope to improve my balance. [Person1]:  Wow, I wish I had that much training. [Person2]:  Start slowly and a little more each day. [Person1]:  Thanks. Well, have fun.
[Person1]:  Who was that guy you were talking to at the bar? It looked like he was hitting on you.  [Person2]:  Yeah, we struck up a conversation, and eventually he asked me out. I gave him my number, but I'm not sure if I'll actually go out with him.  [Person1]:  Oh? How come?  [Person2]:  He's nice, but I just don't feel like we have much chemistry, so I don't want to lead him on. [Person1]:  Well, don't be too quick to judge. My last boyfriend and I didn't hit it off right away, I only started to fall for him after we went out a few times and I got to know him better. We were together for 3 years. [Person2]:  So why'd you split up? If you don't mind my asking.  [Person1]:  Not at all. We just started to drift apart, different interests, different plans for the future. The breakup was mutual. [Person2]:  Ah, that's great. My last relationship was a nightmare, I hooked up with a guy at a New Year's party and we were together for six months, but we were constantly fighting and making up. I don't know how I put up with him for so long. [Person1]:  How'd it end?  [Person2]:  He cheated on me, I caught him making out with his ex. He begged me for another chance, but I know he was just trying to jerk me around, so I said no. [Person1]:  Ugh! Good for you.  [Person2]:  Thanks. So how about you, are you going out with anyone at the moment? [Person1]:  Oh, I've gone on a few dates here and there, but nothing serious. To be honest, I'm not really interested in settling down just yet, I'm enjoying the single life too much.
[Person1]:  Taylor, can you tell me how to apply for a job on the Internet? [Person2]:  Just fill out an application. [Person1]:  Do I have to send an E-mail? [Person2]:  You are expected to know the E-mail address of the unit. [Person1]:  But I still don't know which unit is in need of staff. [Person2]:  Send out an application through Job-wanted on the website. [Person1]:  Can any unit see my information? [Person2]:  It's a two-way choice. And your application will be read.

[Person1]:  What's wrong, officer? [Person2]:  You do realize that you ran a red light, don't you? [Person1]:  I did? [Person2]:  You didn't see the red light? [Person1]:  I'm sorry for running it, but I really didn't know. [Person2]:  Didn't you learn that red means stop? [Person1]:  I know that. [Person2]:  Then tell me why you sped up on the yellow light. [Person1]:  I'm not sure. [Person2]:  I'm giving you a ticket for this. [Person1]:  I'm sorry for the misunderstanding. [Person2]:  Maybe you'll think about this before you decide to run another light.
[Person1]:  What kind of music do you like listening to? [Person2]:  I like music that has a fast beat and is lively, like dance music. You know, I go to a disco almost every week. Sometimes it's too loud though. You prefer classical music, don't you? [Person1]:  Yes, I do. I find it very relaxing. I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work. [Person2]:  I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music. It's certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music. [Person1]:  Classical music is supposed to be good for you brain. Research suggest that it makes your brain more active. Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better. [Person2]:  Really? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often. I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress. [Person1]:  Yes. That's why I listen to it in the evenings. I usually play it as background music while I'm cooking or doing other housework. [Person2]:  I'Ve got a few classical music CD's. I should follow your lead and increase my brian power. [Person1]:  You can find plenty of recording on the internet too. You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them. [Person2]:  That's a good idea. You should do the same with some music. You might find something you like. Classical music might make you clever, but dance might make you livelier and happier. [Person1]:  That's true. There's clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people. Music can influence a person's feeling and character.
[Person1]:  Um, which of them is the better typist?  [Person2]:  Well, Mary types faster than Jones. But I think Jones types more carefully.  [Person1]:  Is there any difference in their short hand?  [Person2]:  Jones can certainly take down letter more quickly, but Mary's short hand is the best in her class.  [Person1]:  How about languages?  [Person2]:  Both of them speak excellent French. But I think Mary speaks German more fluently than Jones does.  [Person1]:  Um. That doesn't really matter. Because we have more French visitors than German. 
[Person1]:  Hi Jane, can you let me know the best way to get to your house this evening? [Person2]:  Certainly, where will you be coming from? [Person1]:  I need to be in the city centre this afternoon so I will be coming straight from there. [Person2]:  Ok. Take the Underground, the Circle line, to High Street Kensington. Make sure you take the High Street Kensington exit. [Person1]:  Got that. [Person2]:  Ok - when you leave the Underground, cross the road and you should see Horntown Street. Was up that street to the crossroads. As you was you should see a fast food place on your right. [Person1]:  Hold on, I am looking at the map now. Ok, I can see Horntown Road. Do I go straight at the intersection? [Person2]:  No, you need to turn left into Philimore Was and take the next right. [Person1]:  Ok, I can see that road. [Person2]:  That's fine. You will not miss it because it's just next to the Kensington centra Library. [Person1]:  Good, I can see the library on the map. [Person2]:  Ok, we live in the third building on your left. Will we see you around 7 pm? [Person1]:  That's great, see you at seven.
[Person1]:  The Mountains would be a great place for the company retreat. [Person2]:  That's a wonderful choice. [Person1]:  I have chosen January as the month for this retreat. [Person2]:  January is a little too close to the Christmas holidays. [Person1]:  Yes, maybe another choice might be better. [Person2]:  I think that April would work. Spring is a lovely time to be in the mountains. [Person1]:  Thank you for thinking of that. [Person2]:  Maybe if we asked around we could see what people would prefer. [Person1]:  That is a good idea. [Person2]:  I'll take care of taking the survey and get back to you with the answers.
[Person1]:  Want to send out for some Chinese? [Person2]:  Some what? [Person1]:  Some Chinese food. I'm hungry, and there's a take-out restaurant near here. We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat. [Person2]:  No, I'd rather go out. The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home. Maybe we can try some other food today. . . What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day, the one over in the shopping center? [Person1]:  Okay. I could go for that. It's called Al's Steakhouse. They also have great fried fish, and I love their salad bar. You can go back to refill 1 your plate as often as you like. [Person2]:  Is that the place that serves such large portions of meat? [Person1]:  Yes, their steaks are enormous. Sometimes I can't finish what I'Ve ordered. [Person2]:  What if that happens to me? I hate to let food go to waste. [Person1]:  Don't worry. We'll just get a doggie bag.
[Person1]:  I want to make dinner tonight. [Person2]:  What are you thinking of making? [Person1]:  I don't have any idea what to cook. [Person2]:  How about making a teriyaki bowl? [Person1]:  Can you tell me how to make it? [Person2]:  All it consists of is teriyaki beef and white rice. [Person1]:  Okay, but what do I have to do to prepare it? [Person2]:  All you have to do is cook some white rice. [Person1]:  What do I do after that? [Person2]:  Then cut up the beef and marinate it in teriyaki sauce. [Person1]:  What else do I have to do? [Person2]:  All that's left is to cook it.
[Person1]:  So that will be one teddy, two terry cloth robes, three pairs of satin slippers, and two pairs of pajamas. [Person2]:  Does all that come to 10, 000 NT? [Person1]:  Let me see. . . yes, more. That will be 15, 880 NT in total. And after the discount, your total comes to 12, 704 NT. Here's your free teddy bear, free panties and your card application. [Person2]:  Where do I sign? [Person1]:  Right here. And write your address. You'll get the card in the mail within a week. [Person2]:  OK. [Person1]:  I know your friend will like the gift set, especially the teddy bear. [Person2]:  Well, the teddy bear is for me! [Person1]:  Remember to keep your receipt in case your friend needs to make any exchanges. There are no refunds on sale items.
[Person1]:  Madam, I made a close study of the draft contract yesterday evening. I think there are something needs to modify. [Person2]:  Which terms? [Person1]:  First, about the terms of payment. Your draft contract says that payment is to be made by D \ A. This is not our practice. We prefer to have the payment made by L \ C through a negotiating bank in America. [Person2]:  Good. I will add this to the contract. [Person1]:  The second thing I would like to point out, that is packaging. It's stipulated in the contract that all the computer parts should be packed in cardboard boxes. But I think the wooden cases are much safer. [Person2]:  Well, you are right. Is there anything else? [Person1]:  As far as the contract stipulations are concerned, there is nothing more. Thank you very much. [Person2]:  Well, we have agreed on all the major points.
[Person1]:  Excuse me. I've been waiting for over an hour. My appointment was scheduled for 11 [Person2]:  What's your name, sir? [Person1]:  Peter Jennings. [Person2]:  Let's see...you're next, Mr. Jennings. Dr. Watson is just finishing up with another patient. It should only be another couple of minutes. [Person1]:  It took me two months to get this appointment. I'm just worried that I'll be late getting back to the office. If I'm late for my meeting, my boss will be upset. [Person2]:  But you have a medical appointment. I'm sure he'll understand... [Person1]:  It's a 'she', actually. The problem is that I'll give a presentation at the meeting. If I'm late, the whole thing will be... [Person2]:  Oh, look who's here! [Person1]:  Thank goodness! Dr. Watson...
[Person1]:  Do you think you can take me to the Grand Hotel in 30 minutes? [Person2]:  It depends. If the traffic isn't too heavy... Anyhow, I'll try my best. You've got enough time. [Person1]:  How much should I pay? [Person2]:  $12.75, please. [Person1]:  Thanks a lot. Here's $15. Give me $1.00 back, please.
[Person1]:  The manager just emailed to say that the meeting would be put off till the next Sunday. Will you have everything ready by then? Anna, what's wrong? Are you hearing me? [Person2]:  Sorry, I was thinking about my brother. I haven't heard from him for two weeks. [Person1]:  How often do you call each other? [Person2]:  Usually at least once a week, but he's now a volunteer teacher at a mountain village. I can only write to him. [Person1]:  The mail can be really slow sometimes. I'm sure you'll hear from him soon. [Person2]:  I hope so.
[Person1]:  Hello, Bob. I haven't seen you for a long time. How are you getting along with your preparations for the entrance exam? [Person2]:  Well, I really can't tell. Anyhow, I'm doing my best, working night and day. [Person1]:  So am I. Sometimes, I feel very tired, both physically and mentally. [Person2]:  I feel the same. I often suffer from headaches and general weakness. Not enough time for sleeping. I don't know what will become of me if it goes on like this for long. [Person1]:  And no time for sports, even music, not to mention films or TV programs. All we can see is exercises, exam papers and this sort of things. [Person2]:  It seems that to go to college is the only future we have. [Person1]:  Certainly not. Even if we can't go to college, we can take up many other jobs and do our bits for the society as well. [Person2]:  Quite right. But we'll get more knowledge after studying several years at college. That means we can work better for our country and people after graduation. In addition our parents lay great hope on us, and we shouldn't make them feel disappointed.
[Person1]:  Good evening, can I get you a drink?  [Person2]:  Sure, I would like a Coke.  [Person1]:  Would you like to order anything off the appetizer menu?  [Person2]:  Let's see, can I get some fried zucchini, please?  [Person1]:  Would you like to order anything else?  [Person2]:  No, that's it, thank you.  [Person1]:  No problem, call me when you're ready to place the rest of your order.  [Person2]:  I would like to order my food now.  [Person1]:  What did you want to order?  [Person2]:  Can I get a cheeseburger and some fries?  [Person1]:  Can I get you anything else?  [Person2]:  That's all, thank you. 
[Person1]:  People are funny.  [Person2]:  They sure are.  [Person1]:  Did you hear about the pilot?  [Person2]:  The one that stole a small plane?  [Person1]:  Yes, he stole a plane in Canada and flew into the U. S.  [Person2]:  Did they catch him?  [Person1]:  Yes. After two U. S. fighter jets followed him for an hour, he landed on a highway.  [Person2]:  Did he crash?  [Person1]:  No, he just landed the plane and walked to a restaurant.  [Person2]:  Did the cops find out why he flew into the U. S. ?  [Person1]:  His life sucked. He was hoping a fighter jet would shoot him down.  [Person2]:  Poor guy. 
[Person1]:  Hi. I ' m here to catch flight 513 to New York. [Person2]:  May I see your ticket please? [Person1]:  Here you are. Do you need to see my passport? [Person2]:  Any form of picture I. D. will do. [Person1]:  Mmmm... a photo I. D. I have my New Jersey driver ' s license. Is that ok? [Person2]:  That will do. What an interesting picture! How old is it? [Person1]:  Actually it wad taken just last year, but I had a shaved head and a beard. Can you still recognize me? [Person2]:  Barely. Will you be checking any luggage today? [Person1]:  Yes, One suitcase. I also have a carry-on bag. [Person2]:  Ok. Mr. Lee, you ' re all set. Your flight leaves from gate 10. Boarding begins at 10
[Person1]:  What's the matter, John? you seemed to be restless today. [Person2]:  You see, I've been offered a new job. I can't decide whether to take it or not. [Person1]:  Oh, that's easy. If it's better than the one you are doing now, go for it. That's my advice. [Person2]:  It isn't that easy. I hate to quit my present job. People around here are very nice and the work itself is challenging. [Person1]:  Then what about the salary? Would you get more? [Person2]:  Yes, they say I would get a big sum. [Person1]:  Have you discussed it with your wife? [Person2]:  Yes, she leaves it to me. [Person1]:  As I say it the work is well worth try. After all you can get a higher salary. [Person2]:  I have to think about it.
[Person1]:  Where did you get all these barney tour pamphlets? [Person2]:  I took them from a travel agency. Look at those nice pictures, lash forest, palm fringed, white sand beaches, crystal blue ocean, they're breath-taking. It is like paradise on earth. [Person1]:  That's why it's become a very popular holiday destination these years. Someone told me the service there is very good too. Are you planning to spend the holiday there? [Person2]:  Yes, I'm thinking about signing up for a tour in the travel agency. Their next tour starts the same time as my holiday does next month. [Person1]:  How many days is the tour? [Person2]:  10 days. When I get back, I still have two days to go before work. Isn't that great? [Person1]:  That's a perfect plan. Enjoy yourself.
[Person1]:  Hello, Alice. Would you like to go to the temple fair with me? [Person2]:  Temple fair? [Person1]:  Yes. The ancient custom of holding temple fairs is to offer sacrifices to the god of the earth, and they have developed into a festival filled with food, performances and games now. [Person2]:  Sounds interesting! [Person1]:  Absolutely, I love temple fairs. Beijing has several temple fairs recently. They are different from each other to some extent, but also have a lot in common. [Person2]:  I just can't wait to see them. Which one do you choose today? [Person1]:  What about Tianqiao Temple Fair? A variety of opera performances, acrobatics shows, and food will dazzle you. [Person2]:  Great! Do you know how to get there? [Person1]:  Of course. [Person2]:  Couldn't be better.
[Person1]:  Tomorrow I'll take you to some places that I'm sure you will have interest in. [Person2]:  Where else haven't we been to yet? [Person1]:  They are the Folk Antique Handicrafts and Collectibles Exhibition Halls. [Person2]:  Sounds great! How many kinds of folk collections do they have? [Person1]:  Well. there're actually over 200 kinds of folk collections in this city. That's half the collections of antique objects in China. There's one exhibition half for multiple collection, and several individual display rooms for private collectors. [Person2]:  Private collectors! They must have excellent collections. I'II go and see each of them. What kinds of collections can I see? Come on, don't keep me in suspense! [Person1]:  No hurry! I'II tell you now, The collections include ancient cases and caskets, tea sets, abacuses, precious sea shells and conches, drama costumes, agates, ancient coins, fans, mini-musical instruments, root-carving, rare stones and rocks, model ships, model cars. . . [Person2]:  Enough! I can't wait anymore.
[Person1]:  How are you doing? [Person2]:  Everything's fine with me. [Person1]:  What can I do for you today? [Person2]:  Is it possible for me to view the apartment today? [Person1]:  Unfortunately, you will not be able to view it today. [Person2]:  Why can't I view it today? [Person1]:  You'll need to make an appointment to view the apartment. [Person2]:  I understand. May I make an appointment then? [Person1]:  How does this Friday sound? [Person2]:  Friday at 6 pm. would be perfect. [Person1]:  That will be fine. [Person2]:  Thanks for your help.
[Person1]:  Judy, what do you think of the new general manager? [Person2]:  He has extensive experience, although the guy's really deep, sometimes, it scares me. [Person1]:  I heard he's very clear about his likes and dislikes and he's not the type to just let things go, so don't provoke him. [Person2]:  I know, and that's why I'm always respectful and I keep my distance. It's safer that way. [Person1]:  Me too, I don't know why, but every time I see the guy, I break into a cold sweat. [Person2]:  It's in the eyes. They're the type that seems to look into your soul, making one really uneasy. [Person1]:  Whatever we said, we must be more careful. [Person2]:  Yes, I agree with you.
[Person1]:  Look! Allen has the mike! [Person2]:  I thought he only liked to listen? [Person1]:  That was before he heard Stanley sing! I guess he couldn't stand it anymore, so he decided to give it a try himself! Allen has a really good voice! He sounds like Enrique Iglesias! [Person2]:  And he can move, too! He dances like Ricky Martin!
[Person1]:  How many hours do you work a week? [Person2]:  I do a forty-hour week. I'm on flexi-time. I usually start work at 8 a. m. and finish at 4 [Person1]:  And how many weeks holiday do you get a year? [Person2]:  Four - plus public holidays. I usually take two weeks off in the summer and the rest at New Year. [Person1]:  Do you do overtime? [Person2]:  Yes, if we're busy. I'm paid double-time if I work at weekends.
[Person1]:  I'm not satisfied with it. [Person2]:  Why not? What's wrong with it? [Person1]:  Sometimes it goes fast. And sometimes it goes slow. And the alarm doesn'twork, either. [Person2]:  Would you like another one? [Person1]:  No. Can I have my money back? [Person2]:  Hmm. . . have you got a receipt? [Person1]:  A receipt? [Person2]:  Yes. I must see your receipt. You can't have your money back without receipt. [Person1]:  Oh, I'm not certain, but I think I've lost it.
[Person1]:  Good morning. Miss Zhao. Please sit down. [Person2]:  Thank you. It's nice to meet you. Mr. Zhang. [Person1]:  I have your application here. You are a university student? [Person2]:  Yes. I'm a business major. [Person1]:  So you are interested in working for our company. [Person2]:  Yes, I need a part time job, both for money and experience. [Person1]:  We'll have an opening for an office clerk this summer. [Person2]:  That would be wonderful. [Person1]:  Are you computer trained? [Person2]:  Yes, I can handle Windows, Power Point, and Excel. Here is my certificate. [Person1]:  Ah. that's very good. You'll need some training in our methods, though. Every office is different, you know. [Person2]:  Thank you. That will be very helpful for my future. When do I start exactly? [Person1]:  We'll let you know as soon as possible. Goodbye. [Person2]:  Goodbye.
[Person1]:  We are having a debate on advertising Thursday evening, and I have to take part. [Person2]:  That's interesting. I should like to hear what people think about advertising. [Person1]:  What's there to say? We must have advertising, mustn't we? [Person2]:  Why? [Person1]:  Well, we wouldn't know what there was to buy if we didn't have advertisements. [Person2]:  Yes, that's true. Up to a point, advertisements provide information that we need. IF someone has produced a new article, naturally, the seller wants to tell us about it. [Person1]:  Yes, and the advertisements tell us which product is the best. [Person2]:  Do they? I don't think so. Every manufacture says that his product is the best, or at least tries to give the impression. Only one can be the best, so the others are misleading, aren't they? [Person1]:  Well, in a way, I suppose, but we don't have to believe them, do we? [Person2]:  Are you saying that advertisements aren't effective? I don't think that intelligent businessmen will spend millions of dollars on advertising if nobody believes the advertisements, do you? [Person1]:  Perhaps not, but after all, it's their money that they are spending. [Person2]:  Is it? I think not. The cost of advertising is added to the price of the article. You and I and all the other people who buy the article pay for the advertising. [Person1]:  Well, I suppose we get something for our money, some information. [Person2]:  Yes, but don't forget it is often misleading information, and sometimes harmful. [Person1]:  Harmful? [Person2]:  What about the advertisements desiring to persuade young people to smoke cigarettes? Wouldn't you say the are harmful? [Person1]:  You've given me a lot to think about. I'm quite looking forward to the debate now.
[Person1]:  The prevailing attitude about premarital contracting is that it spoils the whole concept of marriage, love, and trust. How do you counter that? [Person2]:  First of all, most of us hear about premarital contracting when someone rich and famous gets divorced and about all the battles they are going through. I know when my husband and I decided that we wanted to have a premarital contract, my son said 'Why you guys doing that? Don't you trust each other?' So it's not surprising that people's initial reaction is a negative one. But in fact, premarital contracting is a way that we can learn more about each other, make each other feel more comfortable about issues that are of concerns, and certainly clarify money concerns. This way, we can talk about them, decide together how we want our marriage to work, and if necessary, and only if necessary, we put it in a premarital contract, a legal document. [Person1]:  Each year, there is one divorce for every two marriages. And a substantial portion of those who have divorced remarry. Is the notion of the premarital contract simply for those who are entering second marriages, or is it also something for the people getting married for the first time? [Person3]:  Premarital contracting is a communication process. I think all of us, whatever age we are, whatever financial status we have, we have things to talk about. And if we avoid doing that and wait until there are problems, it's almost too late. I think that no matter what age, whether we've been married once or not, whether we have stepchildren, whether we have assets, it's important to communicate and consider a legal document.
[Person1]:  Excuse me. Can you tell me which is the way to the nearest shoe shop? [Person2]:  There's one on Queen's Road. [Person1]:  Thank you, but how can I get there? [Person2]:  It's not far from here. Walk along this road and after three blocks you'll see a post office on your right. The shop is just behind it. [Person1]:  How long do you think it will take me to get there? [Person2]:  About 20 minutes at the most. Anyway, you can take the No.102 Bus. [Person1]:  I'd better go there by bus. By the way, where is the bus stop, please? [Person2]:  Just across the road. [Person1]:  Thanks a lot.
[Person1]:  Dave, there's something I want to talk to you about. [Person2]:  Zina, why are you whispering? [Person1]:  I've been talking to WebTracker. I'm thinking of jumping ship. [Person2]:  What? Are you serious? You'd defect to our archrival! ? [Person1]:  Keep your voice down. We'll talk more later. Right now I need to see Vince. [Person2]:  We definitely have to talk, Zina. And watch your back. Elvin is still mad about his nose. [Person1]:  OK, but don't tell anyone what I said.
[Person1]:  (Sniffing) Phew! Is that French coffee? [Person2]:  Pardon? [Person1]:  Is that French coffee you are drinking? [Person2]:  Yes,that's right. Why? What's the matter? [Person1]:  I don't understand why you drink French coffee. It makes a strong smell. [Person2]:  I like it very much, I prefer it to English coffee. [Person1]:  Have you got a lot of it? [Person2]:  Yes. Why? [Person1]:  Well.., er...could I get some from you? [Person2]:  Get some from me? But...you don't like French coffee! [Person1]:  No, I don't, but my wife does and I can't understand why.
[Person1]:  Hello, this is Andrea. [Person2]:  Hello, Andrea, this is Alex. I have some very good news for you. Miranda was very satisfied with you, and said she's very much looking forward to working with you. Isn't that wonderful? Congratulations, dear. How does it feel to be Miranda's new assistant? I imagine that you're just delighted with this news. So let's see, you can start on Monday, right? [Person1]:  Emm, well, I don't think I can start Monday. I am visiting my father in Baltimore. And because I don't live in New York, I'll need a couple of days to find a flat and buy some furniture, and move my things from my current apartment. [Person2]:  Oh, well, then, in that case, I suppose Wednesday would be good. OK, see you then.
[Person1]:  Lily, where do you like to eat? [Person2]:  Well, my favorite restaurant is the Knife and Talk. It's very near the city center. At lunch, it's full of office workers, but I like to go before that, in the middle of the morning. I go there and order big breakfast and take one of their newspapers and just relax for an hour or so. Their pancakes are delicious. They don't have a TV in there, which I love most. They just have some jazz music, very quiet. Nothing too loud. What's your favorite restaurant? [Person1]:  Well, it's just a very simple restaurant. There are only about 6 tables in there, a couple of waitresses wear ugly pink uniforms. But the food is great, very tasty and cheap too, which is important of course. There are some truck drivers sitting at the counter drinking coffee. And eating sausages every morning. I always have pancakes in the morning, and their fish pie for lunch. That restaurant has been open for many years. They say the actor James Dean eats there, sometimes, but I don't think that's true.
[Person1]:  Shirly, I'm working on our class diary for next week. Would you please give me the information? [Person2]:  Sure. First is the deadline for after class activity application. The deadline is next Monday, June fourteenth. [Person1]:  Monday, June fourteenth. [Person2]:  Yes, then on Wednesday, that's the sixteenth, all classmates have to hand in three student photos. [Person1]:  Three student photos. [Person2]:  OK. Next is the basketball club meeting. It's on the seventeenth. [Person1]:  The basketball club meeting on the seventeenth, and where will they meet? [Person2]:  At the stadium. [Person1]:  And at what time? [Person2]:  From 12 [Person1]:  Right. [Person2]:  Then the last thing is about filling in a form with up-to-date personal data. Our class needs to go to the computer room during the morning break on the eighteenth. [Person1]:  OK. The morning break on the eighteenth. [Person2]:  Ah, wait a minute. I made a mistake. It should be during the lunch break. [Person1]:  Got it. [Person2]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  Take a seat inside and see what you think. So you will take the Porsche then, sir? [Person2]:  Yes, and I want to buy the insurance too. I think it's necessary. [Person1]:  You're smart to buy it. At 45 dollars for three days, it is a good deal. [Person2]:  Can I return the car in San Francisco? [Person1]:  San Francisco? No, sir. We only have this office here. You will have to return it here. [Person2]:  Really? I heard in America you can return rental cars in different cities. [Person1]:  No, sir. That's only with the very big companies. I'm sorry, but this car must be returned to this lot. [Person2]:  Well, I guess I will have to drive back down then. Hmm. I didn't think of that. [Person1]:  Do you still want the car, sir? [Person2]:  Yes. It will be fun. Driving back down the coast. My girlfriend will like it. [Person1]:  It's a beautiful drive. [Person2]:  Where are the keys? [Person1]:  Just a moment, sir. We have to finish filling out the forms.
[Person1]:  What are you reading? [Person2]:  It is a book written by a guy who was born without arms or legs. [Person1]:  What? So how does he get around? [Person2]:  He can actually walk pretty well, but he can't move that fast. He also has an assistant who helps him. He is actually quite successful. [Person1]:  He must have worked pretty hard. [Person2]:  Yeah, he travels around the world and gives a speech is to young people. He's changed many people's lives. Even when nothing seemed possible he stayed positive and put in even more effort.
[Person1]:  Doctor, I feel much better now. Will I be albe to go home some time this week? [Person2]:  That's good to hear. You've had an ideal recovery from your operation. We're going to send you home tomorrow. [Person1]:  Do you think I can get back to work very soon? [Person2]:  Don't be in such a hurry. I'm confident that you'll be completely recovered in 4 to 6 weeks. [Person1]:  Is there anything I should do? [Person2]:  You'd better have a good rest for a week. Be sure to have regular meals. Stay away from alcohol.Give up smoking at least a little while. [Person1]:  Should I take some medicine? [Person2]:  Yes. I'm going to give you some.Take one tablet of this medicine three times a day before meals. For that one, two tablets. And remember to come to the out patient department for a consultation in two weeks, please. [Person1]:  It's very kind of you. [Person2]:  You're welcome. We wish you a speedy recovery.Goodbye.
[Person1]:  Have you declared your income and are you prepared to pay tax? [Person2]:  Not yet. I don't know how to fill out the form. What is the tax-free allowance for supporting a dependent? [Person1]:  I don't really know. Why not ask the accountant or the lawyer of the law firm? They will tell you which is subject or not subject to taxation. He can even help you avoid paying tax legally. [Person2]:  If I don't pay my taxes, would the tax officials discover it? [Person1]:  Certainly. No one who evades tax can escape from their detection. They ' ll check your income through computers. You'd better make a declaration to the tax authorities as soon as possible. If you fail to meet the deadline, you will be fined.
[Person1]:  How may I help you? [Person2]:  I couldn't find the book I was looking for. [Person1]:  Have you checked the database? [Person2]:  I checked. [Person1]:  Was it on the shelf? [Person2]:  It should have been, but it wasn't. [Person1]:  Maybe someone took it. [Person2]:  Will you be getting another copy anytime soon? [Person1]:  I'm sure we will. [Person2]:  Would you be able to reserve it for me? [Person1]:  I sure will. [Person2]:  Thank you very much.
[Person1]:  I do feel like a trip to Florida on such a gloomy day in New York, to enjoy the sunshine while lying on the beaches of Florida. [Person2]:  That's a great idea. It's the best season for tourists in Florida. You can also get a good sun-tan there. [Person1]:  But if the sunshine is too strong, it might damage the eyes and the skin. [Person2]:  You can put on your shades. And remember don't make your skin look like a tomato. Or else after that your skin will begin to flake off. You may even wind up with skin cancer. [Person1]:  I see. Overdoing it will do more harm than good. [Person2]:  You said it.
[Person1]:  Well, how did you enjoy your seaside trip? [Person2]:  It was funny. [Person1]:  Tell me about it, will you? [Person2]:  Well, we drove through the valley on our way there in the morning. It was a magnificent sight. [Person1]:  Did you stop at the big waterfall for pictures? [Person2]:  Sure, we wouldn't miss it for anything. After that, we took a short cut to the park. There was very little traffic, so we got there in less than an hour. [Person1]:  You were lucky then. What did you do after that? [Person2]:  We went for a swim in the sea. That was the best part of the day. Just look at my nice tan. [Person1]:  So you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday. [Person2]:  Yes, you're right. And I was so tired that I fell asleep on the way back. My arms are still stiff from the swim yesterday.
[Person1]:  Caroline Menzies speaking. [Person2]:  Could I speak to Diana Curzon? [Person1]:  I'm afraid she's in a meeting at the moment. Who's speaking? [Person2]:  This is John Laing from Dantons. [Person1]:  Can I take a message, Mr. Laing? [Person2]:  Yes, please. I'm actually returning her call. So perhaps you could tell her that I called. [Person1]:  Certainly. Does she have your number? [Person2]:  She must have, but let me give it to you anyway. It's 01705 455623. [Person1]:  01705. . . [Person2]:  455623. [Person1]:  455623. [Person2]:  That's right. [Person1]:  OK. I'll make sure she gets the message. [Person2]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  May I speak to Marry? [Person2]:  Marry is not in right now, she went shopping with her mum. [Person1]:  Will it be too late if I call around ten this evening? [Person2]:  That's all right. We don't go to bed early.
[Person1]:  Have you seen the movie Catwoman? [Person2]:  No, not yet. Is it good? [Person1]:  Yes, it's quite amusing, actually. Good plot, and Sharon Stone's in it. [Person2]:  Oh, she's good. She is my favorite! She must be getting on a bit now. [Person1]:  Yeah, but she looks amazing. [Person2]:  So what's the movie about? [Person1]:  Well, it's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for. But then she got reincarnated as a cat. [Person2]:  Huh? [Person1]:  I know. Stay with me. She then decided to get her revenge by revealing the company secret and killing the boss. First, though, she had to discover her true cat nature. At the end she had a big fight with Sharon Stone, who was the real danger in the company. She had actually murdered the boss, who was her husband, and then tried to frame Catwoman for the murder, so everyone thought Catwoman was evil. [Person2]:  I see. Catwoman married the boss? [Person1]:  No. Sharon Stone was married to the boss, who treated her badly, so she killed him. So where was I? OK, so then, at the same time she fell in love with a cop, who was investigating the murder of the boss. Finally, she ditched the cop to follow her feline nature. [Person2]:  Wait a minute, I'm lost. The cop killed the boss? [Person1]:  No, Sharon Stone did. [Person2]:  And Sharon Stone is Catwoman? [Person1]:  Haven't you been listening to a word I've been saying?
[Person1]:  Did you go out yesterday evening? [Person2]:  Yes, we went to the Tianjin sports center to watch a women volleyball game between Tianjin and US. The US team was led by Lang Ping, the former coach of the Chinese national team. [Person1]:  How was the game? [Person2]:  It's very exciting, we enjoyed it very much, but we missed the first 30 minutes. [Person1]:  Why? [Person2]:  We took a wrong bus, so we were late for the game. We got there at 7 [Person1]:  That's too bad.
[Person1]:  Oh, wow. I can't believe today is our last day of school. No more teaching for three months straight! So where are you going for summer vacation? [Person2]:  A couple of months ago, one of my students gave me a magazine. I was greatly interested in it. Now I get it in my mailbox every month. [Person1]:  Why don't you just read it online? [Person2]:  Well, I just love the photos, and sometimes I cut them out and put them up on my wall. [Person1]:  Huh? [Person2]:  I have been planning my vacation ever since I got that first magazine. I pick the most interesting photos, cut them out, and put them up on my wall. I look at them and decide where I want to go most. [Person1]:  Most people just do that on Facebook, you know... [Person2]:  Well, I just prefer to do it this way. [Person1]:  So how many photos do you have on your wall? [Person2]:  About a dozen. [Person1]:  So have you decided where you will go? [Person2]:  Oh, yes. I even have my plane ticket. [Person1]:  I can't wait to hear where it is. Two months of planning and studying photos...okay, so...where are you going? [Person2]:  To Morocco! I'll be there for a month! [Person1]:  That sounds great!
[Person1]:  I think Andy's party will be fun.  [Person2]:  Yeah, I think so. Oh, by the way, I need to ask you something.  [Person1]:  What's that?  [Person2]:  Could I get back the sweater you borrowed?  [Person1]:  Sure. Oh, that reminds me. Could I borrow your black leather boots?  [Person2]:  My boots? Er. . . Sure, ok. 
[Person1]:  I have been having a lot of headaches lately.  [Person2]:  Have you been having these headaches for a long time?

[Person1]:  I've been under stress, but no more than usual.  [Person2]:  Have you been getting enough sleep lately?  [Person1]:  No, I only sleep a few hours a night.  [Person2]:  Have you had any head injuries lately?  [Person1]:  Yes, actually I fell skiing last week and hit my head.  [Person2]:  I am going to send you for a CT scan, and I will see you again when we see the results. 
[Person1]:  Mom, I want a puppy. [Person2]:  Let me think about it. [Person1]:  Why do you have to think about it? [Person2]:  Because puppies cost money. [Person1]:  No, they don't. Puppies are free. [Person2]:  Yes, but puppies need their shots. [Person1]:  Shots for what? [Person2]:  So they won't get sick, just like why you get your shots. [Person1]:  I hate shots. [Person2]:  And puppies have to eat. Food costs money. [Person1]:  No problem. I'll give him some food off my plate. [Person2]:  Oh, no, you won't. Puppies don't eat vegetables.

[Person1]:  I saw an interesting program on TV last night. It was about elderly people. [Person2]:  And what did the program say? [Person1]:  It said that people with a positive attitude tend to live longer and happier. [Person2]:  I think that many physicians now agree with that idea. [Person1]:  And the TV program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress. [Person2]:  And the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise. My father is over 60 years old, and he lifts weights every day.
[Person1]:  Hello there! Come on in! Don't just stand there! Come and take a seat! [Person2]:  Um, okay. Well, I just want a trim. Nothing too fancy. [Person1]:  Oh my gosh! Your hair is amazing!

[Person1]:  There is a huge slide on the playground and lots of trees and even a little brook! [Person2]:  What about inside the school? [Person1]:  There is a library right inside the front door. [Person2]:  I think our child is going to love it!
[Person1]:  Tomorrow is Halloween, I know I'm ready. I bought two pumpkins and a big bags of candy. Do you want to help me a jack-o-lantern? [Person2]:  I'd love to. I heard about Halloween when I was in Beijing. It's kind of a children's day. Small kids get dressed up, then walk around with paper bags or baskets, knocking on the neighbor's [Person1]:  They are supposed to say trick or treat? Then the neighbors are supposed to hand up the candy. [Person2]:  That's kind of cool. But what's the trick mean? [Person1]:  Usually it's the older kids going around playing Halloween, like punching the pumpkins left outside people's doors or - - someone's tree. They usually do it late at night after little kids go [Person2]:  That sounds kind of fun, maybe I can get tighter with my friends that night. [Person1]:  Usually be adults, you don't have kids have a big party in get dressed up too. [Person2]:  That does sound a lot of fun.

[Person1]:  Daniel, have you ever heard about the wildlife sanctuary? [Person2]:  Is that different from this kind of zoo? [Person1]:  Yes, of course. [Person2]:  So tell me about it! [Person1]:  There are a lot of wild animals in that place, and also some special rules while visiting. [Person2]:  Special rules? [Person1]:  There, you only have two ways for visiting. [Person2]:  Details? [Person1]:  On their bus or in your own cars, and you won't be allowed to get off the bus until you reach the special region. [Person2]:  Why not? [Person1]:  Because it is dangerous to get out of the car or bus. You can just imagine how fierce the wild animals can be. [Person2]:  That makes sense. But that sounds interesting. Is there one in Beijing too? [Person1]:  Yes. [Person2]:  I prefer to go there next time. [Person1]:  Yeah, sure, you won't be disappointed.
[Person1]:  you haven't spent much time with Sophia lately. Are you speaking to each other at the moment? [Person2]:  no, we're not. We've been drifting apart for a while. [Person1]:  but you two used to do everything together. I thought you really enjoyed each other's company. [Person2]:  we did, but since she started her new job, all she does is hang out with her new friends from work. [Person1]:  can't you hang out with them, too? [Person2]:  I could, but all they ever talk about is work, so I always end up feeling left out. [Person1]:  maybe you should invite her over for dinner, so it's just the two of you. [Person2]:  I tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her! She's so busy these days that it's just impossible to hang out with her. [Person1]:  it can't be that bad. She was always a really good friend to you. [Person2]:  you're right. She would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge. But she just doesn't seem very interested in our friendship anymore. [Person1]:  she's probably just excited about her new job. You should give her some time. It would be a shame to lose such a good friend. [Person2]:  I've given her enough time. I'm over it now. [Person1]:  I still think you two should try to patch things up. [Person2]:  I think I just have to accept the fact that it's time for us to go our separate ways.
[Person1]:  Tell me something about your Valentine's Day. [Person2]:  Ok, on that day, boys usually give roses to the sweet hearts and girls give them chocolate in return. [Person1]:  So romantic. young people must have lot of fun. [Person2]:  Yeah, that is what the holiday is for, isn't it?
[Person1]:  Julia, Julia, Julia. My daring Julia, what's wrong with you? [Person2]:  Steven, are you talking to me? [Person1]:  Yes, I have called you three times. What makes you in a daze? [Person2]:  I was thinking about the accident I saw in the morning. I was petrified when two cars collided. I witnessed the traffic accident. [Person1]:  Did someone get hurt? [Person2]:  A driver died instantly. The other one was badly hurt. A poor boy called Peter was killed in the accident too. [Person1]:  What a terrible accident! Who should be responsible for this traffic accident? [Person2]:  I think both. They drove too fast. What's worse, one of them was drunk. [Person1]:  Why do some guys like to drive so fast when they are drunk? [Person2]:  I don't understand. Maybe they feel they are okay and driving fast seems very cool.
[Person1]:  Come on in. Let me show you the house. Isn't it something? Spacious, bright and clean. And the walls were newly painted. Have you ever seen such a nice house? [Person2]:  Not really. [Person1]:  This is the kitchen. Every - thing's new. [Person2]:  It's great!

[Person2]:  What subjects did you like most at university? [Person1]:  I liked sales strategies most. [Person2]:  Why would you like to work with us? [Person1]:  It's an interesting job, and your company is one of the best known. Although I have no work experience as a salesperson, the job description you sent was very interesting. It's a job I've been dreaming of when I was at university. [Person2]:  What are your future plans and what kind of expectations do you have of the company? [Person1]:  I have an interest in marketing and I would consider graduate study in business in the future. I think my goals will become more clear as I gain experience in sales and marketing. [Person2]:  Good. Do you know anything about this company? [Person1]:  Yes, a little. As you mentioned just now, yours is an American capital company. As far as I know your company is a world famous one which produces cosmetics and skincare products. [Person2]:  Have you got anything to ask me? [Person1]:  Will traveling be required in this position? [Person2]:  Yes. [Person1]:  How often? [Person2]:  Three times a year at most. How do you feel about this? [Person1]:  That's fine.

[Person2]:  Two hundred and thirty-five yuan.  [Person1]:  OK, I'll take it. 
[Person1]:  Has your son started school yet, Tom?  [Person2]:  Next week, it's going to be quite a shock for him!  [Person1]:  He'll get used to it. They always do. I still remember when my daughter started. Are you going with him on his first day?  [Person2]:  You bet. I wouldn't miss it! 
[Person1]:  I was looking for books on small business startups and I think these are perfect. I'm going to start my own company in my back office. [Person2]:  That sounds interesting. So you'd like to check all these out? [Person1]:  Yes, for a few days at least. [Person2]:  No problem then. I'll just need to see your library card. [Person1]:  I'm afraid I've lost it. [Person2]:  That's alright. Could you just tell me your library account number? [Person1]:  I'm sorry. I don't remember it. [Person2]:  We can look it up for you. Just give me your username for the library website and I'll find your account number. [Person1]:  Oh, dear. I don't usually use the website.
[Person1]:  Did you see those robots? They were so smart. I can't believe how many different kinds there were at the technology show. They could do so many things too. Even activities that I thought could only be done by human hands. [Person2]:  It's really amazing. [Person1]:  I understand why they say that China's future is in robots, they will change society. [Person2]:  That's exactly what I'm afraid of. Can we predict what the consequences will be? [Person1]:  Well, it is hard to say. [Person2]:  I'm worried what the average person will experience as they communicate with robots on a daily basis. We are already surrounded by technology day and night in this modern society. Will some people completely lose the ability to form relationships with other people? These are some of the questions I'll be researching for my term paper. [Person1]:  I understand your concerns, but I think our country needs to become more competitive, with other countries that are also developing this technology. [Person2]:  We can ask professor Smith to talk a bit more about this in his next class.
[Person1]:  Alice, what's your favorite movie of the year twenty seventeen? [Person2]:  I must say it's Wonder Woman. When the movie was released in June last year, my parents were eager to take me to see it. [Person1]:  Why did your parents want to take you to watch it so much? [Person2]:  They considered it quite a different movie. You know, it is really rare to see a female action hero in a big budget movie. And it was also directed by a woman. I guess my parents wanted to show me that women could be powerful too. [Person1]:  So do you think that the movie was a big success? [Person2]:  You bet. It made more than 400 million dollars in ticket sales in the United States. In fact, there were only two bigger money makers among that years movies. [Person1]:  Did you watch any other movies directed by women in twenty seventeen? [Person2]:  Certainly. Women were in charge of more than 60 films in that year, including Before I Fall, Lady Bird and Battle of the Sexes. Among these three, I preferred the last.
[Person1]:  Could you tell me something about your family? [Person2]:  OK. There are five people in my family, Father, mother, elder brother, younger sister and I.

[Person2]:  My father is a middle school teacher. [Person1]:  What about your mother? [Person2]:  My mother is a housewife. [Person1]:  Are you married? [Person2]:  I am not married yet and I live alone now. [Person1]:  Do you need to support your family? [Person2]:  No, my father and brother are doing that. [Person1]:  Have you finished school? [Person2]:  Yes, I have already graduated.
[Person1]:  May I know where you are going? [Person2]:  Yes. I want to go to Beijing Hotel. [Person1]:  I'm sorry. You are going in the wrong direction. [Person2]:  Oh no! What shall I do? [Person1]:  Don't worry. You can get off at the next stop and go across the street through the overpass. The bus stop is right there. [Person2]:  Thank you very much. [Person1]:  My pleasure.
[Person1]:  Wei! This is a first time you didn't bargain! [Person2]:  Bargain? I'd feel way too guilty. [Person1]:  But you could have saved money. [Person2]:  From a sweet ma?! It's not worth it. Plus, I'd happily pay more for these things I bought! [Person1]:  F. Y. I . , there is a flea market nearby, but maybe you're done... [Person2]:  Ha! I'm just warming up! Please take me there now!
[Person1]:  Did you promise me to get the bread? [Person2]:  Well, I remember walking pass the baker shop. [Person1]:  But you forgot to get the bread. [Person2]:  I'm afraid so. I don't remember you telling me about it. [Person1]:  Well, I certainly did. [Person2]:  What would you let me do now? [Person1]:  You are free. You can go now. [Person2]:  Really? You are so kind. [Person1]:  I'll do with the cake. [Person2]:  No. That's not enough. I've got some cereal.
[Person1]:  How old are you, Su? [Person2]:  I am seven. [Person1]:  I see, you have seven candles on the cake. [Person2]:  Yes, I am seven. I am a big girl now. [Person1]:  We will have a party here, right? [Person2]:  Yes, come on, and we will have fun.
[Person1]:  Can you pick up some things from the store for me? [Person2]:  Of course, what do you need? [Person1]:  I need a few things, I'll give you the list. [Person2]:  Is there something else you need that you can think of? [Person1]:  Everything I need is on the list. [Person2]:  Do you want me to make any other stops while I'm out? [Person1]:  Since you asked, would you pick up my medicine from the pharmacy? [Person2]:  Is it ready to be picked up? [Person1]:  I believe so. [Person2]:  No problem. I'll do that for you. [Person1]:  I really appreciate you doing this for me. [Person2]:  It's no problem at all.
[Person1]:  There is a tornado warning on. My mother just told me she heard it on the radio. [Person2]:  What is a tornado warning? [Person1]:  It means that a tornado has been seen somewhere in the area. [Person2]:  Really? In New Berlin? [Person1]:  No. Not necessarily in town. But in southern Wisconsin somewhere. A tornado has been spotted. They have two stages here. This is what is called a ' tornado watch. ' That means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado. [Person2]:  I understand. They think a tornado might come. [Person1]:  Yes. People should look out, because maybe there will be tornadoes coming. So it's called a ' watch. ' [Person2]:  And the second stage is called a ' tornado warning '. [Person1]:  Yes. If a tornado has been spotted, they announce a ' tornado warning '. So if there's a tornado warning on, it means a tornado is out there somewhere. [Person2]:  It's scary. [Person1]:  Well. Tornadoes can be dangerous, it's true. If we hear something like a loud train coming, then we have to go in the basement. [Person2]:  What do you mean ' a loud train '? [Person1]:  That is what tornadoes sound like. They sound like trains. They're very loud. [Person2]:  But if you hear them coming, isn't it already too late? [Person1]:  Maybe. It depends on the tornado. Some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour. That is very fast. Others aren't so fast. [Person2]:  Have you seen a lot of them? [Person1]:  I've only seen one in my life. I was looking out the window. It was around two miles away. It was very interesting to watch. But it was heading toward my friend's house. So I quickly called them on the phone. [Person2]:  Did it hit their house? [Person1]:  No, it didn't. But they are glad I called them. [Person2]:  What were they doing when you called? [Person1]:  They were all sitting in the living room watching TV. They had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house. If it had hit them, they could have all been killed. [Person2]:  That's terrible. Do many people die in tornadoes? [Person1]:  Not so many really. But a lot of houses are destroyed sometimes.
[Person1]:  Oh, hi Pam. When did you get back from Canada? How was it? [Person2]:  The day before yesterday. I only visited Montreal and Ottawa, but I had a great time. [Person1]:  Which city did you like better? [Person2]:  That's hard to say. . . I think Ottawa is prettier. It has better sightseeing, too. A lot of museums and galleries. [Person1]:  And what's Montreal like? What did you think of it? [Person2]:  Montreal is more exciting. It has better shopping. The stores are cheaper and more interesting. [Person1]:  Which one has better nightlife? [Person2]:  Oh, Montreal of sure. It has more restaurants and clubs. They say Montreal is the most exciting city in Canada. [Person1]:  Well, I've always wanted to see Vancouver. I've heard it has the most beautiful views.
[Person1]:  So, have you seen all three The Lord of the Rings movies? [Person2]:  Yes, but I didn't really like the third one at all. [Person1]:  That's the Return of the King, right? [Person2]:  Yeah. Even though the customs were brilliant, I didn't think it was as good as the first two. What did you think? [Person1]:  I thought the special effects were amazing, but I got a bit confused. The plot was too complicated for me. [Person2]:  Did you read the books before you watched the movies? [Person1]:  No. did you? [Person2]:  Yes, I've read them many times. I think it's much easier to follow for people who were already familiar with all the characters. [Person1]:  Yes, trying to keep track of all the characters was quite confusing for me. [Person2]:  I also think that it was much better in the theatre than at home. [Person1]:  Most movies are. Another problem for me was the film was dubbed in German with English subtitles. [Person2]:  That happens a lot in non-English speaking countries. [Person1]:  I heard that The Return of the King was nominated for 11 Oscars. [Person2]:  Actually, they not only had 11 nominations, but they won 11 Oscars, too!
[Person1]:  Are you a happy married man? [Person2]:  Yes, I am. My wife and I understand each other. [Person1]:  You are a lucky man. How about Mr. Smith. [Person2]:  I don't know. But they say that Mrs. Smith wears the pants in the house. [Person1]:  You mean she bosses her husband around? [Person2]:  That's right. She is pretty, but she wants to control everything in his life.
[Person1]:  I'd love that. I'm so glad I quit. It's time for a change. [Person2]:  Does that mean you're going to take my advice? [Person1]:  Yes. I'm looking for a position as a chef. [Person2]:  I might be able to help. . . [Person1]:  I'm sure you have great connections. [Person2]:  We'd like to open another restaurant. . . with you as the head chef and manager. . . [Person1]:  Really? You have that much faith in me? And Giovanni agreed to it? Does he know who I am? [Person2]:  Yes. But you know him. He's just worried that you're not Italian. . . [Person1]:  He's prejudiced, isn't he? [Person2]:  No. He's afraid that no one will cook as good as his mother did. [Person1]:  Ah! I know a way to convince him that Americans can make good Italian food! [Person2]:  How's that? [Person1]:  You'll see next week. I'll come by one day at lunchtime.
[Person1]:  Kenvir? Hi, it's Alice. I'm very sorry that I have a big favor to ask you again. [Person2]:  How big, Alice? Last time you said that, I ended up working overtime 4 nights. [Person1]:  Well, I've got a huge load of typing and Mr. Brown has insisted I get it done by tomorrow afternoon. Could you help me to type half of it? [Person2]:  All right, Alice. But this is the last time. I also have a lot of work to do. [Person1]:  Thank you, Kenvir. You're so kind.
[Person1]:  I'm a bit worried about you going shopping by yourself this afternoon. [Person2]:  Oh don't worry, I'll be fine. [Person1]:  But what will you do if you need to know the price of something? [Person2]:  If I need to know the price, I'll just look at the label. [Person1]:  Ok, but what will you do if you want to check the size of the clothes? [Person2]:  I'll try them on. [Person1]:  And what will you do if you don't have enough cash? [Person2]:  Then I'll just use my credit card.
[Person1]:  I'd like to buy these shoes. [Person2]:  O. K. Let me see. That will be $ 104. 99. [Person1]:  The price tag says $ 99. 99. [Person2]:  Yes, miss, but there is a five percent sales tax in Maryland. [Person1]:  Oh, of course. How silly of me to forget. [Person2]:  No problem. How would you like to pay for these? [Person1]:  I think I have the cash. Let me check. Yes, here you are. [Person2]:  $ 110. 00, your change is $ 5. 01. Thanks very much. [Person1]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  Ten sheets of rice paper, 25 brushes, two boxes of oil color and two boxes of water color. All these come up to $ 35. 50, sir. [Person2]:  Ok, here is $ 50. Oh, can you make out an invoice for me? [Person1]:  Sure, just a minute. Are you an artist, sir? [Person2]:  No, I am a teacher. I teach art. [Person1]:  That must be a very interesting job. [Person2]:  It is. You must be new here. I do my shopping here regularly, once a week. [Person1]:  Do you? Nice to meet you! And here is the invoice and your change. [Person2]:  Thank you. Nice to meet you, too.
[Person1]:  Thank you for your application, Mr. Sweeney. Mr. Jacobs would like to set up an interview for early next week. Do you have time? [Person2]:  Yes, ma'am. I could come in any day next week, except for Friday morning. [Person1]:  Fine. Let me take a look at his schedule. He's free on Tuesday afternoon at 1 [Person2]:  Yes. That would be fine.
[Person1]:  Hello, Sir. Can I help you with anything? [Person2]:  Yes, I would like to use the ATM to make a payment. But I need to pay 3 parties at once. [Person1]:  No problem at all. With this service, you can pay up to 10 parties at one time. Are these parties on your current beneficiaries list? [Person2]:  They are, yes. How should I do this? [Person1]:  Select'pay multiple beneficiaries', here. . . then select'pay from the account'in the drop down menu. . . OK, good. Then we need to enter the beneficiary statement reference. [Person2]:  Yes, I've got that here. . . [Person1]:  And your statement reference and the payment amount. Click on next, then'pay beneficiaries'. That's it! All done.
[Person1]:  Good evening, sir, madam. A table for two? [Person2]:  No, thank you. But we have a small problem. Can you help us? [Person1]:  Sure. What can I do for you? [Person2]:  We are looking for a hotel. Are there any hotels near here? [Person1]:  Yes, there are some hotels in the street. The nearest one is next to the bank. It's quite modern. [Person2]:  Do you think there're any inexpensive ones nearby? We're leaving tomorrow morning. [Person1]:  Yes. Drive west for about two minutes and you will find a grey building on the right side. It's a traditional family style hotel, very comfortable, and the price is quite reasonable. [Person2]:  It sounds nice. Thank you very much for your help. [Person1]:  That's all right.
[Person1]:  Packages Express. May I help you? [Person2]:  Yes. Hi. I sent a package last Thursday, and I'd like to track my order. [Person1]:  No problem. I can check the shipment on the computer for you. This Monday's order... Let me see. Ah, it's here, last Thursday. Do you have your order number? [Person2]:  Sure. It's 6-0-1-4-2-8. [Person1]:  OK. And the last name on that order? [Person2]:  It's Conley. That's C-O-N-L-E-Y. [Person1]:  And where did you send the package to? [Person2]:  San Francisco. [Person1]:  Mm-hmm. And the postal code there is 9-5-1-2-6. Yes, it looks like the pack arrived safely on Tuesday morning. Your friend can get the package at the counter numbered 4-2-3-6. [Person2]:  That's great. Thank you very much for your help. [Person1]:  You're welcome.
[Person1]:  Did you read the story in the paper, Robin? [Person2]:  What story, Grandma? [Person1]:  Due to lack of money for repainting the building and for the furniture needed, the plans for the community center have been put off. [Person2]:  Is that a serious problem, Grandma? [Person1]:  It is. Especially for my friend Nat, he doesn't have any family with him. He lives alone and depends on places like a community center to be with people of his own age. [Person2]:  But there's the old community center. [Person1]:  It's small and the problem is that it set up mainly for kids to play. It's too noisy for some older people like Nat. [Person2]:  I see what you mean now. There is a way, Grandma. You may get your friends to work. I can get some of my friends to go around the neighborhood and collect the furniture.
[Person1]:  I have just received a letter from Beck. [Person2]:  Really? What does he say? [Person1]:  Beck says that the wheat is ready for harvest, and he's thinking of buying some fields next year. [Person2]:  Oh, he must be doing the work well. [Person1]:  Yes, I think he is, he's proud of having the largest farm in Oregon. [Person2]:  I guess you're looking forward to seeing him. [Person1]:  You are right. In fact, I'm thinking of visiting him next week. I want to help with the harvest on the farm. [Person2]:  We really need to have much outdoor exercise. When I was young, I was quite good at farming. [Person1]:  When I was on the farm in my childhood, I liked watering the flowers, riding horses and feeding the chickens. [Person2]:  Yes, I like farm work, too. Last time when I was at my brothers. I once tried my hand at milking a cow. It was interesting.
[Person1]:  I'm here with Margaret Seabrook, the CEO of creative toys. In today's show, we're going to discuss the hottest new toy of two thousand seventeen, the Super Spinner. Margaret, welcome. [Person2]:  Thank you, Brian. It's great to be here. [Person1]:  OK, so tell us about this new toy. [Person2]:  Well. It's similar to a relaxation ball in its function, but it's useful for anyone who has problems focusing. [Person1]:  So how does it work? [Person2]:  It's about the size of a cookie and it has 3 small round parts that can move in any direction. Basically, you just hold it in between your thumb and middle finger and spin it. That's it. [Person1]:  That's it? [Person2]:  Yeah, it's very popular. Not only with children, but with adults as well. [Person1]:  A professor at MIT by the name of Jill Mean Lee has publicly stated there is no scientific or medical evidence for your claims about its benefits. Many schools also have banned the toy, saying it leads to a lack of focus in the classroom. [Person2]:  Well, that professor is allowed to have her opinion. [Person1]:  Fair enough, and who invented it? [Person2]:  Catherine Hettinger, a chemical engineer, was first believed to be its creator. But then we found that an IT professional named Scott McCoskry was the actual inventor. [Person1]:  It's time for a commercial break. More with Margaret Seabrook in a moment.
[Person1]:  So who does he think he is, anyway, I can't believe the way that my boss has been ordering everyone around lately, I mean, it's now like he is the CEO, or anything. [Person2]:  Um. . . Actually I am guessing you didn't get the MEMO. Your boss was selected to fill the vacancy in the CEO slot. He actually is the CEO now, or will be, as soon as the official press releases and hoopla is done with. [Person1]:  Yikes! you are joking, right? I can't believe it. No wonder he is so stressed and bossy lately. I thought he was just being ostentatious by giving orders to people and all the different departments. What big shoes to fill! [Person2]:  No kidding! When the last CEO left, we were worried about the future of the company. [Person1]:  What does a CEO do anyway? I know the CEO makes the most money in the company, but what does he actually do? [Person2]:  He is responsible to the board of directors for everything that happens in the company. He or she must give leadership to all company officers, as CEO is also responsible for providing the guidance of philosophy of the company, and acting as official representative, or face of the company. [Person1]:  Must be one smart guy.
[Person1]:  Which film shall we see? [Person2]:  There is nothing good at the moment. Let's do something different. Would you like to go to a concert? [Person1]:  Yes, I'd love to. Here is a good one, Mozart and Beethoven. It's on the Festival Hall. [Person2]:  Fine! Do you want anything to eat now? [Person1]:  No, I'm not hungry. [Person2]:  Well, let's go and have something to drink instead. I know a good place. It's a little expensive, but it's fun.
[Person1]:  Lousy weather, isn't it? [Person2]:  It has stopped snowing, but it's even colder. [Person1]:  Look at the ice there hanging from the eaves. [Person2]:  And the streets are covered with snow. [Person1]:  Do you know what the temperature is today? [Person2]:  I missed today's weather forecast over the TV. [Person1]:  It feels like ten degrees below zero at least. I don't mind the cold weather but I do hate it when it gets slippery. [Person2]:  The ice will soon be thick enough for skating. I am so fond of winter sports. [Person1]:  That's great. Let's go skating together tomorrow.
[Person1]:  OK, Ann, you spent quite a bit of time in Australia recently so why don't you talk about that? [Person2]:  I really liked living in Australia. I was an international student and I studied education at the university of Sydney. And living in Sydney was fantasticbecuase I could go to the beach anytime I wanted and there was a great nightlife in Sydney. There are lots of great clubs. And people were very, very friendly and easy-going and I met a lot of international people in living Sydney. [Person1]:  Mm-hm. How long were you there? [Person2]:  I was there for almost a year. [Person1]:  Oh, OK. [Person2]:  And I travelled a little bit in Australia. I went up the east coast. Up to Frasier Island. Which is a world heritage site. And I saw dingo running along the beach and sharks in the water. We climbed cliffs and went through a rain forest and went camping and then we went up to the. . . , which is a but north. And the further north you go in Australia, the hotter it gets. So we were able to go swimming in the ocean and I went diving for the first time but it was a little bit risky cause I didn't have a diving license, so I went on an introductory dive and I saw a giant clam that had a really purple spongy inside that I was able to touch and then the clam closed up really quickly. [Person1]:  So, did you, did you lose your finger? [Person2]:  Almost. [Person1]:  Almost. Ah, you're lucky. Um, it's funny, you go in the water and you worry about sharks, but not clams. [Person2]:  Exactly. [Person1]:  Will you be going back to Australia soon? [Person2]:  I'd like to go and live there for at least another year. Probably I'll go back to Sydney or maybe I'll go down to Melbourne because it's a really interesting cultural city. They have lot of museums and parks.
[Person1]:  Hello, Mr. Green. This is Lin Tong. How are you? [Person2]:  Hi, Mr. Lin. I am leaving tomorrow and I am just packing. [Person1]:  Oh, sorry to interrupt you. But I am calling to say goodbye to you. I am awfully sorry to tell you that I am afraid I could not see you off at the airport tomorrow, because I will have to attend a very important meeting. [Person2]:  It doesn't matter, Mr. Lin. I can understand. I know you are always very busy. Work must come first. [Person1]:  Thanks a lot. You have been here for almost three weeks. How time flies! [Person2]:  Yes. And I would like to convey my thanks to you for your help during my stay here in Nanjing. [Person1]:  It is our pleasure. It has been a great pleasure to work with you. [Person2]:  Me too. I am looking forward to cooperating with you again. [Person1]:  Really? Great! We will. Well, what's your flight number? When are you leaving tomorrow? [Person2]:  It's Flight No. 104, Northey Airlines, which leaves at ten O'dock tomorrow evening. [Person1]:  OK, I will send someone to see you off. [Person2]:  That is so thoughtful of you. [Person1]:  My pleasure. Take care and have a nice trip. [Person2]:  Thanks a lot. My wife and I will be welcoming and looking forward to your visit. [Person1]:  Let's call it a deal. Hope to see you again soon. Keep in touch then. Byebye. [Person2]:  Goodbye. Thanks again.
[Person1]:  Can you believe me? [Person2]:  Sure. [Person1]:  Please count on my love. [Person2]:  I will. [Person1]:  I'll be yours through endless time. [Person2]:  I see. And I'll always be devoted to you. [Person1]:  Thank you. I know I've nothing to offer you, but I'll never give you reason to cry. [Person2]:  I'll never hurt you ; I'll never lie. [Person1]:  My love will grow, like a river to flow. [Person2]:  It can't be dry, and can't die. [Person1]:  I don't know whether we are in a dream. [Person2]:  Aha, Aha. . .
[Person1]:  We'Ve got a lot of work to do now, but take your time over this project. We don't want to make any mistakes. [Person2]:  Ok. I should have it finished by Friday afternoon. Then I can check those account over the weekend. We need to have them finished by Monday, right? [Person1]:  That's right. We'll finish them just in time. The Macy project can wait for the time being. We need to spend several days on that project, but it isn't due to be finished until the end of the month, so we have plenty of time to get it done. [Person2]:  Some next week on, we should be in less of a rush. [Person1]:  I'm going to give everyone on the team an extra day off. Everyone deserves it. [Person2]:  Don't say that yet. A new project could suddenly appear. [Person1]:  That's true. Right. I'm going back to the meeting. It's been going on for hours and there's no indication that it'll end soon. [Person2]:  Carol said that she would spend some time checking that everyone is up-to-date with their work. [Person1]:  Good. I have to go right now. I really hope this meeting doesn't last too long. [Person2]:  They usually go on for ages. [Person1]:  I'll stop by if I have time later. Make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the deadlines. [Person2]:  I will. Enjoy your meeting!
[Person1]:  Hello, Sir. We haven't seen you for quite a while. So, what is it today that we can do for you? [Person2]:  I need a Deposit Certificate to handle some stuff in land. [Person1]:  I see, yes, I can do that now. I'm sure you know, as I may have told you before, you should pay an extra 20 RMB handling fee for this service. [Person2]:  Yes, I recalled you charging that before. And I thought it was extortionate! Haha! [Person1]:  I can just take it from your account, you don't need to give me cash. [Person2]:  OK. . . so it'll come out of my account? Well, that makes it much easier. [Person1]:  Anything else you'll be needing today, Sir? [Person2]:  Nope. That's everything, thanks.
[Person1]:  Are these your triplets? They're beautiful! I'Ve seen other babies who were nothing but skin and bones at their age. You know, they're absolutely identical of you and John! Are you planning on having any more? [Person2]:  Bite your tongue! I'm already at the end of my rope. Some nights I don't sleep at all. John manages to sleep like a log even when the babies are screaming at the top of their lungs. [Person1]:  Well, tell me. How was the labor and delivery? [Person2]:  I wouldn't say that I had the time of my life but at least everything went without a hitch. [Person1]:  Well, hang in there. In twenty years, you'll fell it was well worth it!
[Person1]:  Albert? Could you co-sign this approval sheet? Accounting's getting really picky. [Person2]:  I know. They'Ve already sent back two approvals I sent them. Where do I sign?

[Person1]:  May I help you? [Person2]:  Yes. I would like to go to New York for my Christmas vacation. [Person1]:  How long do you have? [Person2]:  1 week. Would you recommend me scenic spots to see there? [Person1]:  New York is full of place of interest, such as Times Square, Broadway, Wall street and Ground Zero and Statue of Liberty. [Person2]:  That's fantastic.
[Person1]:  Hello! How do I get online with my laptop? [Person2]:  Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer, and you'll be online in a heartbeat. [Person1]:  Well, I see the cable. But my computer runs on wireless only. [Person2]:  No problem. I'll tell you about our alternatives. [Person1]:  Yes, I'd love to hear what the alternatives are. [Person2]:  Our state-of-the-art computer lab is on the first floor. [Person1]:  Great! But is it free? [Person2]:  Sir, the computers are free to guests, but you do have to pay a nominal printing fee. [Person1]:  You said there were other alternatives? [Person2]:  Just use your computer here in the lobby. It's set up for wireless. [Person1]:  Okay. That sounds like a winner. Now if I need to print something in the lobby? [Person2]:  We might have a printer here next month. But for now, you'll have to go to the lab.
[Person1]:  Can you tell me what the unit price of such carpet is? [Person2]:  Of course, here is the catalogue and the price list. You can have a look. We also have many other kinds of carpets. [Person1]:  The price seems acceptable for me. But I want to check whether you can supply the carpets now if we order some? [Person2]:  Of course we can. We can provide the quantity you ask for. [Person1]:  That's very good. Shall we sign a contract now? [Person2]:  No problem. Let's check the terms of contract.
[Person1]:  Hello. May I help you? [Person2]:  Yes, please. I've been here for nearly two months, but I still haven't found a job. Do you think you can find one for me? [Person1]:  Don't worry, we'll try to help you. Will you please fill out this form? [Person2]:  What's this form for? [Person1]:  This is for registration. After you have given us your personal details, we'll match these against new jobs as they come in. And we'll contact you when there is a job that suits you. [Person2]:  That's great. But how long do I have to wait? [Person1]:  Maybe several weeks, maybe several months. It's hard to tell. [Person2]:  Oh, dear. How can I wait for such a long time? [Person1]:  Actually, many jobs are filled by people who select vacancies from the display boards there. [Person2]:  Then, what do you think I should do? [Person1]:  My advice is to keep looking for jobs yourself. Check the job boards at the job center regularly and check the newspapers daily. If you have friends or relatives here, ask them for help, too. [Person2]:  I see. Thank you very much for your advice. Bye. [Person1]:  Keep in touch.
[Person1]:  Hello, Robert speaking. [Person2]:  Hi, it's Emma. I'm glad you're there. It's about our appointment on Wednesday morning. I'm afraid I can't make it now. [Person1]:  Oh, that's a shame. [Person2]:  I'm sorry. There was a change in my business partner's plan. And Wednesday is the only day she is able to see me. [Person1]:  That's okay. But we need to find another date. [Person2]:  I could manage sometime Thursday. How about you? [Person1]:  Sorry, I got an important meeting all day. What about Friday?

[Person1]:  I've gotta hand it to you, you really did a good job!  [Person2]:  So glad that you think so!  [Person1]:  I think you deserve a promotion.  [Person2]:  Oh, really? Thanks a lot... well, I still have a lot to learn, I guess. 
[Person1]:  Have you had any kind of punishment in your college?  [Person2]:  Yes, but it was many years ago.  [Person1]:  What was it for?  [Person2]:  I was a naughty boy and I played hooky. So the school gave me a punishment to clear the classroom for a week. 
[Person1]:  I have had some really horrible headaches lately.  [Person2]:  How long have your headaches been going on?

[Person2]:  Has anything hit you in the head lately?  [Person1]:  I hit my head on a cupboard door a week ago.  [Person2]:  Let's have you come back in a few days and see how you feel. 
[Person1]:  You look a little uncomfortable. What's the matter? [Person2]:  Oh, I just don't eat Thai food very much. [Person1]:  Would you like me to order you something else or would you rather go to that new Italian restaurant? [Person2]:  No, we came here to eat, so let's eat. Maybe I'll just add some salt. [Person1]:  Really? It's no problem. I don't want you to feel forced into eating something you don't like. [Person2]:  It's fine really. I need to try new things.
[Person1]:  A  [Person2]:  B  [Person1]:  A  [Person2]:  B  [Person1]:  A  [Person2]:  B

Really? Who? [Person1]:  I don't know. I saw him the first time Tuesday. He was at the cafe. I noticed he was looking at me a lot. Not just the usual looking, but staring. He just kept staring at me. He didn't stop. [Person2]:  What did you do? [Person1]:  I didn't do anything. Finally, he left. But then I saw him again today. Outside the shoe store. Near the cafe. I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's. But then he came in too. [Person2]:  Did he leave when you left? [Person1]:  Yes. Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me. He was following me. [Person2]:  What did you do?
[Person1]:  Good morning, I am Monica. Are you Mr. White, the manager of finance department? I am the newcomer and also working in the finance department. [Person2]:  Yes, that is me.

Peter saw it a few months ago, and according to him, some of it was violent, but it was all done in a very 'matter-of-fact' way. Nothing to... eh... you know... [Person1]:  OK, then. I suppose it will make a change from comedies.
[Person1]:  How are your French lessons going? [Person2]:  Well, I'm no longer taking French lessons. [Person1]:  Are you kidding? You told me you made up your mind to study French well this summer. Didn't you sign up for the four-week course? [Person2]:  I did. But the teacher told me not to come back any more after only one week and he returned my money for the remaining three weeks. [Person1]:  How come? I've never heard of a case like that before. Did you have a quarrel with your teacher? [Person2]:  Of course not. At first everything went well and he was satisfied with me. But he got angry after I broke the class rules several times. [Person1]:  It was your fault, I think. You'd gone too far. [Person2]:  Perhaps. But I don't understand why he told me to stop coming. He was very kind, you know. [Person1]:  Just forget it.

[Person2]:  A higher discount will be given for a big order, so we are willing to give you a 5 % discount this time. [Person1]:  The Iranians will give us a 10 % discount if such a high order is placed with them. No doubt you know an incentive discount encourages the buyers and helps expand seller's business. [Person2]:  Of course I know. But there is too high a rate. Frankly speaking, the maximum discount we can make is 6 %.
[Person1]:  Hi, Lucy, you are very popular with people around you, what are your tricks? [Person2]:  Thank you for saying so. I don't know, probably because I like sharing my experience and knowledge with them. I think this kind of communication helps to improve our work efficiency and also helps to get along with colleagues. [Person1]:  Sharing knowledge can be very settled and some second stances. People may think you are telling them how to do their work. If they take it personally, they feel angry at you and even become reluctant to support you at work. [Person2]:  That is true. Some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way. For example, it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people. To show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off. [Person1]:  You are quite right. Thank you for sharing your experience with me. I learned a lot. [Person2]:  You're welcome.
[Person1]:  Lucy, I'd like to fix the light in the corridor, it keeps flashing, which drives me crazy. Would you like to help me with the ladder? [Person2]:  Monica, wait a moment. I think we'd better call the repair man to do it. [Person1]:  I think I can handle it by myself. [Person2]:  I'd like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company. [Person1]:  I see. If I got hurt when fixing the light, even during office hours, I wouldn't get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility. [Person2]:  Other company rules also need your attention. [Person1]:  Like this one? [Person2]:  Never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder. [Person1]:  Yeah, thank you for telling me. [Person2]:  Don't mention it.
[Person1]:  Good morning, sir. Is there anything I can do for you? [Person2]:  Yes, I would like to have a suit made to measure. [Person1]:  Sure. How do you like your suit? [Person2]:  I want a single breasted suit. Here is the cloth.

[Person2]:  I like chocolate myself. [Person1]:  Is there any kind of ice cream you don't like? [Person2]:  I really don't like any ice cream with nuts in it. [Person1]:  I haven't ever cared for that myself. [Person2]:  Have you ever had garlic ice cream? [Person1]:  That sounds absolutely disgusting! [Person2]:  It was. Let's stick with the regular choices today, though.
[Person1]:  Can I collect unemployment benefits? [Person2]:  Are you still working? [Person1]:  My employer cut back on my hours. [Person2]:  If you got laid off or are working a lot fewer hours, you may qualify. [Person1]:  Do I definitely get to collect unemployment? [Person2]:  Not all jobs pay into unemployment insurance, so their employees cannot collect benefits. [Person1]:  How do I check out my status to collect unemployment? [Person2]:  You should have noticed unemployment insurance being deducted from your paycheck. Check your pay stubs. [Person1]:  How much will my unemployment check be? [Person2]:  The more money you made, the more you will earn on unemployment. They have a formula.

[Person1]:  Well, what shampoo do you prefer? [Person2]:  SEEK, please. [Person1]:  ( 5 minutes later ) What sort of hairstyles do you like? [Person2]:  What hairstyle do you feel will look best on me? [Person1]:  I think a crew cut is the most suitable for you. [Person2]:  I have the same idea as you.
[Person1]:  Professor Wang, what is non-tariff barrier? [Person2]:  Non-tariff barrier is another mean to restrict imports. [Person1]:  Can you give an example? [Person2]:  For example, some countries restrict imports by quantitative restriction. [Person1]:  Why? [Person2]:  This is used to protect local industries or to achieve certain political objectives. [Person1]:  Oh, Are there other means? [Person2]:  Technical barriers are set for imported goods. [Person1]:  This is designed to exclude them from domestic market, isn't it? [Person2]:  Yes, some countries may use some of the unnecessary health rules to exclude foreign food.

I think I'll hold off on buying other books for now. [Okay.] Teachers are always changing their minds about textbooks. [Alright.] And, what are those books? [Person1]:  Which ones? Ah, ah, nothing. Never mind. [Person2]:  Wait, wait, wait. Finding Your Perfect Someone. You're selling it for forty dollars? What's, what's this all about? And the price? [Person1]:  Well. You .. It's a ... It's just a marital relations class. You know about finding a partner. You know, mom's always, you know, on me about that. What does it matter to you anyway? [Person2]:  Forty dollars? That's a little expense. [Person1]:  Well, they guarantee results, but ah, never mind. You would never understand. [Person2]:  What about this one? Introduction to Gourmet Cooking? Why did you take this class? You hate cooking. [Person1]:  Well, um, I have a friend who's into cooking, and she's [She?] ... I mean, my friend's taking the class. I mean, ugh, does it really matter?

[Person2]:  To be honest, I like all of them except the math teacher. Though he must be quite young, he seems like an old person. He's so boring. [Person1]:  That's too bad. How is your English teacher? [Person2]:  She is great. In today's class, she gave us a lecture on how to be a good student. She told us not to push ourselves hard for exams, but to pay more attention to communicating than memorizing. [Person1]:  Did she give you any homework? [Person2]:  Not today, she wanted us to relax tonight instead of doing homework. [Person1]:  No wonder you like the class so much.

[Person2]:  It's important to do proper exercises. [Person1]:  You're right. Too much or too little won't do any good. [Person2]:  The trainer tells me, besides regular sports activities, I should also have a healthy and balanced diet. [Person1]:  Sounds reasonable. [Person2]:  We should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic. [Person1]:  And fruits! [Person2]:  Surely it is. Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness. [Person1]:  I've heard that. Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit? [Person2]:  Yeah, he advises me to stay in a good mood. That can also help one to keep sound physical health.

[Person2]:  Everyone wants to earn a lot of money. Don't you think so? What's more, I am interested in money management. [Person1]:  No, you are wrong. Money can't buy happiness and health. I won't sacrifice my health in order to get money. In other words, I don't want to be a millionaire and I want to have more free time to enjoy life. [Person2]:  Oh, I see. But a proverb says ' Money makes the mare go. ' I think it will be better if you have more money. [Person1]:  Maybe you are right. Please take care of yourself when you make money.

[Person1]:  Do you use an anti-virus program to protect your computer? [Person2]:  Yes, I do. I also use an anti-spyware program and a firewall. There are so many nasties on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users. You have to be very careful and keep you computer clean. [Person1]:  How often do you run your anti-virus program? [Person2]:  I usually run it every few days. It finds a virus about half the time. [Person1]:  Which anti-virus program would you recommend? [Person2]:  How you tried this one? It's very good and you can download it for free on the internet. You can also download updates for free. [Person1]:  That sounds very good. Which website should I visit to download it? [Person2]:  Just a minute. . . go to this one. I'll send you an email with the line in it. It only takes a few minutes to download.

[Person1]:  You work without payment? That's really something. [Person2]:  When will you leave for home? [Person1]:  Tomorrow. We'll fly to Hawaii two days after. I really have to pack now. [Person2]:  Go then. Have a nice vacation! [Person1]:  I'll send you postcards.
[Person1]:  Sir, I've finished your shaving. Wow, it takes years off you after having a shave. [Person2]:  Really? You've done a good job. [Person1]:  Thank you. May I suggest you to trim your eyebrows? [Person2]:  I have never heard that men would trim their eyebrows. Are you kidding? [Person1]:  No, sir, I am serious. Haven't you heard that today men are becoming increasingly interested in having their eyebrows professionally groomed? [Person2]:  Do you mean that it is a trend for men to trim their eyebrows? [Person1]:  Absolutely. Several men have tried it in my A shop. Do you want to try? [Person2]:  Yeah, let me have a try.
[Person1]:  Hey, Robert, that's a nice shirt you are wearing. Where did you get it? [Person2]:  thanks, I like it too. I bought it at the nearby department store. [Person1]:  that's nice. Do you know you can get one at the wholesale market near the zoo for a much lower price? [Person2]:  yeah, I know that. But at those places. the prices they ask you are ridiculously high, and if you don't bargain hard, you will get ripped-off. [Person1]:  true, learning how to haggle the price is one of the things people have to pick up when they come to China for the first time. [Person2]:  yeah, but personally, I hate bargaining. If I bargain, I might come to a lower price, but I will never know the true price of what I am buying ; and I always have the feeling that I am overcharged at th [Person1]:  yeah, I have the same feeling. Also there is another thing that bothers me the quality. Things in a department store are usually quality-guaranteed. But at a wholesale market, you never know whether w [Person2]:  that's why I like department stores more. Shopping at a wholesale market like the locals is one of the few things I am unable to grow accustomed to. [Person1]:  I understand. While it's always good to follow the local customs, I guess there are exceptions.
[Person1]:  Tom, is Jenny crying? [Person2]:  Can you take he away from me? [Person1]:  I'm just coming for that. [Person2]:  She kept on bothering me. [Person1]:  She's your sister. What she asked was only duck soup for you. Why can't you be good to her? [Person2]:  But I am her brother, not her servant.
[Person1]:  What are you doing, Jane? [Person2]:  I am planning for a party. [Person1]:  A party? What party? Your birthday party? [Person2]:  Of course not. My birthday is in December. Don't you remember? It's the company's party. The general manager wants to invite some famous scientists and bankers and professors from universities to the party, since these people are very important to the development of the company. [Person1]:  Have you finished your plan? [Person2]:  Finished? You must be joking. I have just started. I still need to get a lot more information and I'll have to write many invitation letters. [Person1]:  Can I help you? [Person2]:  Would you? That would be very nice. Let me tell you what to do first.
[Person1]:  I hear there will be a football competition between all senior schools next month. Is that so? [Person2]:  That's true. [Person1]:  Would you please go into some more details? [Person2]:  Well, the competition will be held in our school and it will begin on August 11. The competition will last a whole week. [Person1]:  Anything else? [Person2]:  Yes, both the girls and boys competition will be held at the same time. The girls competition will be held in the morning and the boys competition will be held in the afternoon. [Person1]:  Yes? Sounds exciting. [Person2]:  We are both members of our school football team. We should be ready for it. [Person1]:  Of course. It's a long time since we had the last football competition last time. I'm really looking forward to another competition. [Person2]:  Me, too.
[Person1]:  Hi. Welcome to Joe's Hamburger Restaurant. [Hi] Home of the one-pound super deluxe hot and spicy cheeseburger. Will this be for here or to go? [Person2]:  Uh, to go. [Person1]:  Okay. What would you like today? Would you like to try the one-pound super hot and spicy cheeseburger? [Person2]:  Uh. I don't think so. I'd probably have heartburn for a week after downing that monster. [Person1]:  Well. It's our house special this week, and it comes with fries, and a large specialty drink called 'Everything-but-the-kitchen-sink.' [Person2]:  A what? 'Everything-but-the-kitchen-sink'? What in the world is that? [Person1]:  Well, it's a little mix of everything in a large cup [Person2]:  Ah, that sounds disgusting. [Person1]:  Hey, it'll grow on you. [Person2]:  Nay, I think I'll just order a hamburger with some mustard and lettuce and a glass of water. [Person1]:  Boring. Hey. Would you care for anything else like a side order of amazing cheesy onion rings? [Person2]:  No thank you. Onion rings usually don't agree with me. [Person1]:  Hmm. Okay. Your total comes to ten ninety ($10.90). [Person2]:  Ten ninety? For just a hamburger?! You've got to be kidding [Person1]:  Well, the one-pound super deluxe hamburger is nine dollars. [Person2]:  Hey, I didn't order a one-pound burger. I just wanted a simple burger. That's all. [Person1]:  Well, sir. Joe's Hamburger Restaurant only serves one-pound burgers. [Man!] The one-pound super hot and spicy, the one-pound barbecue burger, the one-pound bacon cheese burger, the one-pound ... [Person2]:  No, no. Those are all huge. [Person1]:  Well, sir. If you really want something smaller [Yeah], you should order from the kids' menu [Person2]:  No. Those are still giant burgers. [Person1]:  Well, in these parts, we are hearty eaters. [Person2]:  Okay, but you said my total was ten ninety, but the burger only comes to ten bucks. What about the other ninety cents? [Person1]:  Well, sir. We only serve natural spring water from yonder hills, and ... [Person2]:  Okay, okay. I'll take the giant burger and a bottle of your spring water. The sandwich should feed me for a week.
[Person1]:  Chris,I would like to know, what kind of food you eat in Belgium. [Person2]:  We have our fish, our meat, our wines, our fruit ... [Person1]:  I mean what is popular about Belgian food? [Person2]:  Well, it's a bit different in Belgium as I think it is here in New York. We really enjoy the tables. We don't go out for dinner that often but when we go out we stay at a table for three or four hours. It starts with appetizers, then it may be a soup, then it's the main dish, then it's still an ice-cream or something. [Person1]:  It takes so much time to have dinner in your country! [Person2]:  Yeah. We really enjoy eating and it goes slow. Last winter, a friend from Portugal went to Belgium with me. For Christmas dinner, we met at 5 [Person1]:  Wow! You must be fat there if you eat that much. [Person2]:  In fact we don't. We don't do it that often, but if we do, then of course the next day or the next few days you see people just don't eat much.
[Person1]:  Do you want to sign for a Korea language class?  [Person2]:  What for? Oh, I see, you mean next year our company will expand business to the South Korea market.  [Person1]:  Right, we have located a business partner in Seoul. The first contact proves to be successful. The general manager of South Korean company has scheduled to pay a visit to us next month. I think it is quite possible to set up a joint venture company with them soon.  [Person2]:  Well, sounds promising. But I think our company will provide us with the language training courses if it is necessary. We need not bother signing for the language by ourselves.  [Person1]:  A slow sparrow should make an early start. You know, I am not quick at learning any language. 
[Person1]:  What do you want to do this weekend? [Person2]:  Oh, I don't know. Maybe go to the beach if it's nice weather. [Person1]:  But we did that last weekend. Let's do something different. [Person2]:  Hum... Hey, I know what! Why don't we climb Mt. Fuji? [Person1]:  Great idea! I've always wanted to do that! [Person2]:  Paul and Mary talked about a bicycle ride yesterday, but they haven't made the final decision. Maybe we could persuade them to join us. [Person1]:  Wonderful! I give them a call right now.
[Person1]:  Where do we want to go sightseeing today? [Person2]:  I want to visit this temple I've read about in the guidebook. [Person1]:  OK. I will buy the entrance ticket. [Person2]:  Oh, I didn't realize we have to pay to get in. [Person1]:  In China, there is a small fee to enter museums, parks and temples. [Person2]:  That's very different from back home. Well, this is my first visit to China and I've heard this temple is amazing. When was it built? [Person1]:  Pretty recently. About 150 years ago. [Person2]:  Well, that seems very old to me. [Person1]:  Considering China's 5000 year old history, it's relatively new. [Person2]:  Have you been to the temple? [Person1]:  No, but my parents have. I think we should find a taxi and go.
[Person1]:  I'd appreciate it if you could help me pick out a gift for my daughter.  [Person2]:  Would she be interested in a laptop?  [Person1]:  That's exactly what I was thinking of.  [Person2]:  A Mac would be an excellent gift.  [Person1]:  I like Macs. How much for a Mac?  [Person2]:  You can take a 15-inch Pro home right now for only $2, 100.  [Person1]:  A Mac it is. I'll take one home with me.  [Person2]:  She'll be very happy with this. And how do you plan to pay for it?  [Person1]:  I'll use my VISA, if that's okay.  [Person2]:  Now, if you'll just sign here, the Mac is all yours.  [Person1]:  Will she need anything besides what's in this box?  [Person2]:  Everything she needs is right here in the box.  [Person1]:  I appreciate your help. Maybe I'll be back for more computer stuff.  [Person2]:  Your daughter should get straight A's from now on. Good-bye. 
[Person1]:  Good morning. May I help you? [Person2]:  Yes. I'm looking for an apartment, I'd like two bedrooms. [Person1]:  All right. Have a seat, please. Let me ask you a few questions. First of all, may I have your name, please? [Person2]:  My name's Donald Eakins. [Person1]:  How do you spell your last name, Mr.Eakins. [Person2]:  It's E-A-K-I-N-S. [Person1]:  E-A-K-I-N-S.First name, Donald. And what's your present address, Mr.Eakins? [Person2]:  It's 1446 Pine Street. [Person1]:  1446 Pine. That's in San Francisco, isn't it? [Person2]:  Yes, it is.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, I'm looking for a good novel. Can you recommend anything? [Person2]:  Certainly. What kind of novel did you have in mind? [Person1]:  I'm not really sure. I don't like romance novels, but any other genre is okay, as long as the book's good. [Person2]:  Well, let me see. . . This Stephen King novel is a real thriller. [Person1]:  Sorry, I forgot to mention that I don't like horror much, either. [Person2]:  That's okay. Well, let me think. How about a mystery novel? [Person1]:  Hmm. . . I sometimes like mysteries, but I don't think I'm in the mood for one right now. [Person2]:  There are a number of science fiction and fantasy novels I can recommend. [Person1]:  I love science fiction and fantasy, but I've been reading a lot of both lately, so I'd prefer to get something else. [Person2]:  How about a good historical novel? This one set in medieval France is excellent. The story is exciting and the characterization is very well done. [Person1]:  That sounds interesting. Okay, I'll get this one. Thanks for all your help. [Person2]:  Don't mention it.
[Person1]:  So what kind of job did you find for this summer? [Person2]:  I'm working for a marketing company. I'm doing telephone marketing. [Person1]:  Oh, so you are one of those people who drive me crazy by calling me up in trying to persuade me to buy something that I have no need for. Do you like it? [Person2]:  Believe it or not, I do. There are a lot of students working there and we have a lot of fun when we're not making calls. It's really easy since we just have to read from a text. [Person1]:  Are you doing this full time? [Person2]:  Yeah, but I work from 2
[Person1]:  I was wondering if this is where the Resume Writing Workshop is being held. [Person2]:  You are in the right place. Please come on in! [Person1]:  It's been a long time since I've had to look for work and put a resume together. [Person2]:  It's going to come together just fine. Trust me! [Person1]:  Where do we begin? [Person2]:  We start at the top with our name and contact information. Make sure the information is current. [Person1]:  Then what do we do? [Person2]:  Put your job experience first, if that is more impressive than your education. [Person1]:  What about listing my interests and affiliations next? [Person2]:  Yes, that would make a good ending for your resume.
[Person1]:  Oh great! This stupid computer froze again! That's the third time today! Hey Samuel, can you come take a look at my PC? It's acting again. It must have a virus or something. [Person2]:  Just give me a second. I'll be right up. I ran a virus scan on your computer, and it turns out that you have a lot of infected files! [Person1]:  But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing the internet, I have no idea how I could have picked up a virus. [Person2]:  Well, you have to make sure that your anti-virus software is updated regularly, yours wasn't up to date, that's probably what was causing your problems. [Person1]:  Ok. Anything else? [Person2]:  Yeah, try not to kick or hit the computer! [Person1]:  Um yeah. Sorry about that.
[Person1]:  Excuse me. Do you know where I can find the nearest ICCC? [Person2]:  Yes, but it's quite a ways. [Person1]:  Do I need to take a bus? [Person2]:  This bus doesn't take you directly there. You'd have to change buses twice. I suggest you walk. It'll take you less than 20 minutes. [Person1]:  How do I get there on foot? [Person2]:  Go straight ahead through the intersection. [Person1]:  Wait, let me write this down. . . Alright, I'm ready. [Person2]:  Keep walking till you pass the square, then turn right. Walk past two lights and turn left at the third. [Person1]:  Square. . . turn right. . . traffic lights. . . And then? [Person2]:  Keep walking and look for a tall building. [Person1]:  Tall building. . . Which side is the building on? [Person2]:  The right side. ICCC should be on the first floor. [Person1]:  Thank you very much. [Person2]:  You're welcome.
[Person1]:  Where do you wish me to take you, sir? [Person2]:  Please take us to Harvard University. By the way, is it far from here? [Person1]:  It takes about half an hour to get there. [Person2]:  OK. [Person1]:  Here we are, sir. [Person2]:  How much do I owe you? [Person1]:  It's 35 dollars on the meter. [Person2]:  Here's 50 dollars. Keep the change. [Person1]:  Thank you. Have a nice day.
[Person1]:  So will you come to work with us? [Person2]:  Can I use my green pad again to write you admiring notes? [Person1]:  We'll have to negotiate that. It's a possibility.

[Person1]:  What is your great struck? [Person2]:  I think I'm very good at planning. I manage my time perfectly, so that I can always get things done on time. [Person1]:  Why do you think you be a good fit or this job? [Person2]:  Because I'm very competent in this area. [Person1]:  Are you working under pressure? [Person2]:  Yes, I work well under pressure and find it dimly. However, I believe planning and probable management of my time can reduce tight deadlines. [Person1]:  Are you more a follower or a leader? [Person2]:  I don't try to go ahead of people and lead them, I'd rather cooperate with everybody else and get the job done by working together.
[Person1]:  Hello, Mr. Lawson. It's a pleasure to see you again. You seem to be in here all the time at the moment! What can I do for you today? [Person2]:  I've prepared some L / C documents, all in accordance with the conditions. There shouldn't be any problems; I've done about a million of these things recently.

You must really enjoy it. [Person2]:  Oh, I do. Yeah, it's interesting, but it's quite tiring. But, What about you, Mike? [Person1]:  I work in a law firm, practicing in business law. [Person2]:  Oh, that's challenging. [Person1]:  Yeah, but I like my job.
[Person1]:  It seldom rains this summer.  [Person2]:  Yeah, some places are very short of water.  [Person1]:  Because of pollution and other things, our environment has become worse and worse.  [Person2]:  You see, This time I traveled to the West. When I looked out of the windows of the rain, all the lands that I could see are as dry as a bone.  [Person1]:  It is serious. 
[Person1]:  Hi, Angela, what's up? [Person2]:  We are planning to visit Zhang Jiakou this February. Why don't you join us? [Person1]:  Certainly, I will if I don't have anything else on my schedule.

[Person2]:  We want to visit some ski resorts in other places of interests there, you know, Zhang Jiakou is one of the whole cities for the two thousand twenty two Winter Olympic Games.

[Person1]:  The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend. [Person2]:  So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach? [Person1]:  It sounds like it will be. [Person2]:  I really hope it doesn't get cold. [Person1]:  That would ruin things, I want to go so badly. [Person2]:  The weather in California is unpredictable, so you never know. [Person1]:  That is true. The weather is constantly changing. [Person2]:  It would be nice if the weather would never change. [Person1]:  That would be great, then we could plan things sooner. [Person2]:  True. Predictable weather would make life easier.
[Person1]:  I went to the tutoring service centre on campus today. And I got a job. [Person2]:  Congratulation. What will you do? [Person1]:  They got me a part-time tutoring job, teaching an Australian businessman Chinese. [Person2]:  That's wonderful. I want to get a part-time job too. Tell me what I should do. [Person1]:  It's very simple actually. You can go to the service centre and have your name and job interest resisted. They will give you a call if any job comes up. [Person2]:  Good. I'll do it.
[Person1]:  The bartender just gave the last call. Let's order another round, okay? [Person2]:  Sure, but let's get a pitcher this time We should be able to down it before they close.

I think I can find it. [Person2]:  You're back already. That sure was quick. [Person1]:  That's because I just took one step inside and turned right around. That bathroom is too gross for me. [Person2]:  Well, the bartender wouldn't give me the pitcher of beer. Anyway. He said it was too close to closing time. [Person1]:  Let's leave then. I could take some fresh air, anyway. [Person2]:  Okay, let's go!

[Person1]:  Hey Steven! You have a large chunk of money, but why do you still live in the old flat, instead of buying a new villa? [Person2]:  I like to live here and enjoy my neighbors'company. And I don't think I should waste money just because I have much of it. [Person1]:  But I found you always hate to part with your money. Look at the car you drive! You must have droven it for at least twenty years! It's such a junker! [Person2]:  Oh, the car is old but still in good condition. I just think we should be thrifty, whether you are rich or not. [Person1]:  But. . . But. . . [Person2]:  But what? Just remember that thrift is not only a great virtue, but also a great revenue. [Person1]:  I am sorry. Maybe you are right.
[Person1]:  Yeah. You don't need to rub it in. [Person2]:  And then she made the deal with MicroPower. Vince wanted to sell for fifteen million. . . [Person1]:  Fifteen? And Zina pushed them up to seventy-five? [Person2]:  That's right. Vince still stops by her office every day to thank her. [Person1]:  Anyway, I'm still happy I left. I'm working as a freelancer now. [Person2]:  You really should have stayed with us, Dave.
[Person1]:  Can you tell me about some good deals on produce? [Person2]:  The mangoes are on sale today. [Person1]:  What exactly are mangoes? [Person2]:  They have yellowish red skin. It's a fruit with one big seed. [Person1]:  Is the seed edible? [Person2]:  Maybe if you were a parrot. I wouldn't recommend it. [Person1]:  How much does a mango cost? [Person2]:  Normally, they're $ 2 each. Today, they're only $ 1 each. [Person1]:  Maybe I won't like the taste. [Person2]:  It's hard to describe. They're sweet, but also sort of citrusy. [Person1]:  How do I tell the difference between a ripe one and an unripe one? [Person2]:  They're similar to an avocado. When the outside feels soft, they're ripe. [Person1]:  Where do most of them come from? [Person2]:  These are from Mexico.
[Person1]:  Hi, Ann. I hear you've started evening discussions on popular music. How is it going? [Person2]:  Pretty well. I must say I've learned a lot. But it would be nicer to have someone who knows more about the subject. Could you possibly join us? [Person1]:  Certainly. When do you usually meet? [Person2]:  We meet twice a week-Tuesday and Saturday. Is the time convenient for you? [Person1]:  Tuesday is OK. But I don't think I can come on Saturday. [Person2]:  What about Friday evenings? We hope to see you present. [Person1]:  OK. I'm free on Friday evenings.
[Person1]:  Kathy, it seems you're having a lot of fun playing tennis. [Person2]:  Would you like to learn? [Person1]:  Yes, how do you play? [Person2]:  Tennis can be played in singles or doubles. Look, there, the outside lines are for doubles and the inside lines are for singles. [Person1]:  How do you decide who start serving? [Person2]:  Well, you can use a coin to decide. Whoever wins chooses either to serve or the side of the court. [Person1]:  How do you count the score? [Person2]:  At the beginning, the score would be love. [Person1]:  Love means 0? [Person2]:  You got it, it is then counted to 15, 30 and 40. If you get to 40 and win again, you win the game. [Person1]:  The other side start serving then? [Person2]:  Right, see? You know how to play now.

I was practicing volleyball. [Person2]:  Oh, you did, did you?

We should be ready to start the construction work in week 23. [Person1]:  How long will the sub contractors be on site? [Person2]:  About ten weeks in total if everything goes according to plan. [Person1]:  I'm sure it will. So, we should be able to start moving the machinery in during week 34. I'll confirm that date with our suppliers.

[Person2]:  I will, do you want me to bring anything? [Person1]:  No, just bring yourself. I hope to see you there.
[Person1]:  This small town has many serious problems. [Person2]:  What's the cause? [Person1]:  The mayor and high officials practice cronyism and a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions. [Person2]:  I see why it lags behind other towns.
[Person1]:  Hello there! Come on in! Don't just stand there! Come and take a seat! [Person2]:  Um, okay. Well, I just want a trim. Nothing too fancy. [Person1]:  Oh my gosh! Your hair is amazing! So silky, so shiny! I am going to work my magic on your hair! You hear me? You are going to look like a million bucks! [Person2]:  Okay. Um. . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top. [Person1]:  Don't you worry, I'll take care of everything! ( starts cutting ) Oh my god! I just love your curly hair! It's so fluffy and cute! You should totally let it grow out. An afro would look great on you! [Person2]:  Um. . . no. [Person1]:  Okay, but you are going to be my masterpiece!
[Person1]:  This apartment is great, but could I upgrade a few things? [Person2]:  What are you unhappy with? [Person1]:  I want to have a different color carpet. [Person2]:  If you agree to pay more money, you could upgrade the carpet. [Person1]:  Would it cost a lot more? [Person2]:  It could be as little as 2 dollars or as much as 10 dollars more per square yard. [Person1]:  I was also wondering if it would be possible to pick a different paint color. [Person2]:  Bring me a paint sample to look at, and I will consider it. [Person1]:  When can you finish with the new carpet and paint? [Person2]:  Your new apartment can be recarpeted and repainted by next Tuesday.
[Person1]:  How are you going all these days? [Person2]:  Fine, thanks. [Person1]:  But you look depressed. [Person2]:  I have some problem with my work. [Person1]:  Is it serious? [Person2]:  I can solve it, thanks. [Person1]:  How about your family? [Person2]:  Everything is Okay. And as soon as I see my son at home, all my worries vanish into the blue.
[Person1]:  What a beautiful sweater! [Person2]:  Do you think it looks good on me? [Person1]:  Yes, and it goes beautifully with your pants. [Person2]:  You won't believe it, but it was really cheap. [Person1]:  I wish I could find one just like it.

[Person1]:  Currencies? As in Euros, Dollars, Pounds and Rupees? [Person2]:  It's called Forex. Foreign Exchange. The great thing about it is that I don't have to invest a huge amount. I put in a margin deposit and then I can buy and sell up to 100 times that much! [Person1]:  I don't understand. You're buying and selling money? [Person2]:  You got it! Just last night I made USD 150! [Person1]:  Last night? [Person2]:  Yeah! It's a 24 hour market! I had bought some RMB earlier at a low asking price but last night it appreciated drastically so I made a split second decision and sold all my RMB at an amazing bid! I' [Person1]:  You're kidding! I'm on! Where do I sign up?
[Person1]:  I think I'm going to go get some food. [Person2]:  What do you want? [Person1]:  I can't decide what to get. [Person2]:  What kind of food do you want to get? [Person1]:  I think I might like some Chinese food. [Person2]:  Do you know where you're going to get it? [Person1]:  I honestly don't know. [Person2]:  I go to Panda Express for my Chinese food.

[Person1]:  How is the weather today? [Person2]:  It's very hot and humid. [Person1]:  Quite different from the forecast. [Person2]:  The weather changes often at this time of the year. It's possible to cool down in the late afternoon. [Person1]:  How are the summers here generally? [Person2]:  They are usually hot and rainy. [Person1]:  I have been here for about a month. It's very hot and humid. [Person2]:  It's just June now. The rainy season hasn't arrived yet. [Person1]:  What shall we do today? Good weekends shouldn't be wasted. [Person2]:  What about swimming? [Person1]:  That's a great idea.
[Person1]:  I don't think the teacher had a right to say that. The teacher was wrong to have accused her in front of the whole class. [Person2]:  You've got to be joking! It's the teacher's right to say anything wants, and if she saw Myra cheating, she certainly had the right to say so. [Person1]:  I agree she had the right to say something, but I feel she should have done it privately. [Person2]:  You're right. If I were the teacher, I wouldn't have done that. [Person1]:  The bell rings. Let's get in the class.

[Person2]:  You can see it tomorrow.  [Person1]:  I don't want to miss it today.  [Person2]:  See you.  [Person1]:  See you. 
[Person1]:  Hey Michelle, jump in quick. It's pouring out there!  [Person2]:  Oh, hi Melissa. Are you going to the conference too? I was planning to pick up Mr. Campbell.  [Person1]:  Yes, he told me. We need to pick him up at his hotel and then go to the conference.  [Person2]:  Oh I see, okay. So I heard you got married. Congratulations!  [Person1]:  Ah thank you! I'm very excited. We were going to get married next year, but then we decided to get married on holiday instead. It was wonderful.  [Person2]:  That sounds so romantic! Jack and I were hoping to get married in Europe next year, but we had to postpone our plans. We just don't have the money!  [Person1]:  I know what you mean. I think Shanghai is getting more and more expensive, don't you?  [Person2]:  I sure do. In my opinion, it's actually becoming more expensive than back home.  [Person1]:  Definitely. Oh, there's Mr. Campbell. Driver, can you stop here please? 
[Person1]:  So, Marcia, what did you think? [Person2]:  Well, between Sarah Tims and Daniel Watson, I think the choice is pretty obvious. [Person1]:  So do I. Daniel looked so good on paper. His resume was a little too perfect. [Person2]:  He seemed great when I first spoke to him. [Person1]:  Yes, but first impression often lies. I guess some people like that sort of style, but it wouldn't fit in with us. He was much too confident. [Person2]:  I couldn't agree more whereas Sarah Tims. [Person1]:  She was very convincing and confident, but also modest. And I thought her presentation was excellent. [Person2]:  Yes, it was. But I am a little worried about how much experience she has. [Person1]:  Yes, that's true. But she seems ready to take on any challenges we give her. [Person2]:  So, who do we give the job to? [Person1]:  Sarah. [Person2]:  I agree entirely.
[Person1]:  Hello, China Southern Airlines. Can I help you? [Person2]:  Yes, could I make a reservation to New York on July 21st, next Friday?

[Person1]:  Bye.
[Person1]:  I can't believe the cost of apartments in New York City. [Person2]:  Oh, you didn't know that apartments here are considered valuable, even if they are small and crowded? [Person1]:  Of course I had heard about that, but now I know how expensive it is to rent a place here. [Person2]:  I don't mind paying high rent to live in New York. [Person1]:  Why? You pay so much for such a tiny space to live. [Person2]:  Yeah, but so what! I'm proud to live in the world's most exciting city. And, the salaries here are the highest in the nation, too.
[Person1]:  Hi! Is that the new laptop you brought last week? It looks very nice. [Person2]:  Yes, it is. Thanks. I ' m just surfing on the internet. [Person1]:  Here? In this cafe? How can you do that? [Person2]:  This cafe offers a wireless internet connection. That means I can get on the net for free while I ' m here. Of course, I have to buy a cup of coffee! [Person1]:  That ' s great. Can you do it anywhere? [Person2]:  No. you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection. There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city. [Person1]:  So, what programs do you have on your laptop? [Person2]:  I ' Ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then I have a few for creating and editing photographs. [Person1]:  I know you are keen on photography. It ' s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera. Then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone, anywhere, at a [Person2]:  It ' s wonderful, isn ' t it? Would you like to see some photos that I took recently?
[Person1]:  Good morning, sir. Can I see your boarding pass, please? [Person2]:  Here you are. [Person1]:  Excuse me, sir. This is your passport. [Person2]:  Really? Ugh. . . Is there any difference? [Person1]:  Yes. As a matter of fact, you can't board the plane without boarding pass. [Person2]:  Gee. I must have left it in my hotel room. [Person1]:  I'm sorry sir. I can't let you pass. [Person2]:  But when does the plane take off? [Person1]:  Ugh, in about thirty minutes, sir. [Person2]:  Oh, my God! What do I do now? Bone head, bone head, bone head ( He smashes his head with his hand. ). [Person1]:  Calm down, sir. You are creating a commotion. [Person2]:  ( The speaker in the airport says, 'Mr. Benjamin, we now have a boarding pass by the name of Benjamin at Lost and Found. ') Is that me? [Person1]:  Could be. [Person2]:  Oh, thank God. Thank you, I'll be right back. [Person1]:  ( Benjamin starts to run and then he seems to remember something and returns. ) Ugh, excuse me, where is the Lost and Found? [Person2]:  It's down in the lobby. Turn left at exit B. [Person1]:  Thank you, thank you, thanks again.
[Person1]:  Vince. We're both busy, so I'm not going to beat around the bush. I need a raise. [Person2]:  I can't do that, Zina. You know I can't. [Person1]:  Bull. I're done my research. I know you still control more than 65 percent of invoking options. [Person2]:  Who told you that? [Person1]:  That doesn't matter. I want at least 4 percent.
[Person1]:  Wow! What happened to you? You look sad. [Person2]:  I just lost my job. My boss just told me. [Person1]:  That's unbelievable. Why did this happen? [Person2]:  I don't understand of myself. It seems they have to save money. [Person1]:  I cant't believe it. You've worked here for years.
[Person1]:  So how long do you plan to live here? [Person2]:  We'd like to sign a year-long contract, if that's OK. [Person1]:  Fine by me. Do you know how to read this kind of contract? [Person2]:  Yes. We've signed them before. We even brought our chops. [Person1]:  Great. When in Rome, you guys know what to do. [Person2]:  We'll sign our signatures, too. And give you our passport numbers along with our ARC numbers. [Person1]:  That about does it. See you in a week.
[Person1]:  Jodi, I must get a hold of Jim today, but I forgot his address and phone number. [Person2]:  Don't worry about it. I have his pager number right here. [Person1]:  Really? You'Ve helped me a lot. Thank you. [Person2]:  Forget it. It's nothing.
[Person1]:  You look upset, is there anything wrong? [Person2]:  Yes, to tell you the truth, there is. [Person1]:  What is it? [Person2]:  Well, I've lost my wallet and my ID card. [Person1]:  Oh, that's too bad! I am sorry to hear that! [Person2]:  Forget it, there is no use crying over the spilled milk.
[Person1]:  What's wrong, Jerry? You look so upset. [Person2]:  To be honest, I was just dumped. [Person1]:  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. You can go on a holiday cheer you up. [Person2]:  No, thanks. I'm not in the mood for traveling. [Person1]:  Come on. A trip will do you good. Are you doing anything this weekend? [Person2]:  I was planning on doing a lot of wallowing. [Person1]:  Well, my friends and I are planning on going to Shangri-La on Saturday. Do you want to come with us? [Person2]:  Where is that? [Person1]:  Not very far from here. We'll fly. It's about one and a half hours. [Person2]:  What's there to see? [Person1]:  There is a large canyon, vast grasslands, ancient forests and mountain lakes. [Person2]:  Oh, sounds nice. [Person1]:  Yes, the scenery there is breathtaking. I have some pictures at home. You can come over and take a look if you like [Person2]:  Ok. Then I can make up my mind.
[Person1]:  No, it hasn't. It's very dirty. [Person2]:  Someone ought to clean it today. [Person1]:  Mark should clean it. It's his turn. [Person2]:  No, he cleaned it last time. It's your turn. [Person1]:  No, it isn't. You always clean it after Mark. [Person2]:  Oh dear, is it really my turn? In that case, I'll clean tomorrow. [Person1]:  Clean it now. Only lazy people say they'll work tomorrow. [Person2]:  Then I'll clean it the day after tomorrow. [Person1]:  You are lazy. You ought to be ashamed? You should enjoy working.
[Person1]:  What a great weekend that was! [Person2]:  My feeling's exactly. [Person1]:  I really enjoy the beach in the summer. [Person2]:  I couldn't agree with you more. [Person1]:  We should come here more often. [Person2]:  You are absolutely right. [Person1]:  I'd like to come back next weekend.
[Person1]:  I like NBA very much. [Person2]:  Did you watch NBA games before you came to the U. S. ? [Person1]:  No, I didn't. [Person2]:  What a pity! [Person1]:  Do you like NBA? [Person2]:  Yes, of course. [Person1]:  Who do you like best of the NBA players? [Person2]:  Kobe. [Person1]:  So do I. [Person2]:  Let's go to watch an NBA game tonight, shall we? [Person1]:  That's fine.
[Person1]:  I need to make some money so that I can take a trip to the north in February. Do you know any ways of making money? [Person2]:  How about delivering papers? [Person1]:  I already thought of that, but I don't have a bike. [Person2]:  How about walking dogs? [Person1]:  What? Walking dogs? [Person2]:  Yeah, you know, there are lots of people around here with little dogs. The dogs have to be walked every day. That's good for their health. [Person1]:  I don't know. How much can I make? [Person2]:  More than carrying papers. [Person1]:  Well, I do like animals. How do you go about finding dogs to walk? [Person2]:  Put an advertisement in the Sunday newspaper. [Person1]:  And how much is an ad? [Person2]:  An ad is under ten dollars, I'm sure. You can try for two dollars for half an hour--that would be ten dollars for five times a week. You can walk three or four dogs every day after school, you can get rich.
[Person1]:  What seems to be the matter? [Person2]:  I just can't sleep well, doctor. [Person1]:  I see. And how long have you had this problem? [Person2]:  Oh, for about two weeks now. [Person1]:  Two weeks. Do you have headaches? [Person2]:  Sometimes. [Person1]:  Fever? [Person2]:  No. [Person1]:  Are you having any family problems? [Person2]:  No, not really. We all get along pretty well. [Person1]:  And how about work? [Person2]:  Well, I've been working a lot lately... more than 11 hours a day. [Person1]:  Maybe you should take a vacation and just rest for a few days. [Person2]:  Well, I can't right now. We're in the middle of some important business. [Person1]:  Yes, I understand, but you really need to slow down. You're going to kill yourself if you go on like this.
[Person1]:  Hey, Jessica, there is a new fun test in the paper. I love to fill these things out. [Person2]:  What's this one about? [Person1]:  It's about health. [Person2]:  OK. Read it to me. I'll keep score. [Person1]:  OK. No. 1 [Person2]:  That's easy. I gave up smoking three years ago. [Person1]:  Right. You know, I should too. [Person2]:  Yeah, I've heard that before. [Person1]:  No, No, really. I'm going to. But for now I'd have to say, yes. OK. No. 2 [Person2]:  Yeah, the company makes us go to the doctor every year. How about you? [Person1]:  Well, I went to the doctor...let's see...about three years ago. [Person2]:  You should go more often. [Person1]:  Well, let's move on to No. 7 [Person2]:  No, but you've been working a lot lately. [Person1]:  I'm really tired. I should work a lot less. But we've been busy though. [Person2]:  You really should slow down. [Person1]:  It's not that easy. Last question [Person2]:  Worry a lot? Yeah. I guess I'd have to say yes. I should rest more. [Person1]:  I definitely should rest more. You know what? It's surprising I'm not dead already.
[Person1]:  Hi, Kate. [Person2]:  Hi, Don. What a surprise! [Person1]:  Yeah, I saw someone walking like you, but I wasn't sure. We haven't seen each other for how long? Almost three months? But you look quite different now. [Person2]:  Have you noticed what has changed? [Person1]:  Oh, you look quite slender and more vivacious. What have you been taking? Are you on a diet? [Person2]:  Yes. I'm on a diet, but I'Ve not taken anything. I just eat less and exercise more. And it really worked in the past three months. I'Ve lost twelve pounds. [Person1]:  Wow! That's great. I sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals, but it's difficult for me to keep up the exercise. Also you know, old habits are hard to break. [Person2]:  What kind of exercise do you think I do? I just go to dance everyday after work. I'm taking an amateur dance class. I dance two hours everyday. [Person1]:  Dance? You only go dancing? That's not hard. I can do that. [Person2]:  Sure. Join my class next week.
[Person1]:  Tell me about yourself and your past experience.  [Person2]:  For the past 3 years, I have been working in China East Airlines Corporation Limited. I'm very tolerant of people and have been told that this is one of my strengths. I feel I have a lot to offer as a team member.  [Person1]:  Why are you interested in this occupation?  [Person2]:  It's always been my dream to be a stewardess. And I like travelling to different places.  [Person1]:  What do you think is the chief charcteristic for a stewardess?  [Person2]:  Well, a stewardess should be friendly, courteous, patient and treat passengers kindly and politely.  [Person1]:  Do you get angry easily?  [Person2]:  No, I know how to control my temper.  [Person1]:  If a passenger had a accident, what would you do?  [Person2]:  I would give him or her basic first aid and ask my partner to call for assistance at the same time.  [Person1]:  If you are hired, when can you start work?  [Person2]:  I can begin to work right away because I am out of work now.  [Person1]:  What are your salary expectations?  [Person2]:  I really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary. I'd like to postpone that discussion until later. Maybe you could tell me what is budgeted for the position and how your commission structure works. 
[Person1]:  What time is our connecting flight?  [Person2]:  Let me check. Oh, oh!It's at 3 [Person1]:  Wow, that's cutting it close! That means we only have 25 minutes to make the connection! What gate is it at?  [Person2]:  It's at... gate 14.  [Person1]:  Oh, great! That's at the other end of the terminal!  [Person2]:  OK, so here's the plan; When we land, run to gate 14!  [Person1]:  I'm be right behind ya! 
[Person1]:  Happy birthday, Ms. Lin. Here is a present for you.  [Person2]:  Oh, thank you! It's very kind of you. Ah, it is a porcelain vase.  [Person1]:  I hope you like it.  [Person2]:  Yes, it is lovely. I have been expecting something like this for a long time. Thanks ever so much.  [Person1]:  I am glad you like it. 
[Person1]:  Linda, John and I are going to get married next week.  [Person2]:  That's wonderful. Congratulations.  [Person1]:  Thank you, Linda. We would love you to come to our wedding.

[Person1]:  Hi, I'd like to get my haircut. [Person2]:  Well, can we interest you in today's special? We'll shampoo cut and style your hair for one unbelievable low price of $12.00. [Person1]:  OK, but I just want to get my haircut a little bit. A little off the top and sides. That's all. [Person2]:  No problem. OK, here we go. So what do you do for a living? [Person1]:  I'm a lawyer and I'm in town for a job interview and... [Person2]:  Oops! [Person1]:  What do you mean'oops'? Hey, can I see a mirror? [Person2]:  Nothing to worry about, sir. Relax! [Person1]:  Ouch! That really hurt. What are you doing, anyway? Oh, look at all my hair on the floor. How much are you really cutting off? [Person2]:  Relax. Time for the shampoo. [Person1]:  Hey, you got shampoo in my eyes. Where's the towel? Oh, gosh, you cut my hair too short. I want to talk to the manager now. [Person2]:  I'm sorry, but he's on vacation. [Person1]:  Uh.
[Person1]:  Is April Fools Day on Friday or Saturday this year? [Person2]:  I'm almost certain it's on Thursday. [Person1]:  My god, I thought it was on the weekend. I was going to play a joke on my girlfriend and then invite her to a restaurant. [Person2]:  Why can't you invite her out on Thursday? [Person1]:  Because I have an exam on Friday. [Person2]:  Well, you could invite her out on the weekend to celebrate this interesting an late April Fools Day. [Person1]:  I guess I'll have to do that.
[Person1]:  hey, you look great! how's everything? [Person2]:  yeah, you know what? I've been going to the club regularly. The training really pays off. Now I am in a good shape and I know more about how to keep fit. [Person1]:  really? tell me about it. I haven't gone to the club for a long time. I am too busy with work. [Person2]:  it's important to do proper exercises. [Person1]:  you're right. Too much or too little won't do any good. [Person2]:  the trainer tells me, besides regular sports activities, I should also have a healthy and balanced diet. [Person1]:  sounds reasonable. [Person2]:  we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic. [Person1]:  and fruits! [Person2]:  surely it is. Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness. [Person1]:  I've heard that. Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit? [Person2]:  yeah, he advises me to stay in a good mood. That can help one to keep sound physical health. [Person1]:  I think if you follow your trainer's advice, you'll be on the right track. [Person2]:  you bet it!
[Person1]:  I am sure we will make it up as soon as possible. [Person2]:  That's nice. [Person1]:  We hope this matter will not affect our good relations in our future dealings. [Person2]:  Of course not. We have cooperated for a long time.
[Person1]:  Hey, Wen! Welcome to D. C. ! Glad you came out to visit! [Person2]:  Thanks for inviting me. Actually, I've never been anywhere with so many black people before. It's different. [Person1]:  Howard is eighty percent black. But there are whites, and even Asians here. Thankfully, it's also coed. [Person2]:  Great! Is your, too? [Person1]:  Sorry, nope. But the Alpha Phi Alpha's are throwing a party tonight. [Person2]:  That's a black fraternity, right? So we should see some dancing!
[Person1]:  Excuse me, I would like to know something about this campus. Right now it seems very big and confusing! I have no idea where I am going or what I am doing. [Person2]:  Do you have a map of the campus? [Person1]:  Yes, I have, but it doesn ' t help me very much. I ' m not very good at reading maps. [Person2]:  Do you know where your classes are? [Person1]:  More or less. I go to three different buildings, and always get there late. I feel so hopeless. I don ' t know why I am late all the time. No one else seems to be. [Person2]:  That's because you don't know the short cuts. You'll learn them after a while. I can show you the ropes.
[Person1]:  Tom, is Jenny crying? [Person2]:  Can you take he away from me? [Person1]:  I ' m just coming for that. [Person2]:  She kept bothering me. [Person1]:  She ' s your sister. What she asked was only duck soup for you. Why can ' t you be good to her? [Person2]:  But I am her brother, not her servant.
[Person1]:  Didn't you punch in this morning, Monica? [Person2]:  Sorry, I don't know the rule about punching. [Person1]:  That's ok. I should have told you earlier. This is a company rule. [Person2]:  Do we also need to punch out after work? [Person1]:  According to the company rule, we should punch in before 8 o'clock and punch out after 5 o'clock every work day. [Person2]:  How about the lunch break, Lucy? [Person1]:  From eleven thirty to 1 o'clock. [Person2]:  May I ask whether we need to work overtime? [Person1]:  Sometimes, but not quite often.
[Person1]:  Have you decided what you are going to take next semester? [Person2]:  Well, I'm an English major, you know. So I came here to make sure I'm taking the right things. [Person1]:  Good. I think it's a good idea. Our department should require meetings like this. [Person2]:  I want to finish my degree in four years. So I don't want to forget to take classes I need. I have a friend who has to stay in college another year. She didn't know until recently. There were some classes she needed to take to graduate. She didn't know about them. [Person1]:  Yes, that happens. [Person2]:  I brought my transcript from my first year. Here. And here is the list of courses I plan to take in the fall. [Person1]:  Alright. Good. I see you've already taken six credits of your breadth requirements. You have one botany class and one chemistry class. And political science. So that's nine credits. Did you take English Composition 201? [Person2]:  No, I don't need to. I took Advanced Placement English in high school. So I'm not required to take composition. [Person1]:  Excellent. I see you have the 18th century poetry class for next semester. And the modern novel class. You haven't taken a Shakespeare class yet. [Person2]:  No, I thought I would take it later. [Person1]:  Actually, I recommend you take Shakespeare sooner rather than later. [Person2]:  Well, I suppose I could cross out the 18th century poetry class. I have to see when the Shakespeare class meets. [Person1]:  Let me look at the timetable. Shakespeare meets Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 11 [Person2]:  I can take it then. I have that time slot free. [Person1]:  Good. I recommend it. Shakespeare is of course enormously important. We want our students to take the class as soon as they can. And Professor Friedman is an excellent teacher. [Person2]:  I'll take it then. [Person1]:  Tell me, Lisa, what made you decide to be an English major? [Person2]:  I want to be an English professor in the future. I love studying literature, and I want to teach it. [Person1]:  Really? That's great to know. [Person2]:  That's the reason I want to finish my B. A. in four years. Because I know I will be in school a long time. I want to start the M. A. and Ph. D. program as soon as possible.
[Person1]:  wow, it that your sports car? [Person2]:  yes, do you like it? [Person1]:  I love it! I used to always want to drive a green jaguar. Is it in good condition? [Person2]:  it looks good on the outside, but the inside is a different story. It needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again. [Person1]:  what's wrong with it? [Person2]:  well, first of all, it needs a new engine, which is extremely expensive. [Person1]:  when's the last time you had it serviced? [Person2]:  it must have been a few years ago now. [Person1]:  I thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis. [Person2]:  they do. Once my son was born, there was no reason to drive this car anymore. It's only a two-seater, you know! [Person1]:  what else is wrong with it? [Person2]:  the heating controls don't work anymore, so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car, even in the summer! [Person1]:  anything else? [Person2]:  the brakes don't really work that well anymore either. [Person1]:  why don't you get it all fixed? [Person2]:  it costs more than you think to run a car, especially when there are so many things wrong with it! [Person1]:  well, let me know when you can get it fixed. I'd love to go for a ride in it!
[Person1]:  Would you like to come to our party? [Person2]:  I'd like to. But I'm not myself today. [Person1]:  what happened? You look so pale. [Person2]:  It's the end of the world for me. [Person1]:  What makes you say that? [Person2]:  Today, I'm told I failed three courses. [Person1]:  Oh, that's too bad. Work harder next term. [Person2]:  I'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste of time to me. [Person1]:  Don't lose heart. Everything will be fine. [Person2]:  I hope so.
[Person1]:  Hello, this is Wal-mart. Can I help you? [Person2]:  Hello. What time do you close, please? [Person1]:  We close at 10 [Person2]:  Oh. Ok. And are you open on the weekends? [Person1]:  Same hours as on the weekdays. [Person2]:  Wow. You guys never take a break! I want to come in and have a look at your sale. Your sale is still on, isn't it? [Person1]:  Yes, it runs till the end of the month. But things are clearing out fast. [Person2]:  Ok, I'll come down tonight. Thanks. [Person1]:  Thank you for calling.
[Person1]:  May I help you? [Person2]:  My daughter. She is missing. I don't know where she is. [Person1]:  What dose she look like? [Person2]:  She has blond hair and blue eyes. [Person1]:  What was she wearing? [Person2]:  She has a yellow dress on and red sneakers. [Person1]:  When did you last see her? [Person2]:  I just saw her down the street. I don't know where she is. [Person1]:  How long has it been? [Person2]:  Oh, it's been uh. . . fifteen minutes.
[Person1]:  Hi, Becky, what's up? [Person2]:  Not much, except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall. [Person1]:  What's the problem? [Person2]:  She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do. I can never do anything right when she's around. [Person1]:  For example? [Person2]:  Well, last week I invited her over to dinner. My husband and I had no problem with the food, but if you listened to her, then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables. There's just nothing can please her. [Person1]:  No, I can't see that happening. I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen. [Person2]:  It's not just that. She also criticizes how we raise the kids. [Person1]:  My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us. If it wasn't disciplining them enough, then we were disciplining them too much. She also complained about the food we fed them, the schools we sent them too, and everything else under the sun. [Person2]:  You said she used to? How did you stop her? [Person1]:  We basically sat her down and told her how we felt about her constant criticizing, and how we welcomed her advice but hoped she'd let us do our things. She understood, and now everything is a lot more peaceful. [Person2]:  That sounds like a good idea. I'll have to try that.
[Person1]:  Wait, Ben, did you say you had a party on Saturday? [Person2]:  Yeah, didn't you know about it? It was my birthday. [Person1]:  No, I didn't. [Person2]:  But I invited you. I sent you an e-mail last week. [Person1]:  Are you sure? I didn't get it. Oh, you know what? I didn't tell you I have a new e-mail address. Oh, I am sorry. [Person2]:  That's OK. But I was kind of upset that you wasn't there. [Person1]:  Really? I was upset too. And the bike trip is just awful. We got lost for four hours. [Person2]:  Oh, that's terrible. [Person1]:  Listen, let's go out for lunch this week. I want to do something for your birthday. [Person2]:  Oh, you don't have to. [Person1]:  I know. But I want to. [Person2]:  OK. That's really nice of you, really. So anyway, I have to go now. I have a meeting at 9 [Person1]:  OK. See you later and happy birthday.
[Person1]:  Hello, Milton Hotel Reservations. How may I assist you? [Person2]:  Hi, I'm calling to make some changes to an existing reservation. [Person1]:  Certainly. Do you have the reservation number? [Person2]:  Sure, it's 219. [Person1]:  That's a reservation for Sally Menkel. Is that right? [Person2]:  Yes, that's right. I'd like to change the check-in date from September 15 to September 16. [Person1]:  Certainly. I can make that change for you. Is that the only change? [Person2]:  No, the check-out date will also change from the 23rd to the 24th. [Person1]:  No problem. We have you arriving on the 16th of September and leaving the 24th of September - altogether, eight nights. Will there be anything else? [Person2]:  Yes. Instead of a courtyard room, I'd like a room with a view, preferably on an upper floor. [Person1]:  I can certainly change that for you, but there will be a change in the room rate. The new rate is $199 per night, instead of the original $179. [Person2]:  That's OK. These are all the changes. Thank you very much. [Person1]:  You're welcome. Have a nice day!
[Person1]:  Do you collect cola cans, Steve? [Person2]:  No. Why do you ask? [Person1]:  You have so many empty cans here. [Person2]:  Well, my mum wants me to keep all the cans, so that we can sell them after a while. [Person1]:  Aha, you are going to make a millionaire of yourself sooner or later with all those cans. [Person2]:  You bet I will. Well, that's not the point. The point is we separate reusable things from other rubbish. We have to pay the dustman for dealing with rubbish, but if we sell him these cans and other reusable material we pay less. [Person1]:  That sounds a clever idea. Now what are reused in China? [Person2]:  Metal, plastic, paper, books and the like. [Person1]:  Just as we do back home in the States. [Person2]:  And to avoid waste, the government is limiting the production of goods that can be used only once, such as bamboo chopsticks. For example, all the fast food boxes should be made of paper instead of non-reusable material. [Person1]:  That will surely be helpful for a clean environment.
[Person1]:  You won't believe who's been elected to do overtime on the Baker account! Me! I've already logged in 20 hours of overtime!  [Person2]:  Wow! Why so much? I thought they were getting you an assistant.  [Person1]:  They were supposed to, but so far nobody's turned up, and I'm left on my own to do the work. This is the first break I've had all day.  [Person2]:  They're really running you into the ground. Why don't you ask for some time off? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere. 
[Person1]:  Good morning and welcome. How can I help you? [Person2]:  Could you tell me something about safety deposit box rental, please? I need somewhere safe to keep some insurance documents ; I just simply don't feel comfortable keeping them at home or in the office. [Person1]:  We have 3 different types of boxes. We usually rent for 1 year and the fee depends on the size and location of the box. [Person2]:  I think I'll go for the smallest, as it's just for documents. Will I be the only key holder? I'd perhaps feel a little nervous if I knew someone else could have access to it at any time. [Person1]:  You can have more than 1 key if you'd like, but we must have signature cards for each box. [Person2]:  That's great ; I can give an extra key to my wife. I feel perfectly comfortable with her having a key. Thanks for your help. [Person1]:  If you have your ID and are willing to pay a year in advance, we can do that for you today, there is no need to wait. [Person2]:  OK, I'll take a small, for 1 year, in this branch, please.
[Person1]:  Jeff, what's your favorite Mexican holiday? [Person2]:  Definitely the Day of the Dead. [Person1]:  What is that? It sounds a little scary. [Person2]:  It's not really scary for us Mexicans. Actually, that day we celebrate, well, not celebrate, but remember our family members who are already dead. [Person1]:  OK. How do you remember them? [Person2]:  We put a big table decorated with flowers, bread, coffee or whatever the person that is dead used to like. And we think that on that day, that person is going to come back from the dead. [Person1]:  I see. And when do you have the holiday? [Person2]:  It's on November the first, and the second, too. [Person1]:  Do you do it just for your family or do you go and visit friends or other relatives? [Person2]:  No, we only keep it within the family actually.
[Person1]:  Well, that's great that you have happy experiences of teaching in Indonesia and following up on what you just mentioned. What would you recommend for students who do not live in an English speaking country? I don't know about perfecting but they want at least to be able to communicate decently. How can they go about this? [Person2]:  Yeah, it is really hard that is the real struggle because right now I do live in Holland. But I really don't socialize much with Dutch People and my boyfriend's English is so good that we just basically speak English all the time. So I have to make a real effort to practice. There isn't as much listening exposure as I want, all I have to do is turn on the TV. [Person1]:  And reading also right? [Person2]:  Yeah, reading. There was plenty I can get to read and listen to. God for a speaking there really is no substitute for trying to speak and use the language in a relaxed atmosphere. o I think that is really the challenge for People who live in a country where their target language isn't spoken and for that. Gosh, what would I do. If I didn't have People here, probably try to find a club in Sweden. They have a really cool system called study circles where it's not it's like a course but really you just have a course leader who is there sort of. As a coaching guide and to help out and you don't get grades and you go just because you want to learn.
[Person1]:  We are looking for a bilingual secretary. Do you think you are proficient in both written and spoken English? [Person2]:  I think my English is fairly good. As you can see from my CV, I graduated from university with a B. A. degree in English. I studied the English language and English literature systematically. [Person1]:  How are your typing and shorthand skills? [Person2]:  I can type 80 words a minute, basically no mistake, and can take dictation in English at 120 words per minute.
[Person1]:  I ' m glad you could find time to meet with me, Mr. Johnson. I can ' t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today, the ambiance here is lovely! [Person2]:  No problem, if possible I always combine business with pleasure. Now, let ' s hear more about these chocolates you ' re offering. [Person1]:  Well, as you know, I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States. They ' re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market. Naturally, your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately. I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant, luxurious, first class dining. [Person2]:  Mmmm, sounds interesting... gourmet chocolates, where are they produced? Belgium? [Person1]:  Actually, the factory is located in Scotland. [Person2]:  Really? I didn ' t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production [Person1]:  That ' s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units. They ' Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well. Here, I brought these especially for you, try one! [Person2]:  Oh, thanks. Mmm, hmm, creamy texture, very smooth... [Person1]:  Unique, aren ' t they? I bet you ' Ve never tasted anything like it! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one ' s cutting corners with the ingredients. Only the creme make it through inspection. [Person2]:  Yes, very interesting flavors... Slightly spicy, very unique, that ' s for sure. Exactly what ARE the ingredients? [Person1]:  I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations. I ' m sure you can keep a secret. Buttermilk, cacao beans, sugar and Haggis. [Person2]:  Haggis? What ' s Haggis? [Person1]:  It ' s a traditional Scottish delicacy, you take sheep ' s liver, heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep ' s stomach. [Person2]:  Ah, get back to you. [Person1]:  Mr. Johnson? Mr. Johnson?
[Person1]:  Dora, are you interested in going to the museum with me tomorrow? I read the newspaper this morning. I know there is an art exhibition in Taipei Modern Art Museum. [Person2]:  Sure. I am free tomorrow. It sounds interesting to me. Can we buy the ticket online? [Person1]:  I don't think so. I think we had better go there earlier, or we may have to spend a lot of time waiting. [Person2]:  I guess that is the thing we can do with we really want to visit the museum. [Person1]:  Look at the ticket booth in the center. There seems to be not as many people as we thought it would be. [Person2]:  Yeah. We are lucky. Let's go buy the tickets first. We can have breakfast later. I am so hungry. [Person1]:  Good idea. [Person2]:  ( After the breakfast ) Which floor is the art exhibition we are going to? [Person1]:  I have no idea. Let me take a closer look at my museum map [Person2]:  Sure, take your time. We have a whole day. [Person1]:  It's on the 2nd floor. We are going to see some beautiful paintings about the history of ancient Greece. [Person2]:  Look at the museum guide. It says there are also some sculptures and potteries in this area. Let's rent an audio guide.
[Person1]:  what's up? [Person2]:  not much. I'm just trying to hook up to the internet. I'm having a few problems though. [Person1]:  what's wrong? [Person2]:  I've got all the cords plugged in, but it appears that I'm offline. [Person1]:  Are you using dial-up or broadband? [Person2]:  actually, I've got a wireless connection. [Person1]:  In that case, you need to turn on your airport. [Person2]:  I hook up to the Internet every day. I can't believe I didn't do that. [Person1]:  do you like ever chat online? [Person2]:  No, but I'd like to. Do you have to pay to do instant messaging? [Person1]:  Oh, no. You can register for free. Just go to the yahoo website and it will tell you how to do it. [Person2]:  what do you do if people want to talk to you online but you don't want to talk to them? [Person1]:  well, you can always block them. When I don't feel like talking to certain people online, that's what I do. [Person2]:  what's your email address? I'll add you to my contacts list. [Person1]:  it's aubreyinchina@yahoo. com. [Person2]:  cool. We can meet up in a chat room sometime or just chat online using messenger. thanks for your help. [Person1]:  don't mention it.
[Person1]:  Would you like to go skiing with me? I heard the new ski area is great. They have safe tracks, especially for the beginners and provide free training. I think it suits you best. [Person2]:  Sounds not bad! You know, the only thing I worried about is the safety. I'm not an active exerciser and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport. [Person1]:  Well, Then you can go to the three-day-long training camp first. There're some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise. [Person2]:  I will think about it. [Person1]:  Come on! It is really a fun game.
[Person1]:  Did you have a part-time job when you were still in school? [Person2]:  No. I was way too busy studying all the time. How about you? [Person1]:  Yeah. I worked about 20 hours a week in a pizza restaurant. [Person2]:  What was that like? [Person1]:  It was always very busy there. [Person2]:  What did you do? [Person1]:  I stood behind the register and took pizza orders. [Person2]:  Did you get any perks on the job? [Person1]:  Yeah. I got to eat as much pizza as I could for free.
[Person1]:  Do you surf online regularly, Joe? [Person2]:  Of course. I stay online for four hours at least every day. [Person1]:  Are you crazy? What are you doing four hours online? [Person2]:  Millions of things. I surf the Net, check my e-mail, and most importantly, I chat with my friends. [Person1]:  Online chat? Aren't you afraid of meeting bad people who pretend to be what they are not? [Person2]:  No, I am not. And I love to meet new people in the chat rooms who share a lot in common with me. [Person1]:  It sounds interesting.
[Person1]:  Help! Help! [Person2]:  What's the trouble, ma'am? [Person1]:  I was taking a walk when a young man came at me from nowhere and snatched the bag off my hands and ran away. [Person2]:  What did the young man look like? [Person1]:  Well, he's young, tall and thin. [Person2]:  To which direction did he run? [Person1]:  Let me see. . . my right arm. . . oh, to the east.
[Person1]:  Can you suggest a few exercise to help me get fit and stretch my muscles a little? [Person2]:  Sure. If you want to stretch your legs, a good exercise is to lift your knee in front of your body, like this. It's a very simple exercise, but very effective. [Person1]:  I need to excise my arms too. How can I do that? [Person2]:  One good way is to do push-ups. Another way is to use weights. Make sure you grip the weights firmly. You don't want to drop them on your feet! [Person1]:  When I do push-ups, should I bend my elbows so that my nose touches the ground? [Person2]:  You don't need to bend your elbows that much. Bend them so that your arms are at a 90 degree angle. The most important think is to remember to keep your body straight. Many people bend their bodies at the waist, which reduces the effectiveness of the exercise. [Person1]:  What's a good exercise for my chest muscles? [Person2]:  One that I recommend is that you lie on your back. You should have a weight in each hand and stretch your arms out either side of your body. [Person1]:  So I need plenty of space for this exercise. [Person2]:  Yes, you do. Lift the weight up, keeping your arms straight all the time. [Person1]:  Great. Thanks for you advice!
[Person1]:  Excuse me, Ma'am. I would like to mail this package door to door via airmail to London. It is a very important package and has to be sent within 3 days. [Person2]:  No problem. But, the postage is much higher than the regular package. [Person1]:  That's fine with me. I am willing to pay for it as long as you can guarantee me the package can arrive in time. [Person2]:  OK. All the registered airmail packages can be received in 5 working days. [Person1]:  I see. How much do I need to pay in total for this package? [Person2]:  It's 500 dollars. [Person1]:  Can I have the receipt? Just in case I can trace it if something goes wrong. [Person2]:  Sure! Please just fill in your I. D. number and ways to contact you here. [Person1]:  Do I need to include my zip code in the address? [Person2]:  You had better include that because it is easier for the mailmen to find the correct mailing address. [Person1]:  Thank you very much. Here is 500 dollars. [Person2]:  Here is your receipt. Contact us if your friend still doesn't receive the package after 5 work days.
[Person1]:  Good morning, sir. Can I help you? [Person2]:  Good day. I'm looking for a one-bedroom apartment today. [Person1]:  Certainly. How much rent did you want to pay? [Person2]:  Well, I didn't want to pay more than $ 900 a month. [Person1]:  $ 900 a month? We don't often have apartment as inexpensive as that. We have one apartment for $ 985 a month today, on Eleventh Avenue. It's near the municipal buildings. [Person2]:  Is it furnished? [Person1]:  No, it's unfurnished. It has a kitchen, but there are not many cookers. There's a garden in the back, but the tenants can't use it. The landlord lives downstairs. Friends are forbidden in the apartment after midnight. No noise and no television after 11. . . [Person2]:  No, thank you! I want to take an apartment, not a prison. [Person1]:  Ok, we would do as your requirement. And we'll contact with you later!
[Person1]:  It's a beautiful day here in New Zealand at the Men's Volleyball world championship. My name is Rick Fields and I'm joined by the man with the plan, Bob Copeland. [Person2]:  Thank you, Rick. We'Ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams, Brazil and China, face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round. Without a doubt, both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match. [Person1]:  The ref signals the start of the game and here we go. Ribero serves and China quickly receives the ball. Chen bumps it to the setter, and. . . a very nice set by Chen! [Person2]:  Xu spikes it! Wow, what a great hit! The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in! Great play. [Person1]:  It's China's service now. What a superb jump serve by Li, oh, and we have a let serve. The ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net. [Person2]:  Brazil calls for a time out and we'll be right back, after a short commercial break.
[Person1]:  Operator, can I help you? [Person2]:  Yes. I'd like to make a collect call. My number is 7683384. [Person1]:  And the number you're dialing? [Person2]:  That's 7638558. Oh, no, I'm sorry, I forgot it's just changed. It's now 7643388. [Person1]:  Please hold the line, caller.
[Person1]:  It's seven o'clock already, dear. [Person2]:  Yes, I know. I decided to work during the evening rush hour. [Person1]:  And so your dinner's cold. Why do you work so hard? [Person2]:  I just start, and then I can't stop. [Person1]:  You can stop any time. You don't need to keep on working at all. [Person2]:  And then what could I do? [Person1]:  We could move to Florida. [Person2]:  Oh, Florida. Is it any better than New York? [Person1]:  It's warm and sunny all year round. No more snow, no more ice. [Person2]:  And what about the children and the grandchildren? [Person1]:  They could come, and visit us every winter. [Person2]:  And what would we do every spring, summer, and fall? [Person1]:  A lot of our friends have moved to Florida. We know a lot of people there. [Person2]:  Well, I'll think about it.
[Person1]:  What do you think of this dress? Do you think it suits me?  [Person2]:  Sure. Why don't you try it on? The fitting room is over there.  [Person1]:  It's just the right size-a perfect fit! Have you seen anything you like?  [Person2]:  I'm thinking about buying this sweater. I know it's june now, but it will be perfect for autumn and winter.  [Person1]:  It looks too big for you, but I like the color and the material is good quality. Is it on sale?  [Person2]:  Yes, it's half price. It's supposed to be too large-that's the fashion.  [Person1]:  I might get one too, but in a different colour. I prefer light blue to while.  [Person2]:  There. It looks great, don't you think? I'm going to get these jeans as well. I need a new pair. I need a new pair. I 'm also going to buy this scarf ready for winter.  [Person1]:   [Person2]:  Don't worry. I've got my credit card. You can pay me back later.  [Person1]:  Thanks! Now I don't need to come back to the shop a second time. 
[Person1]:  Do you believe in god?  [Person2]:  Not at all. I'm an agnostic. Do you?  [Person1]:  I'm not sure. Why don't you believe there is a god?  [Person2]:  I think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one.  [Person1]:  I basically believe in science over theology. I mean, I believe in evolution for example. However, there are many things that science hasn't explained yet.  [Person2]:  I'm sure that science will explain everything eventually. I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong.  [Person1]:  For example?  [Person2]:  Religions preach tolerance, but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics.  [Person1]:  Yes. Such people don't appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs. 
[Person1]:  What do you think are the main causes of war today?  [Person2]:  I'd say the main reason is poverty. Countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little. If their neighbors have some resources, they try to steal them by military force.  [Person1]:  It seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars. People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country.  [Person2]:  Several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years. It seems they will never end.  [Person1]:  How do you think they could be ended?  [Person2]:  I don't think that there is any easy way. The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country. At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate. The thing is to find the real problem form the war and solve that.  [Person1]:  So, if the cause is poverty, there should be a program to make the country richer. If the problem is resources, share them.  [Person2]:  It sounds easy when you say it like that. In reality, it's harder to make peace between countries.  [Person1]:  Yes. It is. One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support. Wars are very expensive.  [Person2]:  The problem is that many poor people might suffer. 
[Person1]:  Is there a lot of crime in your city?  [Person2]:  There's some, but I don't think it's a big problem. A lot of it is petty crime, burglary and car theft. There's very little major crime.  [Person1]:  It's the same in my city. We also have a lot of drug addicts. A lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs.  [Person2]:  That happens in many places. In my city, there is a very good drug rehabilitation program. The police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes, but I don't know if that's the reason for our relatively low crime rate.  [Person1]:  Some people believe that a tough approach is better. Other prefer a more lenient approach.  [Person2]:  I think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly. If most people have similar amounts of money, they will not think of stealing from others.  [Person1]:  That's possible, but I'm not sure it would really happen like that. 
[Person1]:  Hi Peter, what are you doing? [Person2]:  I am reading some papers about stock. [Person1]:  Ah, Great! I happen to want to ask you something about it! [Person2]:  Yes, sure. What it is? [Person1]:  When it comes to select a fund, many people will always read 'Past performance is not an indication of future results', do you believe that? [Person2]:  Maybe it is right since everything is possible. You know the market changes quickly these days. [Person1]:  Do you really think so? But I still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance. For me, a stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy. I really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns. [Person2]:  If you refuse to take risk, you can't have better returns. [Person1]:  Sure, maybe you are right. I will think about it. Thanks a lot! [Person2]:  You are most welcome.
[Person1]:  Daddy, are you going to the park with us this weekend? [Person2]:  Honey, I have a lot of work to do. [Person1]:  So you can't go with us, right? [Person2]:  No. [Person1]:  Daddy, you always arrange your schedule so tight on weekdays. You should have a rest on weekends. [Person2]:  What park do you want to go to? [Person1]:  Daniel wants to go to the aquarium. While Mom wants to visit the Summer Palace. [Person2]:  Haven't we been these places already? [Person1]:  Yeah. I don't agree with them, but I don't have a better choice. [Person2]:  What about the Olympic park? [Person1]:  Right, ah. It is so close to our home. How come we've never thought of that? [Person2]:  The Olympic Park has a small forest. It is fit for picnic. [Person1]:  Very well, Go ahead.
[Person1]:  Sally, you look so corporate! What interview do you have today? [Person2]:  Amalgamated Trading Company. It's Swiss. Don't you think working at a foreign company would be glamorous? [Person1]:  Yeah, I guess so. I've never actually heard of this one, but... [Person2]:  Well, it's small, but it's a young, dynamic, rapidly-growing company with a progressive, humanistic philosophy. [Person1]:  You didn't read their brochure or anything, did you? [Person2]:  Four times. I'm totally prepared. Oh, no! I forgot to take off my nail polish! And I have to be there in 15 minutes! That's it. I blew it. [Person1]:  Well, they are progressive and humanistic-maybe they don't care about nail polish... uh... even blue nail polish. Just keep your confidence up and you'll do great. [Person2]:  But the competition is fierce this year... and it seems like I'm the only one left who hasn't found a job. [Person1]:  Not quite the only one. I really wanted that job at the magazine, but I still haven't heard from them.
[Person1]:  How can we develop a new brand image with no direction whatsoever? [Person2]:  With the fifty forwards he sent out today, maybe we'll inadvertently get inspired. [Person1]:  I guess this is a good excuse to surf the Net on someone else's dime. [Person2]:  Who'd have thought Bean would be this kind of e-mail fanatic? [Person1]:  He must have just got online for the first time last week. He still thinks it's some kind of new toy.
[Person1]:  Honey, we are all out of wine and cheese. Do you mind running to the deli and picking up a few things? [Person2]:  Can't it wait? I'm watching the game right now! [Person1]:  Your friends and family are coming over tonight and we still need to get a lot of things. [Person2]:  Fine! What do you need? [Person1]:  OK, pick up some cured meats to go with the wine. Maybe a pound of polish sausages, ham, liverwurst, salami and any other cold cuts that are on sale. I think I saw a promotion for pastrami. Also get some cole slaw and a jar of olives. [Person2]:  Whoa wait a minute! Isn't that a bit too much? I mean, how much is all of this going to cost! [Person1]:  Never mind that. Get some dips as well. Get a jar of spinach and blue cheese dip and also some Tzatziki. If they have bean dip get that as well. Last but not least, get some pickles. [Person2]:  Is that all, your majesty? [Person1]:  Very funny! Get a move on! People will be here any minute.
[Person1]:  Mr.  [Person2]:  What are they? [Person1]:  Mr.  [Person2]:  Wow! [Person1]:  Mr.  [Person2]:  Two waves? [Person1]:  Mr.  [Person2]:  And the other half come in later to pick up the second wave.
[Person1]:  It's going to strike 12 o'clock. Let's get the firecrackers ready, Rose. [Person2]:  Aren't firecrackers forbidden in the city? [Person1]:  Well yes, but they are not allowed only in downtown areas. It's OK here. It would be difficult to ban customs that have thousands of years of tradition. The habit does bring kids joy and excitement so long as precautions are taken. Let's go out and set off firecrackers out there. [Person2]:  Fantastic! The whole city is echoing with crackling sounds! [Person1]:  What other activities will you have tomorrow? [Person2]:  Quite a lot. The celebration of the New Year has just started. The first day we southerners have sweet rice cakes for breakfast, and people in the North have Jiaozi. Afterward, we will make New Year calls on family relatives, husband's side on the first day and wife's side on the second. [Person1]:  Do you bring some gifts along? [Person2]:  That's for sure. Fruit, cream cakes, medical tonics are often for parents and aged relatives, and cash enclosed in a red envelope for the kids. All this, of course, should be well prepared beforehand. [Person1]:  Is it the same practice for all families? [Person2]:  Not all the same nowadays I must say. Many families, especially those of newly married couples, choose to make an overseas trip to escape the routines. Rose and I had a tour to Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Hong Kong last year. We stayed there for two weeks until the last day of the holiday. [Person1]:  I really appreciate the way you Chinese people exchange feelings. The holiday's long enough for you to relax. [Person2]:  Well, for city dwellers, the Spring Festival is a holiday of seven days. While in the country where traditions are still heavily emphasized, the festival lasts ten days.
[Person1]:  Hi. You enjoying the party? [Person2]:  Yes, actually. I don't really know anyone, but it's a nice place. Are you having a good time? [Person1]:  Yes. The drinks are very good! I'm Paul, by the way. [Person2]:  Hello Paul. I'm Jane. So what do you do? [Person1]:  I'm in finance. You? [Person2]:  Really? Me, too. I work for an accountancy company, T & D. Maybe you've heard of them. [Person1]:  T & D? Oh, yes, sure. How long have you worked there? [Person2]:  About two years. And you? Are you based here? [Person1]:  No. Actually, I'm based in Shanghai. I'm just here for the conference. So, T & D eh. . .
[Person1]:  How about the repair fee? [Person2]:  It's for free, because your computers are still in the period of guarantee--two years. [Person1]:  Great! When can your technicians come to our factory? [Person2]:  They are working in another factory to provide maintenance right now. Let me call them and see whether they have solved the problem. Please wait a moment. [Person1]:  I've just contacted our technicians. They say they can go to your factory tomorrow afternoon. Can you tell me your factory's address, so they can find you easier? [Person2]:  That's wonderful. I appreciate your efficiency and cooperation. [Person1]:  To provide the As excellent after-sales service is our motto. Please wait for our maintenance staff in your factory tomorrow afternoon. They will be there on time. [Person2]:  Thank you again!
[Person1]:  I would like to exchange Chinese money into German currency please. [Person2]:  Certainly. How much will you be exchanging today? [Person1]:  How about 50, 000 RIB. Would that be a problem? [Person2]:  That's a hefty amount. But that should have no problem at all. You should be aware that there is a ten-percent service charge, though. [Person1]:  Ten percent! Now that's hefty! [Person2]:  Wait a minute. . . do you have an account with us? [Person1]:  Yes I do; here is my account number. [Person2]:  For members, there is a small transaction charge, but it's only 5 dollars per transaction. Any particular denomination? [Person1]:  3, 000 marks in hundreds and the rest in tens and twenty's, please. [Person2]:  Here you are Mr. Lee. Will there be anything else?
[Person1]:  Hello! 6896443. [Person2]:  Hello! Is that Lucy? [Person1]:  Speaking! [Person2]:  Hi! This is Tom! Can I speak to Lily? [Person1]:  Sorry. She isn't in at the moment. Can I take a message? [Person2]:  Could you please tell her not to wait for me this evening? We planned to go to a party together, but something important came up and I have to rush off. I'll be back in Cairo at the beginning of next week. [Person1]:  Right. I'll tell her. Are you leaving now? [Person2]:  Yes, I leave at half past two. Please give my love to her. Thank you! [Person1]:  You're welcome. [Person2]:  Could you ask her to phone me when she gets in? [Person1]:  Sure. You'd better give me your number. [Person2]:  Yes, it's 13962-72854. [Person1]:  OK. I've recorded it. [Person2]:  Thanks very much indeed. Bye! [Person1]:  Bye!
[Person1]:  I'll be away for a moment.  [Person2]:  Yes? Anything I can do for you?  [Person1]:  Look! I'v been watching that man down in the street. He keeps peeping into the shop. Keep your eyes skinned for that guy, will you?  [Person2]:  Ok. 
[Person1]:  Hey, Sarah. This year I'm going to the rock festival for all three days. [Person2]:  Oh, lucky you, Leo. Are you going with your cousin again? [Person1]:  Not this year. My brother has promised at take me there now. My sister is too busy with her college work. [Person2]:  How will you get there? [Person1]:  We want to drive but dad said no and it's too far from the city for us to cycle there. But there are special buses so we'll use those. [Person2]:  What do you have to take with you? [Person1]:  Just a tent in clothes really. We'll need lots of water but we'll buy that an all our meals there. Hey, come with us. [Person2]:  Maybe I will.
[Person1]:  Sir, the plane will be landing in Moscow in 20 minutes. Please remain seated. [Person2]:  I'm sorry. I just wanted to get something to drink. I'm so thirsty, can you bring me a glass of water? [Person1]:  Sure, I'll be back with it in just a minute. Please wait for a moment. [Person2]:  Thank you very much, by the way, what's the weather like in Moscow now? [Person1]:  It's very cold. You should probably put on your coat before you get off the plane. [Person2]:  Thanks for reminding me. [Person1]:  You're welcome.
[Person1]:  Here we go. Now, Terry, you were saying that you went from Vancouver to San Diego. How many days did that take? [Person2]:  Um, the total trip took 42 days but that included one day on the bus up and then one day on the bus back. [Person1]:  That is so cool, so first you have your bike in your hometown and you put your bike on the bus and you took the bus to Vancouver. [Person2]:  Right. Yeah, you had to put your bike in a bicycle box. [Person1]:  You are carrying everything you have with you so you need to take care of your bicycle. [Person2]:  Yes, I can stop and bicycle shops along the way but I also need to maintain my bicycle by myself if I can't find anyone to help. [Person1]:  OK. So when you are taking a trip what tools do you need to take with you to take care of your bicycle? [Person2]:  Oh, just some basic tools and 2 or 3 tires. [Person1]:  That's cool. Thank you Terry.
[Person1]:  What shall we do tonight? [Person2]:  How about the cinema? [Person1]:  That's a good idea. We haven't seen a film for ages. What would you like to see? [Person2]:  Oh I don't know. Titanic? [Person1]:  Titanic? That old film? but I've seen it before!
[Person1]:  You look happy. [Person2]:  I am happy. I just bought a new car. [Person1]:  Wow! Is it a good car? [Person2]:  It's a great car. It's very comfortable and it goes really fast. [Person1]:  Was it expensive? [Person2]:  Put it this way, it wasn't cheap. [Person1]:  What colour is it? [Person2]:  It's red and black.
[Person1]:  Hi, Francis. [Person2]:  Oh, Mike. How are you doing? [Person1]:  Not bad. It seems you are super yogurt lover. You have so many in your cart. [Person2]:  Well, I prefer yogurt to all the other drinks. Have you ever tried a kind of yogurt with old milk in it? It tastes great and very healthy too. [Person1]:  Oh, I haven't noticed that before. Maybe I will try next time. [Person2]:  Why don't you go ahead of me? I have more items than you. [Person1]:  Thank you. In fact, I am in a hurry. My wife is waiting for me at the parking lot. [Person2]:  You're welcome. It was good seeing you again. [Person1]:  Me too. Have a great day.
[Person1]:  I always think everybody looks down on me [Person2]:  Don't be that negative. [Person1]:  How can you be optimistic? You can see it in their eyes. [Person2]:  I find it there is no meaning in living this world. [Person1]:  Don't be that negative. [Person2]:  Really, life is so boring.
[Person1]:  You're new here, right? [Person2]:  Yes, I am new. [Person1]:  Is this your first semester? [Person2]:  I just transferred from another school. [Person1]:  What school did you transfer from? [Person2]:  I came here from PCC. [Person1]:  Do you like it here so far? [Person2]:  I am really enjoying it here so far. [Person1]:  Which is better, here or PCC? [Person2]:  I think PCC is a lot better than here. [Person1]:  Why didn't you just stay at PCC? [Person2]:  I graduated and now want to get a BA.
[Person1]:  You know that this job requires frequent business travel. Can you accept it? [Person2]:  Yes, I can. [Person1]:  Mostly short business trips, but sometimes long ones are also needed. [Person2]:  Then how about the expenses during the trips? [Person1]:  The company will pay all the expenses. [Person2]:  Would you tell me where we often travel? [Person1]:  Usually Shanghai, Qingdao, Hong Kong and so on. [Person2]:  It's great! I like these places. [Person1]:  And you need to go abroad once in a while. Can you? [Person2]:  Yes, I can. [Person1]:  After the business trip, you could apply for reimbursement of all the expenses, such as passage money and accommodation charges and so on. [Person2]:  I see. [Person1]:  You can take a break for one or two weeks after you have a business trip every time, which depends on the circumstances. [Person2]:  OK. Thank you very much for telling me all these things.
[Person1]:  You'v been work here for nearly a month, how do you feel about the job? [Person2]:  Not bad. Thank you for your help. I am always busy with this job, I feel a bit tired. [Person1]:  I had the same feeling when I first came to work here. but after a period of time, I feel better, I am sure you'll get used to this busy job. [Person2]:  I also feel that work efficiency here is very high. and you have strong working ability and professional skill, it seems that you know all, that's really wonderful! [Person1]:  You know the phrase, the survival the fittest. We have no choices. [Person2]:  That's right, I have to work hard.
[Person1]:  What are you doing? [Person2]:  What am I doing? What am I doing? Don't you know what day it is? [Person1]:  Mumm. no. [Person2]:  It's only the day when the world's biggest sporting event is kicking off. [Person1]:  What? [Person2]:  The World Cup! The first match is today! It's Mexico vs. South Africa! It's going to be a really good match! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players. I think that South Africa will probably dominate the first half since they are the host country, and all. [Person1]:  I have no idea what you're talking about. The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl. [Person2]:  This is bigger than the Super Bowl, man! Teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy. They first start in a group stage with bigger groups, each group having 4 teams. The top 2 teams pass on to an elimination stage before going on to the quarter final sand semifinals. [Person1]:  Sounds interesting, but soccer doesn't really appeal to me. [Person2]:  Are you kidding? Over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the World Cup! It's a very exciting and nerve wracking sport! Each nation is cheering on their team, hoping they will become the next champion. So far Brazil is the team with the most titles under their belt ; they're really good! [Person1]:  All I know about soccer is that you can't use your hands and that players are always falling down, trying to get a free kick or penalty kick. It seems like a sissy sport to me! [Person2]:  Whatever dude, I'm going to go watch the opening match.
[Person1]:  Good morning, sir. May I help you? [Person2]:  Yes, thank you. I want to get a handbag. [Person1]:  Do you want it for yourself or for your girlfriend? [Person2]:  No, I have no girlfriend. [Person1]:  Please excuse me for what I said just now. What do you think of this one? [Person2]:  I am afraid it is too big. [Person1]:  Sorry. It is the smallest size we have. [Person2]:  Too bad. But, is there any other leather store nearby? [Person1]:  Oh, yes. There is a big one at the right corner of the street. Perhaps you will get one there. [Person2]:  I hope so. Thanks.
[Person1]:  Excuse me! [Person2]:  Yes. Can I help you? [Person1]:  We're ready to order. A cup of coffee for me, and a glass of oranges for her. [Person2]:  Yes, how would you like your coffee? [Person1]:  Just black coffee. Do you serve anything else besides drinks, say cake. [Person2]:  We also serve sandwiches and cakes. [Person1]:  Give me two pieces of cake.
[Person1]:  How may I help you? [Person2]:  I need to check these books out. [Person1]:  Do you have your library card? [Person2]:  Here it is. [Person1]:  It appears that you have late fees. [Person2]:  Really? [Person1]:  Yes, really. [Person2]:  How much do I owe? [Person1]:  You owe $ 24. 50 in late fees. [Person2]:  I don't have that much today. [Person1]:  I'm sorry, but until you pay it, you won't be able to check out any more books. [Person2]:  I'll pay it as soon as possible.
[Person1]:  Good evening and welcome to tonight's edition of Legendary Lives. Our subject this evening is James Dean, actor and hero for the young people of his time. Edward Murray is the author of a new biography of Dean. Good evening, Edward. [Person2]:  Hello Tina. [Person1]:  Edward, tell us what you know about Dean's early life. [Person2]:  He was born in Indiana in 1931, but his parents moved to California when he was five. He wasn't there long though because his mother passed away just four years later. Jimmy's father sent him back to Indiana after that to live with his aunt. [Person1]:  So how did he get into acting? [Person2]:  Well, first he acted in plays at high school, then he went to college in California where he got seriously into acting. In 1951 he moved to New York to do more stage acting. [Person1]:  Then when did his movie career really start? [Person2]:  1955. His first starring role was in East of Eden. It was fabulous. Dean became a huge success. But the movie that really made him famous was his second one, Rebel Without a Cause, that was about teenagers who felt like they didn't fit into society. [Person1]:  So how many more movies did he make? [Person2]:  Just one more, then he died in that car crash in California in 1955. [Person1]:  What a tragedy! He only made three movies! So what made him the legend he still is today? [Person2]:  Well I guess his looks, his acting ability, his short life, and maybe the type of character he played in his movies. Many young people saw him as a symbol of American youths.
[Person1]:  Lily, don't you think the scholarship from New York University is something great? Why did you decline this offer? [Person2]:  I do realize the value of the scholarship. But, if I could explain, my mother doesn't want me to go overseas. [Person1]:  Why? [Person2]:  You know, I'm the only child in the family. My mother will be living alone most of the time for three years in my absence. She cannot even think of it. [Person1]:  Nobody to take care of her? [Person2]:  My father travels a lot to many countries and he is doing business in Dubai now. I have to do a lot for my mom at home. [Person1]:  Oh, I see. You are very considerate.
[Person1]:  Would you help me for a minute,please? [Person2]:  Of course. What do you want me to do? [Person1]:  Could you hold these packages while I look for the key to the door? [Person2]:  I'd be glad to. What's in these packages? They're extremely heavy. [Person1]:  Just the things we need for the picnic tomorrow. [Person2]:  Well, hurry up and open the door. I told you these things were very heavy. [Person1]:  I can't find the key. You must have it. [Person2]:  You're right, but how can I get the key while I'm holding all these packages?
[Person1]:  What kind of music do you like listening to?  [Person2]:  I like music that has a fast beat and is lively, like dance music. You know, I go to a disco almost every week. Sometimes it's too loud though. You prefer classical music, don't you?  [Person1]:  Yes, I do. I find it very relaxing. I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work.  [Person2]:  I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music. It's certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music.  [Person1]:  Classical music is supposed to be good for you brain. Research suggest that it makes your brain more active. Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better.  [Person2]:  Really? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often. I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress.  [Person1]:  Yes. That's why I listen to it in the evenings. I usually play it as background music while I'm cooking or doing other housework.  [Person2]:  I've got a few classical music CD's. I should follow your lead and increase my brian power.  [Person1]:  You can find plenty of recording on the internet too. You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them.  [Person2]:  That's a good idea. You should do the same with some music. You might find something you like. Classical music might make you clever, but dance might make you livelier and happier.  [Person1]:  That's true. There's clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people. Music can influence a person's feeling and character. 
[Person1]:  Where are you going to take your vacation? [Person2]:  Hawaii. [Person1]:  That sounds like a great place to visit. Is your family going? [Person2]:  Yes, we plan to go mountain climbing, fishing, swimming and windsurfing. But most of all we are planning to relax. My wife is taking a whole bunch of books to read. [Person1]:  Your children must all be excited about it. [Person2]:  Yes, they are. They're counting the days. Are you going to Europe again this summer? [Person1]:  No, not this time. We're going to visit some old friends in Egypt.
[Person1]:  I want a ticket to New York, one way please. [Person2]:  That'll be $285. How would you like to pay? [Person1]:  Credit card. I don't like to pay in cash because it's quite inconvenient. [Person2]:  OK, I see. [Person1]:  Oh, by the way, my doctor advised me not to eat any meat. Last time I had a special salad plate. I'd like to have it again this time. [Person2]:  I'm sorry, I'm not able to do that. Otherwise, we would need 24-hours notice for special meals. Here is your ticket. [Person1]:  Thank you. Oh, my! I forgot to bring my credit card. Let me see. Oh, fortunately there is enough cash in my wallet.
[Person1]:  Hi Sam, it's 8 [Person2]:  I don't really want to get up. [Person1]:  What would you like for breakfast, Sam? [Person2]:  I'm not quite hungry now, let me think for a while. What kind of food do you prepare mom? [Person1]:  Sandwiches, bread and vegetables. [Person2]:  Are they chicken sandwiches or vegetable ones? [Person1]:  Chicken sandwiches. [Person2]:  Great, they're my favorite! [Person1]:  What do you want to drink? Juice or milk? [Person2]:  Milk, please. [Person1]:  Wash your hands before you eat. [Person2]:  Ok, mom, but where's dad? [Person1]:  He's sleeping. [Person2]:  Sleeping? Why? It's 8 [Person1]:  No, Sam, he slept rather late last night, because he went to the station to meet his friend. Don't wake him up, let him sleep a little more. [Person2]:  Ok, mom.
[Person1]:  What are you here for today? [Person2]:  I need to fight this ticket that I got. [Person1]:  Is the arresting officer here? [Person2]:  Yes, he is, Your Honor. [Person1]:  Plead your case. [Person2]:  I was told by the officer that I ran a red light. That information isn't true. [Person1]:  Why would the officer lie? [Person2]:  I'm not sure, but the signal had a camera on it. [Person1]:  Did the camera take a picture of your license plate? [Person2]:  No, my picture wasn't taken. [Person1]:  There was no picture taken, so I'll let you go. [Person2]:  Thank you very much, Your Honor.
[Person1]:  Jim, why were you late for school this morning? [Person2]:  I'm sorry, Mrs. Brown. [Person1]:  Did you get up late? [Person2]:  No. I got up at 7 [Person1]:  It only takes you about 20 minutes to walk to school. Why were you late? [Person2]:  Well, on my way to school I saw a boy lying on the street. He had fallen off his bike. I ran to help him and found he was injured. [Person1]:  What did you do? [Person2]:  I took him to the nearest hospital. [Person1]:  You did the right thing, Jim. [Person2]:  Thanks, Mrs. Brown.
[Person1]:  Hello, madam. How do you like your staying here? [Person2]:  Quite good. Excuse me, are there any places of interest? [Person1]:  Yes, there are so many near our hoteI.Three blocks away from here, there is temple. It's famous for its building and paintings.lt ' s worth visiting. [Person2]:  Thank you. I think today we will go there.
[Person1]:  I'd like to meet you again sometime. [Person2]:  That would be great. Actually, can I get your phone number, Ella? That's assuming you don't mind if I call you sometime. [Person1]:  Anytime. You can reach me at 5558929. [Person2]:  Ok, got it. I will call you sometime next week. [Person1]:  Fine. [Person2]:  It's time to go. Bye, Ella. Hope to see you soon [Person1]:  Bye, Jason.
[Person1]:  Hello! How are you. [Person2]:  Not too well! I'm just to the doctor. I haven't been feeling too well over the last few days. [Person1]:  What have you got? A cough? A cold? [Person2]:  That's the funny thing. I don't what's wrong with me. I just feel exhausted. [Person1]:  Perhaps you'Ve been working too hard. You do have a high-pressure job. [Person2]:  Maybe. I haven't been able to keep my food down either. That's unusual. [Person1]:  Well. I'm sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again. Dr. Jameson is very good. [Person2]:  Yes, he is. I'Ve make an appointment for 10 o'clock, so I'd better move along. [Person1]:  OK. Hope you feel better soon. You should take it easy. I'm sure the doctor will prescribe rest, you know.
[Person1]:  I am trying to decide what school to apply to? [Person2]:  Are you thinking about a public school or a private one? [Person1]:  I am not sure. What's the difference between them? [Person2]:  Public schools are usually state funded, whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere. [Person1]:  Which is better? [Person2]:  One isn't necessarily better than the other. It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers. [Person1]:  I hear you have to wear uniforms at private schools. [Person2]:  Yes, sometimes.
[Person1]:  welcome back! How was your vacation? [Person2]:  it was fantastic, but I'm glad to be back! Being a tourist is really tiring! [Person1]:  where did you end up going? [Person2]:  because it's off-season, we got a really good package deal to Paris, so we went there. [Person1]:  I've always wanted to go to Paris. The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world! Did you go to the top? [Person2]:  that was the first thing we did. I have a few pictures. Do you want to see them? [Person1]:  sure. What's this one a picture of? [Person2]:  oh, that's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling. I'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city. [Person1]:  you don't look very happy in that picture. [Person2]:  no, by that time, I was sick of sightseeing. I had had enough of art galleries, cathedrals, fountains, statues, and palaces! [Person1]:  so what did you do? [Person2]:  we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market. We had a few coffees, watched a movie, and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel. [Person1]:  my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing. Did you go to the Louvre? [Person2]:  of course! You can't go to Paris without going to their famous art gallery! I was surprised by how small the Mona Lisa was though. [Person1]:  that's what everyone says! I can't wait to see it for myself some day.
[Person1]:  Who got ripped off? [Person2]:  Big time! A hacker broke into the company's files and got all her personal information. You really think it's completely safe? [Person1]:  Well, maybe not 100 percent. I did hear about some tricks people use. [Person2]:  Now we're getting to the truth. [Person1]:  There are shills. A shill is someone who bids up the price of their own sale. [Person2]:  See? And I bet that's easy to do online. Everybody's anonymous.
[Person1]:  I'm famished! Let's get some grub! [Person2]:  I'm in the mood for some chips and salsa. [Person1]:  Me, too! The chips here are so light and crispy. [Person2]:  And they have tangy, freshly-made salsa, too. My mouth is watering already! [Person1]:  I'll go get the chips. What do you want to drink? [Person2]:  Surprise me.
[Person1]:  Have you got anything for diarrhea? [Person2]:  Yes, here you are. These tablets are very effective. [Person1]:  How should I take this medicine? [Person2]:  Take two tablets every six hours. [Person1]:  I see. I'll follow your instructions. [Person2]:  And take a good rest for a few days. [Person1]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  Good morning. What can I do for you, sir? [Person2]:  I'd like to see some coats. Would you recommend me some of them? [Person1]:  Sure. Come to look at these styles. They sell very well. [Person2]:  Which models do you sell the most? [Person1]:  How about these? They are the current bestsellers. [Person2]:  I like this style, but I don't like its color. Do you have this coat in yellow? [Person1]:  Yes, I will find one for you. Here you are. It's made of exceptionally good quality, pure wool, and is very soft. [Person2]:  It looks nice. [Person1]:  Yeah, this is the latest model. If you like it, you can try it on.
[Person1]:  Good Morning. What can I do for you? [Person2]:  Good Morning, I have a bad cough, and I want to see an internist. [Person1]:  Do you have a registration card? [Person2]:  No, I don't. I'm a tourist. [Person1]:  Then you need to register as a new patient. Can I have a look at you ID card? I need your name, age, occupation, address and contacting number. [Person2]:  Here you are. [Person1]:  Thanks. Which kind of medicine do you prefer, western medicine or traditional Chinese medicine? [Person2]:  I'd like to try traditional Chinese medicine. I heard it really works quite well if you know what you're doing. [Person1]:  All right. Yes, he does. The registration fee is 7 yuan, please.
[Person1]:  Let's play a little game. I'll describe someone and you try to guess who it is. [Person2]:  Ok. I'm really bored at the moment. [Person1]:  Ok. This man is tall and slim. He's got blue eyes and curly brown hair. [Person2]:  Does he have a moustache or a beard? [Person1]:  Good question. Yes, he has a moustache, but no beard. [Person2]:  Sounds like Mike, is it? [Person1]:  Yes, it is. You describe someone we both know. [Person2]:  Right. She's not very tall and she's quite plump. She's got blonder hair, but I don't know what color her eyes are. [Person1]:  Is she attractive? I don't think I know anyone like that. [Person2]:  Well, I don't find her attractive, but I'm sure you will disagree. [Person1]:  I like slim girls, so I doubt I would find a plump girl attractive. You'll have to give me some more information. [Person2]:  She's got tiny feet and wears really unfashionable shoes. In fact, she wears unfashionable clothes too. [Person1]:  This doesn't sound like anyone I know. I give up. Teel me who she is. [Person2]:  She's your mother! [Person1]:  How embarrassing! I don't even recognize a description of my own mother! How important do you think appearance is? [Person2]:  I think that unfortunately it's more important than a person's character. Advertising and stuff tells us that we have to be attractive. I think it's wrong, but that's the way the world is now. [Person1]:  I'm afraid you're right. I chose my girlfriend because she has a wonderful personality. [Person2]:  Well, you certainly didn't choose her because of her looks! Hey, I was joking! Don't hit me!
[Person1]:  6652-767. [Person2]:  Hello. Could I speak to Alistair, please? [Person1]:  Speaking. Is that you, Bill? [Person2]:  Hello yes, it's me. I didn't recognize your voice. [Person1]:  I've got a bit of cold. What can I do for you? [Person2]:  Well, we're meeting Bob's girlfriend and her parents tonight giving them dinner. I've just opened the box of champagne glasses and there are two glasses missing. Have you got a set you can lend to me, by any chance? [Person1]:  Sure, sure, glad to. When do you need them? [Person2]:  Well, can I come over in a quarter of an hour? I've got to go to Marilyn's for some sugar first - I've run out of that as well. [Person1]:  Is that all you need? Anything else you are short of? [Person2]:  No, I think I'm all right otherwise. Thanks a lot, Alistair. See you in a bit. [Person1]:  Bye.
[Person1]:  Have you got your schedule for this term, Monica? [Person2]:  Yes, Yuri, I have. It's going to be quite a hard term. [Person1]:  Really? What subjects are you taking? [Person2]:  I've got culture studies on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8 [Person1]:  Oh, 8 [Person2]:  Yes. Straight after that at 10 [Person1]:  That sounds OK. Do you have afternoons free? [Person2]:  Only on Tuesdays and Thursdays. On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, I've got language development at 2 [Person1]:  That sounds interesting. What other classes do you have? [Person2]:  I've got education on Monday morning at 9 [Person1]:  Wow, that's a lot of classes. [Person2]:  I know. I hope they'll be good.
[Person1]:  It's raining again. Tom, bring me the umbrella. [Person2]:  Well, mom. I'm sorry to tell you that I left it on the bus. [Person1]:  Again? Don't you know that umbrella is expensive? You always leave our umbrellas on the bus, don't you? [Person2]:  I'm sorry, mom. I won't let it happen again. [Person1]:  It's no use saying sorry. You should be more careful and remember to take the umbrella with you when you get off the bus next time, OK? [Person2]:  OK. I won't lose anymore umbrellas, mom. [Person1]:  Anyway, just give me your cellphone, then you won't focus on it and lose the umbrella. You are having trouble with your study because of your phone, too. [Person2]:  OK, if you want.
[Person1]:  Did you get to talk to the Browns about their trip to Venezuela? [Person2]:  Oh yes, they said they had a great time. [Person1]:  What did they say the weather was like? [Person2]:  They said it was extremely cool. They suggested that we take some warm clothes. [Person1]:  Did you ask how the hotels were? [Person2]:  It seems they're excellent and not expensive. [Person1]:  Yeah, that's what I've heard. Did they say if they had any language problem? [Person2]:  Sometimes. They told me that hardly anybody speaks English, except the people on the hotels. But the staff of the hotels are helpful and friendly. [Person1]:  Well, that's good. And did they buy much while they were there? [Person2]:  No, they advised us not to buy clothes. They're much more expensive than in the states. But they told me you could get gold jewelry for very little.
[Person1]:  Queen's Theatre, can I help you? [Person2]:  Yes. Do you have 2 tickets for the show this Saturday? [Person1]:  Well, all the tickets have been sold out, but we still have a few for Wednesday evening and Tuesday afternoon. [Person2]:  Wednesday evening is OK. Have you got 2 near the front? [Person1]:  Let me see. Just 2 tickets near the back. [Person2]:  How much are they? [Person1]:  They are $8 each. [Person2]:  OK. I'll take them.
[Person1]:  Compared with the yellow one, you look more beautiful in this white skirt. [Person2]:  Thank you. I like the white one better. But how much will you charge me? [Person1]:  It costs $100, but I'd like to take off 30%, and that's it.
[Person1]:  IBA, Jane speaking. How can I help you? [Person2]:  Hello. I'd like to speak to someone regarding my card. [Person1]:  Sorry, I'm not quite sure if I understand. In what way, Sir? Has your card been stolen? [Person2]:  No, no. Nothing at all like that. It's just that I applied for a credit card with you a while ago, my application was accepted, but I'm still waiting for my card. [Person1]:  Oh, I see, Sir. Well, it does take 5 working days to issue and post the card. [Person2]:  Yes, my application was accepted last Friday. Now it's Wednesday, that's more than 5 days. [Person1]:  Sorry, Sir, but it's 5 working days. This does not include weekends, so your card should be with you later this week. [Person2]:  Of course! How silly of me! Yes, 5 working days would mean this Friday, at the earliest. I see. I'm sorry to trouble you. [Person1]:  It's no trouble at all, Sir. Is there anything else I can help you with today? [Person2]:  Nothing, thanks. I again apologise for the misunderstanding, bye for now.
[Person1]:  How may I help you? [Person2]:  I ' m having a problem. [Person1]:  What problem are you having? [Person2]:  There have been charges made on my debit card that I didn ' t make. [Person1]:  Do you have the statement for your card? [Person2]:  Here it is. [Person1]:  What are the charges you ' re referring to? [Person2]:  The last four charges on the page. [Person1]:  I ' m afraid we ' re going to have to investigate these charges. [Person2]:  How long will an investigation take? [Person1]:  I honestly don ' t know, but we will freeze payment on these charges. [Person2]:  That sounds absolutely fantastic.
[Person1]:  Are you ready to order now, Sir? [Person2]:  May I have the menu, please? [Person1]:  Yes, here you go. [Person2]:  I'd like to have some local specialties. Would you recommend for me, please? [Person1]:  Sure, the Huanghe carp with sugar and vinegar is famous in our restaurant. [Person2]:  OK. We'll take it. [Person1]:  Anything else? [Person2]:  A fried crisp chicken and an eggplant with chili sauce. [Person1]:  How about drink? [Person2]:  Coffee, only black coffee,
[Person1]:  Bill. Bill! You gotta help me! [Person2]:  What's wrong? Slow down or you are gonna give yourself a heart attack. [Person1]:  Tomorrow is Christmas and I haven't bought my mom anything! I'm such a bad son! [Person2]:  Take it easy! Let's go to the mall, window shop a little and see if there is anything she might like. [Person1]:  That's just it! I don't know what to get her! Last year I got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small! I suck at getting presents for people. [Person2]:  That's where you're making a big mistake! You can't just guess peoples'likes or sizes! Especially with clothes or jewelry. On top of that, I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her. At the same time you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like! [Person1]:  Yeah, you're right. When it comes down to it, I can be pretty tacky. [Person2]:  Yeah, tell me about it. I know! Your mom is trying to learn Spanish, right? Why don't you get her a gift certificate for this great website I saw called SpanishPod. [Person1]:  Now that's a great idea!
[Person1]:  Why do you choose our company to apply for a job? [Person2]:  I wish to have a job in which I can make good use of my strengths and have further improvement. And your company meets all my requirements. [Person1]:  Have you got a clear idea about our company? [Person2]:  Yes, I have purposefully done some homework in advance. [Person1]:  Have you tried other companies? [Person2]:  Actually, I have applied to several companies recently. But I am most satisfied with your company. [Person1]:  Will you take a job which is not in line with your major? [Person2]:  Admittedly, I hope it is a job in line with my specialty. But I will make the best effort to do the job whatever is assigned to me. [Person1]:  How long would you work here if you were admitted? [Person2]:  I would continue to work in the company as long as the job suits me well. [Person1]:  Do you expect a high salary? [Person2]:  In my mind, salary is not the most important thing.
[Person1]:  I really hate to say this, but don't go away mad, just go away. [Person2]:  I knew this would happen some day. [Person1]:  Then, why didn't you try to prevent it in the beginning? [Person2]:  Well. It's not all my fault, Anna. You are responsible, too. [Person1]:  I don't want to argue anymore. Please get out of my life! [Person2]:  I think we can still talk. [Person1]:  No way! Please don't follow me around. [Person2]:  Talk it easy, Anna. You really don't hate me. do you? [Person1]:  Yes, I do. Leave me alone!
[Person1]:  Darling, I have news for you. Bobby and his wife, Evelyn, are going to have a baby soon. [Person2]:  Really? I thought his wife couldn't have a baby. [Person1]:  Actually they're expecting the baby to come on my birthday. [Person2]:  Oh, what a coincidence! I bet Bobby must be very happy about it. He likes children and always wants a child of his own. [Person1]:  In fact, they're both very excited about the coming baby. Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like, since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese. [Person2]:  Oh, right. Now I know why they would want to see our boy. It's hard to imagine the wonder! Are they expecting a boy or a girl? [Person1]:  It's still a mystery. Because Evelyn is only three-month pregnant. But she begins to take her maternity leave now. [Person2]:  Oh! You mean she doesn't have to work now? It's hard for young parents not to overreact, isn't it?
[Person1]:  Who is this on the water buffalo? [Person2]:  That's my grand-father. He was a farmer. When he was young, he had to take the water buffalo to graze in the field. [Person1]:  Oh yes, that was the best job in most farm families. That's where many of them learned to play the flute. [Person2]:  My grandfather did that too. He used the time to study instead. [Person1]:  That's interesting. Go on! [Person2]:  My grand grandfather was a merchant who ran a small business. He couldn't afford to send my grand father to school. [Person1]:  So he became a self-taught man? [Person2]:  Right. Later he was a soldier and a fireman in the village. When he was middle aged, he became a great man, quite famous. [Person1]:  In what field? [Person2]:  As a leader of police officers in charge of the whole country. [Person1]:  Is he still in that that type of work. [Person2]:  No. He retired from that. He is a senator now. [Person1]:  Would you want to be a senator? [Person2]:  Well, maybe when I get old. But first I'll be a lawyer.
[Person1]:  Hi, Bob. Can I have the book back I lent to you last month? [Person2]:  Oh! I forgot all about it. Of course you can have it back, John. I'm sorry about the delay. [Person1]:  Well, it doesn't matter. I almost forgot it too if it is not for Peter who asked me about it this coming.
[Person1]:  Are you an outgoing person, or more reserved? [Person2]:  I wouldn't call myself outgoing. I used to be very shy when I was little, and it seems that I get a little more relaxed a-round people year after year, and have more fun in groups. [Person1]:  Are you more of a follower or a leader? [Person2]:  I don't try to get in front of people and lead them, particularly. I'd rather cooperate with everybody else, and get the job done by working together. [Person1]:  What basic principles do you apply to your life? [Person2]:  Not to put off till tomorrow what you can do today. I've found out that time and money get away very easily, you think you have them, and they're gone! Putting things off just makes it worse later, so even if it's hard at the time, I try to get things done that day and not let them go.
[Person1]:  Mr. Drake, I'm pleased to do business with your company. [Person2]:  We're glad to be able to offer our services to your business, Mrs. Wayne. [Person1]:  Your company is very well respected. About how long have you been in business? [Person2]:  Almost twenty years. We were the first total PR services company of our kind in California. [Person1]:  And this is your company's head office? [Person2]:  Well, yes, but now we have six offices in California alone. [Person1]:  That's wonderful. Isn't your company part of ARE Corporation? [Person2]:  That's right. We are their sole PR sector business. [Person1]:  That's not bad. How long have you been in PR? [Person2]:  Not long actually. So I'm sure I will learn a lot from our cooperation.
[Person1]:  I want to buy some jewellery. [Person2]:  What kind of jewellery do you like to have? [Person1]:  I should like to look at some bracelets. [Person2]:  May I show you gold ones or jade ones? [Person1]:  Jade ones. [Person2]:  OK, here they are. [Person1]:  What's the price for this one? [Person2]:  Eight hundred yuan. [Person1]:  How about seven hundred yuan? [Person2]:  I'm sorry, we only sell at fixed prices. [Person1]:  OK. I'll take it.
[Person1]:  So Mr. Brown, this is your bed, and as you can see, there are three other beds in the ward. Have you got everything you need? [Person2]:  Yes, nurse, I think so. I followed the hospital's advice, and I've only brought a few belongings with me. [Person1]:  Good, you can see the reasons why we ask you to do that, the cupboard is really very small. [Person2]:  Yes, of course. They are only afternoon from 2 [Person1]:  Yes. We start pretty early. We wake you at 6 o'clock and breakfast is at 8 o'clock, lunch is at noon, there is tea at 3 [Person2]:  Oh, that's very different from what I have been used to. You'd better tell me the rest of the rules here. [Person1]:  Yes. Well, you can see the no smoking sign, we don't allow smoking in the wards, and the same goes for alcohol. However, if you do need to smoke, there are special lounges. [Person2]:  Oh, I don't smoke, so it doesn't affect me. [Person1]:  Good.
[Person1]:  Did you hear what happened in the Scott case? Some of the sensitive material were leaked to the press. Now every newspapers is all over it.  [Person2]:  Oh. . . I bet the firm is fuming. Do they know who spilled the beans?  [Person1]:  I'm sure they have their suspicions; there were only a few of the senior level lawers who were privy to the case details.  [Person2]:  What kind of repercussions will there be for the people who are held responsible?  [Person1]:  I'm sure there'll be canned! And there also might be some legal consequences.  [Person2]:  Why would the person who told have problems with the law?  [Person1]:  Because whoever let the cat out of the bag was breaking client confidentiality.  [Person2]:  I didn't think about that. That's pretty serious. Are there investigators working on finding out who it was?  [Person1]:  I'm sure management is on top of it. 
[Person1]:  Oh god! Look at the mess. Somebody's broken in. The back door's open. [Person2]:  They mustn't have got in that way. I locked it. [Person1]:  What about the windows? The bathroom window is open. Surely they must have climbed through that. [Person2]:  Yeah. Wow, the television is gone. [Person1]:  They must have had a car or a truck. [Person2]:  My camera's here, but the radio's gone. Nothing else has been stolen. All your jeweler is here, but our daughter's toy is broken. [Person1]:  Thank goodness. They can't have been here long. [Person2]:  No, I think we must have disturbed them. They must have heard us coming and got out of the bathroom window quickly. [Person1]:  Yes, well, hurry up. We'd better phone the police.
[Person1]:  Good morning, Uncle Smith. [Person2]:  Good morning, Cathy. [Person1]:  I want to have a dinner party to celebrate my birthday. Would you come? [Person2]:  I'd love to, Cathy. What time? [Person1]:  Next weekend, on Saturday. [Person2]:  Saturday do you say? [Person1]:  If that's all right with you. [Person2]:  I'm afraid I'm busy then. I've already had plans. [Person1]:  What about Sunday? [Person2]:  I'm sure it will be all fight. [Person1]:  Good, you'd better around 6
[Person1]:  Hi, Michael, how's it going?  [Person2]:  Well, things are all right.  [Person1]:  I heard you got a new roommate. What's he like?  [Person2]:  Yeah, Bob moved in last week. He is a nice guy and so far everything is cool except this girlfriend.  [Person1]:  Oh? What's wrong with his girlfriend?  [Person2]:  She came over last weekend. She is a nice girl but there's something about her voice that really creeps me out. I tried to smile and be polite, but the whole time all I could think was 'what's wrong with your voice? '  [Person1]:  Well, I guess it might take some time to get used to.  [Person2]:  I doubt it. Last time was an oral train wreck. Listening to her talk is like chewing tin foil.  [Person1]:  Oh come on, it's not that bad.  [Person2]:  No, it's so much worse. And tonight they invited me out to dinner. I really have no idea how I'm going to pull it off.  [Person1]:  Rough. Maybe you can do the most of the talking.  [Person2]:  That's the plan.  [Person1]:  Good luck. 
[Person1]:  Professor Hopkins, may I have a word with you? [Person2]:  Sure, Meg. What's up? [Person1]:  I gotta see for my report. I am wondering what I have done wrong. You know I have put a lot of time and energy to the report. [Person2]:  Well, Meg. I understand you have made much effort on their report. Maybe that's why you are 2 days late to hand in the report. The due date is September third. [Person1]:  Yes, professor. I am sorry about that. [Person2]:  And this report is about the success of the Starbucks Coffee. In your report you have mentioned the company's management, selection of stores and service, but I am surprised that you didn't mention anything about its coffee. It's a coffee shop, Meg! Isn't the taste of its coffee the most important thing to its success? [Person1]:  Yeah, I guess I have made a mistake by leaving it out. [Person2]:  And figures are important too. You also need to add an actual figure, such as the monthly sales. [Person1]:  You are quite right, professor. [Person2]:  And why not do more research? Look for some figures and write the report again. [Person1]:  Are you giving me another chance, professor? [Person2]:  Seems like I am.
[Person1]:  What are you going to do tonight? [Person2]:  Oh, I'm going to stay at home and study. My final exam is coming up next week. [Person1]:  Is it going to be difficult? [Person2]:  It will be harder than the mid-term exam. I'm sure. [Person1]:  Was the mid-term exam difficult? [Person2]:  It was the most difficult exam that I'd ever had. [Person1]:  Then maybe this one will be easier. [Person2]:  Well. I'm going to spend more time studying for it than I did for the mid-term exam. [Person1]:  What are you going to do after the exam? [Person2]:  I don't know. Maybe I'll look for a better job. [Person1]:  What's the matter with this job? [Person2]:  It isn't the worst job in the world. But it isn't the best job, either. [Person1]:  Do you want to work for a bigger company? [Person2]:  I want to get ahead. I want to make more money.
[Person1]:  May I help you, sir?  [Person2]:  Yes, please. I'd like to buy a gift for my younger brother. He's going to take a trip to South America.  [Person1]:  By air or by sea?  [Person2]:  By air. So my gift should be quite light. What can you suggest?  [Person1]:  How about this wallet? It's made of fine leather.  [Person2]:  My sister already gave him one. I like something unusual.  [Person1]:  This gift is the best for a man who has everything.  [Person2]:  Oh, a nice handkerchief. That's a great idea. I'll take it. 
[Person1]:  Hey Nick, what are you up to? [Person2]:  Not much, just heading over to the shooting range. You wanna come? [Person1]:  Seriously? You mean to fire a real weapon? I don ' t know man. [Person2]:  Yeah, it will be fun! I have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot. I also have a revolver that ' s really fun too! They have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve your aim. [Person1]:  Yeah that would be cool! Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun! Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile! Or what about a flame thrower! [Person2]:  Whoa, take it easy there Rambo. Don ' t get carried away. These weapons are not toys, and you must first learn how to handle them properly. There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe. For example, never handle a weapon that you haven ' t inspected yourself. Always make sure there isn ' t anything in the chamber, and never put your finger on the trigger unless you are ready to shoot! [Person1]:  Wow, I didn ' t know! It always looks so cool and easy in the movies! [Person2]:  The reality is different you know, running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies! So are you ready? [Person1]:  Let ' s do it!
[Person1]:  I'm taking a date to a restaurant, so could you please direct me to a good one? [Person2]:  But of course! How much are you thinking of spending on dinner? [Person1]:  She deserves nothing but the best, of course. [Person2]:  In that case, I would suggest our own hotel restaurant. The chef, the food, and the service are outstanding. [Person1]:  I promised her I would take her out to a restaurant. Do you have another one in mind? [Person2]:  You can always go to Gramercy Tavern. It's quite popular, despite its expensive entrees. [Person1]:  Great food and lots of patrons? What more could I want? Please reserve a table for me. [Person2]:  Yes, sir. You're going to have a great time.
[Person1]:  I have some good news for you. We've decided we'd like to send you to Shanghai on a business trip this weekend. [Person2]:  oh. [Person1]:  don't you think that it'd be a good thing for you to get out of the office for a couple of days? [Person2]:  sure. [Person1]:  I thought you'd be a bit more excited about this. Everything will be paid for and I'll send my assistant with you to take care of everything for you. All you have to do it get on the train tonight a [Person2]:  the train? Will I be flying back then? [Person1]:  oh, no. We've brought your return ticket for you. I think you'll find it comfortable. [Person2]:  will the train be very crowded? [Person1]:  oh no. the train hasn't been crowded at all recently. Besides, you're in first-class, so you'll be fine. [Person2]:  when is the first meeting then? [Person1]:  they've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9 [Person2]:  where will I be staying? [Person1]:  we've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings, so you won't need to deal much with the transportation system. [Person2]:  that's very sensible. Would it be alright if I left early today to prepare for the trip? [Person1]:  that's not a problem. Have a nap if you can. You don't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip.
[Person1]:  I've got some bad news about the bike you lent me. [Person2]:  What's that? [Person1]:  I fell on the way to school, and your bike got scratched. I'm really sorry. [Person2]:  Don't worry about it. It's not new, it already has a few scratches. Did you get hurt? [Person1]:  No, thank you. [Person2]:  That's the most important thing. [Person1]:  It's kind of you to say. I feel a little stupid. [Person2]:  Forget about it. [Person1]:  When you lent me the bike, it looked brand new, almost anyway. [Person2]:  Maybe, but really I have fallen a couple of times and it's been hit once or twice as well. [Person1]:  I appreciate that, thank you.
[Person1]:  Would you like to go skating with me this afternoon? [Person2]:  Oh, I'd love to. But we're going to clean our dormitory. I can't be absent. [Person1]:  Maybe another time. People say that boys'dormitories are in a mess, is it true? [Person2]:  In fact, our dormitory is much worse than they can be described. [Person1]:  It's hard for me to imagine. How can you stand that? [Person2]:  You'll get used to it gradually. [Person1]:  Oh my God, don't you know that such living environment is not healthy? [Person2]:  Yes, we do. That's why we have a cleaning every three months. [Person1]:  Three months? Incredible!
[Person1]:  So, tell me about you new house. How is it different to your old one? [Person2]:  Well, first of all, it's much bigger. It has the same number of rooms, but each room is larger. We also have a larger garden, which our dog loves, of course! [Person1]:  So, it's a three-bedrooms detached house? [Person2]:  Yes. One bedroom is for my wife and I. there's another for our daughter. My wife wants to use the third one as a guest room, but I'd like to make it into a study. Our daughter is also keen on making it a study, so that's probably what will happen. [Person1]:  What's the kitchen like? I know both you and your wife like to cook. [Person2]:  That's one of the main reason we chose that particular house. The kitchen and dining room are together. It's really large. [Person1]:  Are the rooms nice and bright? [Person2]:  Yes, they are. That's very important to us. We like to live in a home with plenty of natural light. Each room has large windows. [Person1]:  Do you have a balcony? [Person2]:  No, we don't. We wish we had one. That's the only thing we wanted, but don't have. The area is very nice and the neighbours seem friendly. [Person1]:  You're right on the edge of the city, aren't you? There can't be much noise or traffic there. Is it easy to get into city centre? [Person2]:  It's a very quiet neighbourhood. There's some traffic, but not much. It's not very difficult to get to the city centre, but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or you'll get lost. So when are you going to drop by?
[Person1]:  Good morning. Miss Lee. My name is Alex Jones. I'm the new assistant in the office. [Person2]:  Welcome and nice to meet you. I heard you were coming today. Is today your first day here in the company? [Person1]:  Yes, I'm looking forward to meeting everybody and getting started on my new job. [Person2]:  First day is often exciting, isn't it? Here, let me show you to your desk. You can have this computer and telephone and share the copy machine with us in the office. How do you like it? [Person1]:  This is wonderful. Thank you for doing all this for me, Miss Lee. [Person2]:  You are welcome. And, please call me Betty.
[Person1]:  So Kim, have you ever had anything stolen?  [Person2]:  Stolen? No, why?  [Person1]:  My uncle just had his motorcycle stolen a few nights ago. I was just thinking about how clever criminals are these days.  [Person2]:  Criminals are clever? They're only successful when people are careless.  [Person1]:  I don't know. The ones who stole my uncle's motorcycle were pretty good.  [Person2]:  If your uncle had an alarm system, then it wouldn't have happened.  [Person1]:  He did. It was one of the best ones available. But that didn't stop them from disabling it. And on a crowded street too.  [Person2]:  Didn't anyone stop them?  [Person1]:  You would think that people would be smart enough to stop something like that. No one knew his motorcycle was being stolen. The thieves came in a truck and convinced everybody that my uncle was parked illegally and they were there to tow it away.  [Person2]:  Wow, they were good. I guess criminals aren't that dumb after all.  [Person1]:  That's not the end. They were so good that they convinced a bystander to help them lift the motorcycle and put it in the truck. 
[Person1]:  I call this meeting to order. Thank you all in attendance today, I know it's a busy day for you all. We have a lot of material to cover today. Did everyone get an agenda? [Person2]:  I need a copy of the agenda. Also, may I suggest something? I know we have many points to review today, but would it be possible to limit our meeting time to finish before four o'clock? Many of us still have a mountain of work to do before the day's end. [Person1]:  We should be able to finish everything up before then. Let's run through the major points first, and see where we're at. The first matter of business is to approve the minutes of our last meeting. [Person2]:  I propose we accept the minutes. [Person1]:  Good. Do I have a second? [Person2]:  I second. [Person1]:  motion carried. Now, next on our agenda is our budget review. Margaret, can you please fill us in on where the budget review stands? [Person2]:  I gave everyone a copy of the manual last week. We've had the review board going over everything, and they have come up with a final review. Here's a copy for everyone, and if you have any questions, you can talk to me after the meeting. Basically, the budget review has been completed, with maybe a few polishing details left. [Person1]:  What kind of action is required? [Person2]:  If everyone could take a look at the final review handout, if there're any objections or corrections, let me know. Next week, we can cast the final approval.
[Person1]:  I want to lose some weight! [Person2]:  So do I! [Person1]:  I have a yoga class tomorrow. Do you want to come with me? [Person2]:  No, it's too expensive for me. I've decided to take some exercises on my own. [Person1]:  What are you going to do? [Person2]:  Run around the track. In the morning I run for an hour, and in the afternoon I run around the building. [Person1]:  Good, I am sure it will work if you can persist. [Person2]:  I hope so. Would you like to join me? [Person1]:  Sounds good!
[Person1]:  Thank you all for coming to our monthly staff correlation meeting. Today we have a lot of new things to introduce to you all, there will be a lot of changes in company policy to accommodate better employee welfare. [Person2]:  Employee welfare? What all does that include? [Person1]:  In the past, our welfare program has consisted of benefits packages only, meaning partial health insurance coverage and retirement plan. But we hope to boost morale by increasing incentives and adding additional welfare considerations. [Person2]:  What kind of considerations are we talking about? [Person1]:  It is proposed that from now on, employees will be given 10 paid sick days, in addition to their 2 week vacation periods. They will also be encouraged to maintain proper physical health with a company sponsored aerobics class on Friday nights. We have also consulted with the human resource department and have hired a new liaison between management and employees. Let's all welcome Ms. Michelle Cain to our team as our company's ombudsman. [Person2]:  Our company now has n ombudsman? [Person1]:  Yes, that's right. From now on, whenever you have a question or concern regarding anything that happens during the work day, Ms. Cain will be your advocate. If you believe there is anything inappropriate or unfair in the management practices, the ombudsman will be the first person you seek. Her job is to have your best interest at heart.
[Person1]:  I received an eviction notice from you, and I don't understand what it means. [Person2]:  Well, you are behind in your rent ; it's a 30 - day notice to vacate. [Person1]:  You can't make me move just for being late with my rent. [Person2]:  You have been late with your rent several times now. I am filing suit for back rent to protect myself. [Person1]:  Are you throwing me out? [Person2]:  This notice is to let you know that you will be evicted by a sheriff if you don't make good on your rent. [Person1]:  If I catch up on my rent, can I stay? [Person2]:  You can stay if you catch up and stay caught up. Otherwise, I will find another renter. [Person1]:  I will go get the money right now. [Person2]:  Thank you. Please make sure that you pay with cash or a cashier's check.
[Person1]:  Morrie, what is an AHT? [Person2]:  Well, AHT stands for animal health technician. I graduated from California's first AHT class at Pures College. Some of us may work in the countryside, taking care of cattle, horses or sheep. Some may work in research labs. But most of us work in pet hospitals. [Person1]:  I know that you work in a pet hospital. What do you do there? [Person2]:  We run blood and other tests, give shots and prepare medicine. We also cut nails, clean teeth, give bath and clean the cages. We help keep the clinic running smoothly, making sure there is enough medicine and equipment. [Person1]:  Indeed, you have so much to do. Doctor Blake told me that he couldn't have done so much without you.
[Person1]:  So tell me a little more about yourself, Sharon. [Person2]:  Well, when I graduated from drama school, I tried to get a job as an actress in Hollywood. [Person1]:  Really? [Person2]:  Yeah, but I didn't get any parts. Two years later, I finally got a job with Universal Studios. [Person1]:  So you finally got to be an actress? [Person2]:  No, I'm a tour guide at the studio!But while I'm on the job, I get to see a lot of stars!
[Person1]:  your mp3 looks so cool. Where did you get it?  [Person2]:  I bought it online.  [Person1]:  really? Do you often shop online?  [Person2]:  yes. I buy most of my daily necessities online.  [Person1]:  I've never tried E-shopping. Is it better than shopping at an actual store?  [Person2]:  yes, much better. You can log in a website, browse through many items and categories comfortably at home, order the goods, pay by credit or debit card, and the goods will be delivered to your home.  [Person1]:  sounds good, and I don't have to queue up at the cashier.  [Person2]:  and you can still go 'window shopping' just like in a real shopping mall.  [Person1]:  well, are there any other advantages?  [Person2]:  yes, most of the shops are closed at 22 or even earlier, but the internet operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and can be accessed anywhere.  [Person1]:  are there many choices of online shopping?  [Person2]:  sure. You can buy almost anything you can think of.  [Person1]:  perhaps I should have a try. 
[Person1]:  Ah, Mary. What did you have to go and do that for? [Person2]:  Do what? [Person1]:  You know what I am talking about. Why did you go and tell Mrs. Jones how much money I'm going to make? Now she will go and tell the whole world. [Person2]:  I'm sorry, Frank. [Person1]:  Yeah, but you know she talks to everybody and their brothers. [Person2]:  Well, I apologize. I guess I wasn't thinking. I got all excited. [Person1]:  Oh, well. It's done now. I guess it doesn't matter that much, anyway. They will know in the end. Everyone in this town got a big nose. [Person2]:  You know it is really a lot of money for a first job.
[Person1]:  Sir is this the right subway for Chinatown? [Person2]:  Yes, you get off at Brown Street, cross it to reach Green Street, walk along Green Street and turn into Canal Street at the first crossing. Chinatown is right there. [Person1]:  Shall I take the expresser local train? [Person2]:  Take the express, the price is the same, but it saves you a lot of time. The local train stops at every station. [Person1]:  How much is the fair? [Person2]:  $1 for the entire line. You should pay 30 cents to get off here.
[Person1]:  Let's workout the schedule for your stay here, Mister Smith. [Person2]:  Alright, I will stay here for 3 days and will fly back the day after tomorrow. [Person1]:  So we'll get down to business today. We're going to visit the showroom this morning and you could find out about the product that you're interested in. [Person2]:  Alright, I'd also like to visit your factory to see your workshop. [Person1]:  We're planning so. How about this afternoon? [Person2]:  OK, no problem. [Person1]:  We'll discuss our contract tomorrow. [Person2]:  Yes, certainly. Hopefully we'll reach an agreement that satisfies us. [Person1]:  That'll be great. The day after tomorrow I'll take you on a tour of the city in the morning, so you could do some shopping. [Person2]:  That's fine and I'll leave in the afternoon. [Person1]:  What do you think of the arrangements? [Person2]:  Sounds perfect. Thank you.
[Person1]:  Tom, can you get the vegetables out of the fridge, please? [Person2]:  Lettuce and carrots? [Person1]:  We need carrots, but not lettuce. And can you see the peppers? [Person2]:  Yes. [Person1]:  Two of those as well. We'll cut them into small pieces. [Person2]:  Fine. Shall I turn the cooker on? [Person1]:  Yes, nice and hot, please. [Person2]:  190 degrees? [Person1]:  Put it at 220 for now, and then we can change it to 200 later. [Person2]:  OK, the vegetables are ready? [Person1]:  Good. We can roast them together with the fish. [Person2]:  How long will it take? [Person1]:  Will cook it hot for 15 minutes, and then 25 minutes at a lower temperature. So in 40 minutes, it'll be ready. [Person2]:  Great. I'm going to watch TV for a few minutes. [Person1]:  Actually, can you do this little bit of washing up? I'm going to make a dessert. [Person2]:  OK.
[Person1]:  We want to order some of these products. [Person2]:  Mr. Thomas, this is a standard size. [Person1]:  Can you supply us right away? [Person2]:  Yes, we have plenty on hand right now. [Person1]:  Good, we'll take 500 suits. [Person2]:  OK, thanks for the order.
[Person1]:  I wish the politicians would quit digging up dirt about each other's past. [Person2]:  I know. It really makes a mess of the whole election process. [Person1]:  And it takes up all the news. [Person2]:  The problem is that there always a large number of people who eat that kind of stuff up. [Person1]:  It's so small. The fact that there is public interest, doesn't say much for us as the public. [Person2]:  Have you ever listened to AM radio? It's quite a different experience than the traditional news stations on TV and FM radio. [Person1]:  I don't remember the last time I listened to AM radio. [Person2]:  Another place you can get real insight is European papers. You can get them on-line.
[Person1]:  Out of every movie that you've seen, which one is your favorite? [Person2]:  I'm going to have to say that Superbad is the best movie ever. [Person1]:  You think so, how come? [Person2]:  Well, Superbad is super funny. [Person1]:  You're not lying, I found that movie absolutely hilarious. [Person2]:  I didn't know that you saw Superbad before. [Person1]:  I made sure to be in line to see it the first day it came out. [Person2]:  I couldn't keep from laughing throughout the whole movie. [Person1]:  I was laughing hysterically the whole time ; my stomach muscles hurt afterwards. [Person2]:  That's exactly how I felt. [Person1]:  I got the movie when it came out on DVD, do you want to come over? [Person2]:  I would love to.
[Person1]:  What do you think of smoking? [Person2]:  It's harmful. Not only for yourself but for others. [Person1]:  What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking? [Person2]:  Stop producing cigarettes. [Person1]:  But that'll affect the national economy. [Person2]:  That's right. But I don't think there are better ways. [Person1]:  How about printing a warning on each cigarette packet? [Person2]:  Maybe it can take effect.
[Person1]:  What's your little caper? Come home so late! We are all worried about you. [Person2]:  Oh, I am terribly sorry. But I was so captivated with the singer at the subway exit. So I forgot the time. [Person1]:  Singing? At the subway exit? Oh, it sounds like someone needs some money. [Person2]:  Oh, no, the guy was a musician who just sang. He played the guitar and sang so many cool pop songs. Many people were drawn to his music and there was no hat on the floor. He sang for appreciation, but not for money. [Person1]:  It is just pop song, you could have sung there too if you want it. [Person2]:  Oh, no, it was a kind of pop art. I like it but I couldn't do it that well. [Person1]:  Honey, just do it next time. Have you heard of the real art in the subway station in Russia? [Person2]:  No, but tell me some. I am interested. [Person1]:  Many oil painting exhibitions are there. That is a kind of Museum Exhibition. [Person2]:  Are there many people there? Do you think people actually like them? [Person1]:  I am sure you will. There are some works, and some students who major in painting interpret the meaning for visitors. And people can enjoy the paintings while waiting for the train. [Person2]:  But I still prefer the pop music in the subway. [Person1]:  Both the pop music and the oil painting are arts, but with different aesthetic values. [Person2]:  Dad, you talk well, but can you appreciate that kind of art? [Person1]:  Not well enough, but I'm learning.
[Person1]:  Good morning, Miss. [Person2]:  Morning. Can I help you? [Person1]:  Yes, I'd like to know how to use the library. You know, I'm a new student here. [Person2]:  All you need is your student identification card to check out books. [Person1]:  Yes. Here's my identification. [Person2]:  That's all you need. [Person1]:  Thank you very much. By the way, how many books am I allowed to check out? [Person2]:  You can check out two books at a time. But you can't check out newspapers, magazines and periodicals ; they have to be read within library. [Person1]:  How long can I keep the books? [Person2]:  For two weeks. After that you must renew the books if you wish to keep them longer. [Person1]:  I want a book on physics. Could you show me where I can find it? [Person2]:  Yes, over there to your left.
[Person1]:  This skirt is too tight. I would like to return it please. Do I need to go to the customer's service desk? [Person2]:  I can help you with that. Do you still have your receipt? [Person1]:  No, I receive this as a birthday present, but the price tag is still on the skirt though. Will that be OK? [Person2]:  Oh, yes, that will help me a lot. [Person1]:  Do you have any more skirts in this style? I would like to find a size larger. [Person2]:  I'm sorry. I think we're out of this skirt in this color. Do you want me to call another one of our store to see if it's available there? [Person1]:  No, that's all right. I'll just look for something else. [Person2]:  Well, your refund total is 50 dollars.
[Person1]:  I would like to place an order. [Person2]:  Alright, Ma'am. What items would you like to order today? [Person1]:  I have your catalog here. Do you want me to tell you the item numbers, or the names? [Person2]:  You may tell me both, Ma'am. [Person1]:  Alright. I want to order the satin sheets on page 28. [Person2]:  The Merriman satin sheets? [Person1]:  Yes, that's right. [Person2]:  And what size would you like? [Person1]:  I need one full set of sheets in King-size. [Person2]:  Alright, Ma'am. And what color did you want? [Person1]:  Ivory, please [Person2]:  So that is product number MS2119, Size [Person1]:  Yes, I think so. Can I ask you something? [Person2]:  Certainly. [Person1]:  I'm a foreigner here. My English isn't perfect. Can you tell me what satin is? [Person2]:  Satin is like silk, Ma'am. It feels like silk. But it's a different material. [Person1]:  I see. That's what I thought. [Person2]:  Anything else today? [Person1]:  No, I just need the sheets. [Person2]:  Alright. With shipping charges, your total will be 68 dollars. Will you be paying with credit? [Person1]:  Yes. [Person2]:  Visa, Master Card, or American Express? [Person1]:  Visa. [Person2]:  Card number? [Person1]:  8825 1127 4235 9869. [Person2]:  Expiration date? [Person1]:  July, 2006. [Person2]:  All right, Ma'am. I will run that charge for you. And then I will get your address in a moment [Person1]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  When should I come for work in the morning? [Person2]:  Generally speaking, you are supposed to come at 9 [Person1]:  When does the job start in the afternoon? [Person2]:  You should start from 1
[Person1]:  I am sorry, but I can't find the book you lent me. [Person2]:  That's OK. [Person1]:  I really feel bad about it. Let me buy you a new one. [Person2]:  No. Don't be silly. I wouldn't dream of letting you do that.
[Person1]:  Good morning. This is Peter Brown of IMA computers. What can I do for you? [Person2]:  Hello. I'd like to order some computer monitors. [Person1]:  Yes. Which ones? [Person2]:  The order number is C106. [Person1]:  How many do you need? [Person2]:  Three hundred, please. [Person1]:  One moment. Yes, we can supply them. [Person2]:  Could you send them by July 21st, please? [Person1]:  Certainly. [Person2]:  Good, thanks. [Person1]:  Thank you. Good-bye. [Person2]:  Good-bye.
[Person1]:  I've just finished reading Steve's list of ways of motivating employees to work more efficiently. I think they're out of touch with reality. [Person2]:  You just took the words out of my mouth. Let's try to persuade the others to see things our way.
[Person1]:  Welcome back! I didn't see you in physics class last Thursday. [Person2]:  I was absent myself that day. I went on a trip to New York, I just came back last night. [Person1]:  New York! What a city! I'm sure you had lots of fun there. [Person2]:  No, not really. I was busy doing business. It's very hot there, too. [Person1]:  Well, did you enjoy the trip? I have never been to New York. I'd like to go there someday. [Person2]:  Yeah, it was OK. I went to see the Statue of Liberty and that made the trip interesting. Try to make it during the spring or autumn when the weather is nice.
[Person1]:  Hey. Don't worry. Uh, my brother will meet you at the airport. Sorry, but I have to work that day. [Person2]:  So, you can't come to get me? [Person1]:  No, uh, sorry. [Person2]:  Uh, well, um, what does your brother look like? [Person1]:  Well, he's fairly tall, he has short light brown hair, and he's pretty thin. He's certainly not a body builder or pro wrestler. [Person2]:  Okay. Um, what else? [Person1]:  Oh, and he usually wears a white baseball cap with crazy looking red shoes. I mean, you can't miss him. [Person2]:  Alright. So, I'm looking for some tall crazy looking guy with wild red shoes who's ready to play baseball? [Person1]:  Exactly. [Person2]:  And what's his name? [Person1]:  Well, uh, Mike, Michael. He goes by either one. [Person2]:  Alright. [Person1]:  Alright. Bye. [Person2]:  I Hope he shows up? [Person1]:  Okay, now, I'll call him. [Person2]:  Alright, bye. [Person1]:  Bye.
[Person1]:  Hi, Jenny. We will have our midterm exams next month. I plan to look for some important books and study at the library. Do you want to join me? [Person2]:  Sure. I need to return some books. They are due today. Besides, I can also read some weekly publications, magazines and newspapers. [Person1]:  Great. We can go to the swimming pool in the gymnasium after that. [Person2]:  Sounds a good idea. Summer is approaching. Today's temperature has reached 35 degree Centigrade. Are you good at swimming? [Person1]:  Well, that's a good question. I haven't swum for almost two years. I think I need more practice. [Person2]:  Oh, it's almost 9. I need to hurry. I am running late now. See you after class at the gate of the library then. Bye! [Person1]:  See you then.
[Person1]:  Welcome to tonight's Legendary Lives. I'm Shirley Morgan. Tonight, we are quite honored to invite David Hopkins, a well known chef with 30 years of cooking experience. Last year, his new book, Secrets in the Kitchen got on a New York Times best seller list for 6 months. Welcome to our program, David. [Person2]:  Hello, Shirley, it's a pleasure to be here. [Person1]:  David, I can't wait to see you uncovered a formulas for dishes. Exploring the How's and why's of cooking. Before that, may I ask you a question? What's the difference between a chef and a cook? [Person2]:  I think cooks generally work at entry level jobs. They work at different places in the kitchen and follow recipes. In contrast, chefs have special training and understand better which food goes well together, so they can invent new recipes. [Person1]:  I see, a chef is the cook, who has completed a professional course while a cook it's basically any person who cooks food. By the way, how do you become a chef? [Person2]:  I am trained. 95% is about professional training and the other 5% is about talent. [Person1]:  Would you mind describing us a day of a chef? We're so curious about that. [Person2]:  Nothing special, I generally go to work 2 hours before service starts. The night before, I've written the lists of all the things we need to prepare the next day. I work in different roles depending on what is needed. [Person1]:  Challenging. How long do you work everyday? [Person2]:  10 to 12 hours a day. [Person1]:  An almost full time job! Do you have any tips for average cooks, like me? [Person2]:  Cooking involves your passion and creativity. Kitchen is never a place to chop vegetables, and have a quick breakfast. It is good to make food that people really enjoy. [Person1]:  I can't agree with you more. Miracles happen in the kitchen. Thanks for joining us, David. [Person2]:  My pleasure.
[Person1]:  Are you ready to visit grandma in Springfield? [Person2]:  Yes. I just have to get the picture that I drew for her. [Person1]:  Great. Let's put it in this box, so it stays nice and flat. [Person2]:  I used the colored pencils that she got me for my birthday to make it, too! She will be happy about that. [Person1]:  Yes, she will. She loves your artwork! I wish I had time to bake a cake. [Person2]:  She would have liked that. You are the best baker, Mom.
[Person1]:  Did you hear what Fred did last night? [Person2]:  No,not yet. What happened to him? [Person1]:  I guess he was a little drunk and he had a fight with his brother. Well, he got so mad that he drove his car straight into the front of a drugstore. [Person2]:  What do you mean? [Person1]:  I mean he drove inside. The front of the store was completely destroyed. I actually saw it just now as I walked by. The car is still inside the store. [Person2]:  I'm afraid Fred is in trouble. Where is he now? [Person1]:  I hear he's in the police station. It's lucky no one was hurt.
[Person1]:  I am looking for a blouse. Can you show me the way, please?  [Person2]:  OK, what style do you want?  [Person1]:  I have no idea. Could you recommend me one?  [Person2]:  What about this one? It fits you.  [Person1]:  Well, the style is quite good, but I think it's too showy. I would like to try on the lighter one.

[Person2]:  I am really sorry too, maybe I can give you a call sometime.
[Person1]:  can I see your passport, please? [Person2]:  is this line for non-residents? [Person1]:  yes it is. Residents can queen up in the lines to my right. [Person2]:  Ok. Here's my passport. [Person1]:  what's the expiration date on your passport? [Person2]:  I think it's soon, maybe in a few months. It was renewed in Beijing, so the new expiry date is on the last page. [Person1]:  I see. Yes, you'll need to renew your passport in a few months. Make sure you don't let it expire while you are in the UK. [Person2]:  I won't. [Person1]:  do you have anything to declare? [Person2]:  no, I don't have anything to declare. [Person1]:  how long will you be staying in the UK? [Person2]:  I'll be here for about a year. [Person1]:  what is the purpose of your stay? [Person2]:  I'll be studying. I'm doing an MBA at Nottingham University. [Person1]:  where will you be staying? [Person2]:  I have a housing contract with the university. I'll be in a dorm room on campus. [Person1]:  how do you plan on paying for your living costs and tuition fees while you are here? [Person2]:  my father has already paid for that in advance. Here are the receipts. [Person1]:  ok. Have a good day. Here's your passport and documents back. [Person2]:  thank you very much.
[Person1]:  This is the first time for me to have a Chinese guest. I hope you like western cooking. [Person2]:  Yes. I like it very much. [Person1]:  Cooking is a hobby with me. I'm always trying to think up new recipes. I hope you like the soup. It's kind of a specialty of mine, so I hope you enjoy it. [Person2]:  It's excellent. [Person1]:  Thank you for your compliment. Won't you try this fish with white sauce? I'm rather round of it. [Person2]:  It's delicious. [Person1]:  What sort of western food do you like best? [Person2]:  I like beefsteak very much. Have you tried Chinese dishes? [Person1]:  I find the Chinese dishes wonderful. [Person2]:  Well, it's getting late. I have to get up early tomorrow. So I must say good night. [Person1]:  It's still early.
[Person1]:  What's taking you so long? [Person2]:  Don't worry. I'm almost finished. [Person1]:  I need you to hurry up. [Person2]:  All right. I'm finished. [Person1]:  I think there's more you need to do. [Person2]:  What do you mean by that? [Person1]:  My hair looks awful. [Person2]:  What don't you like about it? [Person1]:  I just don't like my hair. [Person2]:  I'm sorry that you don't like it. [Person1]:  I won't be paying you for this. [Person2]:  I'm sure we can work something out.
[Person1]:  Front desk, can I help you? [Person2]:  Yes, I need a wake-up call tomorrow at seven thirty. [Person1]:  Sure. Your room number, PLS? [Person2]:  Room 1019. [Person1]:  Room 1019, tomorrow at seven thirty. Ok, we will give you a call in the morning.
[Person1]:  What kind of life do you prefer, city life or country life? [Person2]:  In comparison to city life, the country life is quiet and peaceful. [Person1]:  But it doesn't have all the modern convenience offered by the city. [Person2]:  Yeah, I agree. Every wall has two sides.
[Person1]:  Wow! They've got everything here. All the world's famous brands. Aunt Cindy, what is your favorite brand? [Person2]:  I love all the fashionable things. But my favorite brand is Chanel. [Person1]:  Oh, that's a very expensive brand, but with good reason. [Person2]:  Yeah. Each style is specially designed by world's top designers. So they can always make you look amazing. [Person1]:  I see. Come here. The high heels here look really attractive. But I wonder whether it's comfortable to wear any of them? [Person2]:  Not really, especially at the beginning, if you wear high heels all day long, your feet would hurt. But, no big deal. Women can always get used to that. [Person1]:  It's not a simple thing to be beautiful. [Person2]:  Sure. But everyone loves to be beautiful. Hey, do you think this pair of sunglasses matches the handbag well? [Person1]:  Yeah, very tasteful. And with them, you look even more fashionable. Oh, there are so many French perfumers. Oops, perfumes for guys? So strange! [Person2]:  Come on. Fashion is not only for women. Men also share the equal right to chase fashion. It's the new fashion for men to wear perfumes, which is called cologne. [Person1]:  Oh, really, that's really something new. I'm afraid not everyone can accept it. [Person2]:  It takes time for that. But people's consuming attitudes are changing quickly. [Person1]:  That's true. Well, it's obvious that fashion is not a cheap thing. So, do you spend all your money on it? [Person2]:  No. Fashion is just part of my life, which improves its quality. But also, I'm good at financing. I have a credit card, but I never overdraft. [Person1]:  How is it that you are my mom's sis? You two are so different. She always picks up bargains and spends more than she earns. You do so much better than her. [Person2]:  I have to say that's just the result of difference of our consumptive habits.
[Person1]:  How many places have you worked altogether? [Person2]:  Three. [Person1]:  Would you tell me the general description of your present job? [Person2]:  I am in charge of the trading department. I'm handling invoices, shipping bills and computing freight costs, that's most of the documentation. [Person1]:  What time do you go to work? [Person2]:  I must be there no later than 9 [Person1]:  What time does the office close? [Person2]:  I quit work whenever I get finished, usually about six o'clock. [Person1]:  Does your work involve a lot of paper filling and typing? [Person2]:  No, the secretary does this. It's not part of my job. [Person1]:  What made you decide to change your job? [Person2]:  I am working in a small company where further promotion is impossible, so I decided to change my job. I'd like to find a job which is more challenging.
[Person1]:  I hear your boss has a real good impression of you and he is thinking about giving you two more days off each month. [Person2]:  I hope not. I'd rather get more work hours so I can get enough bucks to help out my two kids at college.
[Person1]:  Hey, do you know the bus company network system crashed?  [Person2]:  I heard about it several days ago!  [Person1]:  That is unbelievable!  [Person3]:  Daddy, can you tell me what they are talking about?  [Person4]:  They are talking about the network of the bus company.  [Person3]:  Why is their network not working?  [Person4]:  Because of the IC cards.  [Person3]:  The IC card?  [Person4]:  Yes, Beijing is a big city and there are about 7, 000, 000 people using IC cards on buses.  [Person3]:  And?  [Person4]:  All the people were checking the balance of their cards on the Internet at the same time, that's why the system crashed.  [Person3]:  Oh, that is horrible! 
[Person1]:  I would like to make an offer on this house, but I don't know much about the process. [Person2]:  As your realtor, I am here to take care of this process. How much were you planning on offering? [Person1]:  I really like the house and will pay the full asking price of three hundred and fifty thousand dollars. [Person2]:  We want to leave ourselves some bargaining room. Let's offer three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. [Person1]:  That sounds good, but I don't want this house to get away from me. [Person2]:  The market is fairly down right now, so the offer is a realistic one. [Person1]:  When will we know if they accept the offer? [Person2]:  The owners usually respond to an offer within a few days. [Person1]:  Should I be contacting my bank in the meantime? [Person2]:  You are already pre-qualified for your loan, so you are in good shape.
[Person1]:  And anything to drink?  [Person2]:  Yes, a red wine and a cup of coffee.  [Person1]:  How do you like your coffee?  [Person2]:  With milk but without sugar, please.  [Person1]:  Then how about the wine? Is white wine OK?  [Person2]:  Yes, please. 
[Person1]:  Well, hello, Mr. Atkins. I haven't seen you for weeks, where have you been all this time? [Person2]:  Oh, I've just been to Japan on business. [Person1]:  You sure get around. How many countries have you been to? [Person2]:  Pretty close to 60 countries now. I guess I'm a real world traveler. [Person1]:  Well, if you aren't, I don't know who is. [Person2]:  Maybe someday, I'll settle down here. I just can't seem to stay in one place for very long. [Person1]:  How many years have you been traveling? [Person2]:  I've been with the company for 25 years and traveling all the time.
[Person1]:  What's all the security check about, Jimmy? Does it mean the bar may be a dangerous place? [Person2]:  No, of course not. Just in case. Nothing to worry about. Don't you also do this in China? [Person1]:  I don't know. Maybe the same. Actually, this is my first time being in a bar. [Person2]:  Oh, then it's my honor to be here with you. I can see now why you've been so curious about the bar stuff. You like this place? [Person1]:  Sure. I love this place, especially the decoration. So tasteful! [Person2]:  Yeah. Other than that, the real feature are the excellent drinks. Can I have your ticket? [Person1]:  Here it is. But, what for? We're already in. [Person2]:  Well, with the ticket, you can get a free drink. What would you like? Orange juice? [Person1]:  Yes, orange juice will be fine for me. But how can you get the drink? It's so crowded there around the counter. You can barely move. [Person2]:  I'll show you how. The bar tenders know whose turn it is. And also, I can snap my fingers to catch his attention. [Person1]:  Cool. Thanks.
[Person1]:  Did you do anything fun over the weekend? [Person2]:  I didn't want to go out last weekend, so I decided to stay at home and watch a movie. [Person1]:  Why didn't you want to go out? [Person2]:  I was very tired after working all week. Sometimes on the weekend I don't have enough energy to go out to a movie theater. [Person1]:  Did you download a movie or rent it at the store? [Person2]:  I downloaded it so that I didn't have to remember to return it.
[Person1]:  Welcome to Lincoln Bank. What can we do for you today? [Person2]:  Hello. I called earlier in the week and spoke to someone in the personal loans department about an overseas study loan. She said to come in as soon as I had the chance, as this must be done in person. I'd like to apply today. [Person1]:  OK, that's absolutely fine. I will need to see some credentials before we can get started. Do you have the notification of admission letter from your university, your passport and your visa with you? [Person2]:  Yes, yes. It's all here. There you go. I'm not sure if I need any other proof or guarantee to get this loan, do I? [Person1]:  You do, I'm afraid. There are 3 ways to do this. You can choose, mortgage, pledge or guarantee mode. [Person2]:  Yes, I read about all of these in the brochure and decided which would be more suitable for me. I'd like to go for the guarantee mode, please. [Person1]:  Right, that's no problem. I see you are already well informed. If you choose that one, you can borrow up to 70 % of the total tuition and miscellaneous fees. [Person2]:  OK, that's perfect, 70 % is excellent, it'll be a big help. Thanks.
[Person1]:  So awful! I never fancy my salary is so little. [Person2]:  Oh, don't be so sad. You can ask for a salary raise. [Person1]:  Bingo! I never thought about that before. I am working so hard and my accomplishment is significant, you know. [Person2]:  So you suppose you deserve a salary raise. [Person1]:  I know I deserve it, but I can not find a way to talk with boss about this. [Person2]:  You ought to point out how valuable you are, and tell her those people who have the same situation also get the salary raise. [Person1]:  That sounds reasonable. [Person2]:  Remember it is the boss who hires you and tell her how much you have improved the office efficiency. [Person1]:  That's a point. It seems a little complicated. I will think about this for a while. I owe you one. After all, you give me an inspiration. [Person2]:  Forget it. Good luck. I hope you can make it.
[Person1]:  Hello. Smith's Resident. [Person2]:  Hello. This is the operator. Can I speak to Mr. Smith, please? [Person1]:  This is Mr. Smith. [Person2]:  I have a collect call for you from Jennifer.

[Person1]:  What are you reading, Paul? [Person2]:  Oh, it's a book about naval engineering. [Person1]:  Why are you reading on Friday evening? [Person2]:  Because I've got to write an essay this weekend. [Person1]:  What are you going to do when you've qualified? [Person2]:  I don't know. I'd like to get a job abroad, I think. What are you going to do when your year at Weston is over? [Person1]:  I'm going to spend a few weeks touring Britain, then I'm going back to Canada, I suppose. [Person2]:  What is John going to do? [Person1]:  I think he's going to open a branch of' pretty feet'in London. [Person2]:  What is he doing in Italy? [Person1]:  He's seeing some designers here. He's coming back tomorrow. By the way, what are you and Sue doing on Saturday evening? [Person2]:  I don't know yet. Why? [Person1]:  Well, I thought we could cook another of our suppers and invite John and Sue. [Person2]:  Oh, no! Not Potato Salad again! Sorry, Barbara, but I really have to read this book.
[Person1]:  So will you come to work with us?  [Person2]:  Can I use my green pad again to write you admiring notes?  [Person1]:  We'll have to negotiate that. It's a possibility.

[Person1]:  You are not looking very cheerful. What's the matter with you? [Person2]:  Oh, nothing special. I'm just thinking a lot. [Person1]:  About the job? [Person2]:  About everything. About catching the same train every morning, sitting in the same office all day, watching the same television program... [Person1]:  You need a holiday. [Person2]:  It wasn't always like this, you know. [Person1]:  What do you mean? [Person2]:  Well, our great great grandfathers had more fun, didn't they? I mean, they hunted for their food and grew their own vegetables and did things for themselves. We do the same sort of job for years and years. There's no variety in our lives. [Person1]:  You need a holiday. That's what's the matter is with you.
[Person1]:  Excuse me. I wonder if you could tell me how to find a place to have my shoes mended. I'm new in town. [Person2]:  Ah, there is a good shop not far from here. Go straight ahead and walk about three blocks. I can't remember the name of the shop, but you'll find it. It's near the police station. By the way, you know about the Town Guide? It's a thin book and has all kinds of useful information. You'll find one in any bookstore. [Person1]:  Thanks a lot! You've been so helpful. Let's see. Did you say the repair shop was three blocks away from here? [Person2]:  Exactly. [Person1]:  Thanks again.
[Person1]:  When I was a child, my ambition was to be a train driver. [Person2]:  That isn't a suitable job for women. [Person1]:  Yeah, well. My uncle drove a train and I wanted to be just like him. [Person2]:  Why didn't you realize your dream? [Person1]:  Well, my parents objected. Now of course, I realize that it's dangerous and extremely demanding. When I was in high school, I wanted to be a chemist. But I gave it up because my grades were bad. [Person2]:  How do you feel about your nursing work here? [Person1]:  It is badly paid and stressful, but I think it is rewarding to look after patients.
[Person1]:  Do you like watching the Winter Olympic Games? [Person2]:  Of course. It's the tradition game in winter, and with good reason. Don't you like watching it? [Person1]:  Of course I do. I love it. All the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable. [Person2]:  That's true. For various reasons, it takes more to hold a fierce game for Winter Olympics than it does for Summer Olympics. You know, the low temperature may cause many problems. [Person1]:  Yeah. What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics? [Person2]:  When the Olympic Games started in modern times, only summer events were included. When it grew popular, there came the Winter Olympic Games, which includes a variety of winter sports. [Person1]:  I see. Then, what's your favorite winter sport? [Person2]:  Figure skating. In my eye, nothing beats it. [Person1]:  Then you must know Shen Due and Hao Hongbo. [Person2]:  Oh, I didn't expect you to know them. But yes, I love them not only because of many medals they've won, but also because of many medals they've won, but also because of their spirits. [Person1]:  You should go to talk with May. She is a big fan of them too.
[Person1]:  Are you going to leave school at the end of the term? [Person2]:  Yes, I am. [Person1]:  What are you going to do? [Person2]:  I'm going to be a clerk. [Person1]:  What does a clerk do? [Person2]:  He works in an office. He writes letters and reports, and he types. [Person1]:  I want to be a vet. [Person2]:  A-what? [Person1]:  A vet-a veterinary surgeon. [Person2]:  Good gracious! What's that? [Person1]:  A vet's a man who takes care of sick animals. He's an animal doctor. [Person2]:  I once read a story about a person who talked to animals. It was very interesting.
[Person1]:  Ashley, what a great dinner party! [Person2]:  Thank you, Joe. What would you like to drink with your meal? I can offer you wine, mango juice, or water. [Person1]:  Just water would be fine. [Person2]:  Excellent choice. Can I dish you up some chicken? [Person1]:  Yes, the chicken looks wonderful! [Person2]:  How about some salad to go with your chicken? [Person1]:  Sure, I love salad! [Person2]:  Would you like to have rice with your chicken?

[Person1]:  Mary didn't pass the final exam in physics. [Person2]:  She must be very sad. [Person1]:  Her parents scolded her severely and she's very depressed now. [Person2]:  At a time like this, what she needs is a pat on the back rather than a blame.
[Person1]:  It's a lovely day out today, isn't it? [Person2]:  It's beautiful. Enjoy it while it lasts. It's supposed to get cold tomorrow. [Person1]:  What's the weather forecast for tomorrow? [Person2]:  It's supposed to snow early tomorrow morning and then tomorrow afternoon there's a chance of freezing rain. [Person1]:  That doesn't sound pretty. [Person2]:  Do you have any plans for tomorrow? [Person1]:  Well, I was going to drive to Birmingham to see some friends. [Person2]:  You might want to change your plans. With the cold and wet weather that we're supposed to have tomorrow, the roads are going to be rather slippery. [Person1]:  I suppose I should. I don't like driving in dangerous weather conditions. Do you have any plans for tomorrow? [Person2]:  I just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon. [Person1]:  If you're lucky, it'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day! [Person2]:  If that happens, then I'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies. [Person1]:  That sounds like fun. [Person2]:  Hey, look outside! It's started to drizzle! [Person1]:  English weather is even more predictable than I had previously thought.
[Person1]:  Honey, could you help me operate the VD player? It can't play. [Person2]:  Oh, are the connections correct? [Person1]:  I think so. [Person2]:  Let me see. Look! You confused the video frequency with the audio frequency. [Person1]:  I'm too careless. [Person2]:  Can it work now? [Person1]:  No. [Person2]:  So what's the problem? Maybe there is something wrong with the disk. [Person1]:  It's a new disk. [Person2]:  Give it to me. [Person1]:  Here you are. [Person2]:  Uh, the movie of Tom Hanks. I know why it can't play. This is a DVD disk.
[Person1]:  Are you interested in mountaineering? [Person2]:  Yes. in some sense. I should say I like mountain climbing, you know, because I'm not so professional. How about you?

It IS one of the Five Mountains. [Person1]:  I want to climb Tasha Mountain this summer vacation. Would you be my guide? [Person2]:  I'd love to.
[Person1]:  What problems will exporters face in moving to the foreign market? [Person2]:  An exporter needs to know the social characteristics of people he is dealing with. [Person1]:  Like what? [Person2]:  What do they like or dislike. What languages do they speak, what religions do they follow. [Person1]:  Reasonable. [Person2]:  Especially he needs to know their behavior, their habits, their way of life and the things they are used to.

[Person1]:  Do you know why Thursday is called Thursday? [Person2]:  Huh? What are you talking about? [Person1]:  OK. Let me put my question this way. Do you know who Thor is? [Person2]:  Thor? You mean the god in Norse mythology. [Person1]:  Correct. So Thursday actually is Thor's day in memory of the god of Thunder. [Person2]:  That's new to me. What about Wednesday? [Person1]:  Well, we can consider Mr. Wednesday as Mr. Thursdays' father. [Person2]:  What? [Person1]:  Wednesday actually is Woden's Day, and Woden is the old English for the god Odin, Thor's father.
[Person1]:  Hello. This is the Directory Assistance. Can I help you? [Person2]:  Can you give me the number for Jessica Hanson on locks Ave? [Person1]:  I ' m sorry. There is no listing under that name. Are you sure of the name? [Person2]:  Yes, I ' m pretty sure. [Person1]:  Do you have her address? [Person2]:  Yes, I do. It ' s 109 Locks Ave, L8V 4N9. [Person1]:  That ' s an unlisted number. I ' m sorry, but I can ' t give it to you. [Person2]:  I see. Thanks anyway. [Person1]:  No problem.
[Person1]:  Lisa, is there a milk section? [Person2]:  No, there's no such section. The dairy section is where you'll find milk and cheese. [Person1]:  What's Condiments? [Person2]:  That's where you'll find things like salt and pepper. [Person1]:  Oh, I see. [Person2]:  Let's go to aisle 4 to pick up some pasta for tonight. [Person1]:  Great! Pasta for dinner. [Person2]:  And let's get a loaf of bread at the bakery for breakfast. [Person1]:  Maybe we should get a shopping cart. [Person2]:  I'll put the shopping basket back.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, do you go to the Central Park? [Person2]:  Yes, this is the right bus. [Person1]:  Could you please tell me when I get to the Central Park? [Person2]:  Don't worry. I'll call out the stops. [Person1]:  ( A few minutes later. ) Should I get off at the next stop? [Person2]:  No, don't worry. I'll get you off when you get there. [Person1]:  Is it a long ride? [Person2]:  No, not that long. Two more stops, and you'll get off, sir. [Person1]:  OK. I know. Thank you. [Person2]:  Not at all.
[Person1]:  What is your major? [Person2]:  My major is Business Administration, I am especially interested in Marketing. [Person1]:  Which university are you attending? [Person2]:  I attended Suzhou University. [Person1]:  Have you received any degrees? [Person2]:  Yes. I received my Bachelor degree in Business Administration. [Person1]:  What course did you like best? [Person2]:  Project Management. I was very interested in this course when I was a student. And I think it's very useful for my present work. [Person1]:  Do you feel that you have received a good general training? [Person2]:  Yes, I have studied in an English training program and a computer training program since I graduated from university. I am currently studying Finance at a training school. [Person1]:  English and computer skills are comparatively important to this post, especially in the starting period. Wharfs your ability in these two fields? [Person2]:  I passed college English Test Band - 4, with good skill in listening, speaking, reading and writing. I haven't got any certificate of computer skills, because I don't think certificates are necessary if what's needed is merely operating a computer. I think, to know how to use a computer is more important. And I'm quite familiar with Microsoft Office
[Person1]:  Alan, I believe you have studied our catalogue and price list. Are you interested in some of our products? [Person2]:  Yes, I'm thinking of buying some T-shirts, but I find your price is on the high side. [Person1]:  I'm very surprised to hear you say that. I think our price is very favorable. You can hardly get such an attractive price from other suppliers. [Person2]:  I'm not so sure of that. I think it's difficult for me to push sales at such a price. [Person1]:  What's your proposal then? [Person2]:  I think to get the business done, you should at least reduce the price by 20 %. [Person1]:  We could take a cut on the price if your order is a large one, but a 20 % reduction is really more than we can do. What quantity are you going to order from us then? [Person2]:  As a trial order, I'll take 5, 000 dozen this time. [Person1]:  5, 000 dozen is by no means a large order. In that case, the best I can do is to give you a 5 % reduction. [Person2]:  That's really a big change from 20 %. I really can't accept that. [Person1]:  What's your counter-offer then? [Person2]:  To conclude the deal, I'd say a reduction of at least 15 % would help. [Person1]:  15 % is impossible. That'll leave us almost no profit. [Person2]:  If that's the case, I'll have to go somewhere else to meet my needs. [Person1]:  How about doing it this way? You increase your quantity to 8, 000 dozen and I'll give you a l0 % reduction. [Person2]:  8000 would be too large a figure to be used for a trial. [Person1]:  Well, to encourage future business, I'm prepared to reduce the price by 10 %. We can't go any further. [Person2]:  Ok. Let's call it a deal.
[Person1]:  I hope the food here is good. [Person2]:  Yes, it is very expensive. Maybe we shouldn't have come here. [Person1]:  But the guidebook says a lot of the stars come here. If we are spending three days in Hollywood, I want to see at least one star. [Person2]:  I think we might not see any. [Person1]:  Did you like the tour of Universal Studios? [Person2]:  I thought it was O. K. But it really was too hot. And I think they should show people more. The exhibits should be more interesting. [Person1]:  I thought it was great. Didn't you like the special effects rooms? [Person2]:  Yes, but I still think it could be better.
[Person1]:  I've never seen a machine like this before and need some help. [Person2]:  Sure, no problem. What are you trying to get? [Person1]:  I want to buy a drink. [Person2]:  OK. This machine needs you to use that change machine first to get correct change. [Person1]:  I've got the correct change already. [Person2]:  First you put your money in the dollar slot or the coin slot. The dollars have to be smooth. [Person1]:  OK, what next? [Person2]:  Just know that sometimes the money doesn't go in perfectly the first time and you have to try again. [Person1]:  OK, next? [Person2]:  Choose what you want and push the button. Sometimes it takes a couple of tries. [Person1]:  I agree with you. [Person2]:  Hope that works for you!
[Person1]:  Have you ever found yourself in a situation when you have to lie to people who trust you? [Person2]:  Do you mean lying to people for their good? [Person1]:  Yes. Is it wrong to lie to them even if it is for their good? [Person2]:  It's hard to say. I mean, how can you judge what's good for them? Maybe it is best to tell them the truth no matter what it is. [Person1]:  But sometimes it is so hard to tell the truth. [Person2]:  I know. If you're sure the truth will do harm, maybe you can choose not to tell it.
[Person1]:  What colour is her hair? [Person2]:  Oh, blonde, she's very blonde. . . quite short hair. . . [Person1]:  What, curly? [Person2]:  No, not at all. Very straight. Her hair comes down like this. . . just over the ears. [Person1]:  Does she wear glasses? [Person2]:  No. . . no. I think you're thinking of someone else. [Person1]:  No. I'm sure I know her. [Person2]:  Er. . . what else can I tell you? Er. . . she's got. . . er a. . . round face, a very round face, and a very big mouth, sort of wide mouth, when she laughs, her face is all mouth. [Person1]:  Ah. . . No, I can't place her.
[Person1]:  Jane, we are going to have a board meeting next Friday. Will you please arrange it for me? [Person2]:  Certainly, Mr. Robert. But can I have your plan? [Person1]:  Sure. Actually it's a routine board meeting. The things to be discussed are all written here. [Person2]:  Very good. May I keep it? I need it to draw up a notice of the meeting and the agenda. [Person1]:  Go ahead. It's for your reference. While you are at it, make me a special agenda and don't forget to have enough room at the side for notes. [Person2]:  You mean you need a more detailed agenda for yourself? [Person1]:  Exactly. As I am supposed to the chair of the meeting, I don't want it to get out of control. [Person2]:  I see. Ok, then where do you think we will have the meeting? [Person1]:  The conference room on the second floor, is that ok? [Person2]:  Yes, I will see that the room is ready by Friday. And I will check there are enough chairs, and the lighting and air-conditioning are all right. [Person1]:  Good, and please get some water, glasses and ash tray ready as well. [Person2]:  Sure, I will. What about the minutes? Do you think I am responsible for that too? [Person1]:  Definitely. The minutes have to be taken accurately. [Person2]:  But I am not familiar with the members of the board. [Person1]:  Oh, that's easy. I will write you a list of their names. You can make a seating plan with the names and give each one a number. [Person2]:  That's a good idea. All right, I'll withdraw and get down to it if you don't mind.
[Person1]:  Can you tell the result? [Person2]:  It's love all. [Person1]:  Now the score is in our favor. [Person2]:  Can you tell which team seems to win? [Person1]:  Hard to say. Now the score is in our favor. [Person2]:  Yes. Our guest team is really tough. [Person1]:  They're still fighting hard. Let's wait and see.
[Person1]:  Who are we going to play with today? [Person2]:  We are playing against Hainan. [Person1]:  Oh, the basketball team from No. 1 College? I know they're a tough team. [Person2]:  Sure they are. [Person1]:  Who's winning? [Person2]:  We are, 27 to 26. [Person1]:  Really? I thought that they'd been killing us by now. [Person2]:  How can it be? We are a tough team as well.
[Person1]:  What was that? [Person2]:  Oh no. I broke your vase accidentally. [Person1]:  How did it happen? [Person2]:  I bumped it by accident, but I didn't mean to do it. [Person1]:  It was my favorite. [Person2]:  I feel miserable. Can I give you money for it? [Person1]:  Maybe I shouldn't have put it here. Someone was bound to bump it eventually. [Person2]:  First I was late for school this morning, and now I broke your vase. This isn't my day!
[Person1]:  Hi, this is Ralph Simmons. With whom am I speaking? [Person2]:  This is Paula Blake, Mr. Simmons. How can I help you? [Person1]:  I'm hoping you can sort a few things out for me. Could you pull up my account? [Person2]:  Certainly, sir. Just tell me your account number please.
[Person1]:  How are your stocks doing, Jim? [Person2]:  Oh, all right. I lost a bunch of money in the last two years, but this year has been pretty good. [Person1]:  Yeah, I lost money investing in the internet too. [Person2]:  Just goes to show that you should buy companies not ideas. [Person1]:  I changed my strategy around too. I invest in good companies now. [Person2]:  Yeah, me too. Did you hear about Ted? [Person1]:  No. What happened? [Person2]:  He lost his kids'college money by trading. [Person1]:  Oh, boy. His wife can't be happy about that.
[Person1]:  Hi, I'm calling about the ad in the paper. [Person2]:  Which ad would that be? [Person1]:  For the job. [Person2]:  Good, which job is that? We advertised several openings. [Person1]:  Oh! It was for a market sale manager. Is that still available? [Person2]:  Yes, it is. But we'll be making a decision on it pretty soon. Why don't you come in and fill out an application? [Person1]:  What company is this for? I mean where's the opening? [Person2]:  We can discuss that when you come in and fill out the application. [Person1]:  Well, I'm already in this field and know most of the companies. Before I come in to fill out an application, I need to know who it's with so I know whether or not I'm willing to work with them. [Person2]:  I'm afraid I can't discuss that over the phone. [Person1]:  So you're a headhunter. [Person2]:  We're an Employment Agency.
[Person1]:  Well, we'll certainly stay here again next time when we're passing through! [Person2]:  Good! Do let us know in advance. And we'll try to get you the same room. [Person1]:  That would be lovely. It may be quite soon in fact. [Person2]:  Oh, how's that? [Person1]:  Well, we're driving to the south of Spain in the next couple of days and we may come back this week. [Person2]:  Do give us a ring if you decide to. I hope you'll have a pleasant trip.
[Person1]:  Hello, New Green Forest Store. May I help you? [Person2]:  I'm thinking about buying a new TV set, and some of my friends recommended the Brand TCL to me. Can you tell me what is special about them? [Person1]:  Well, we call them high-quality TV sets because they have much clearer pictures than the old ones. [Person2]:  I see. How much does each cost? [Person1]:  2000 dollars. If you buy one before the end of the month, you can get a DVD player as a special gift. [Person2]:  That sounds nice. I will buy two then. [Person1]:  Where do you live, may I ask? [Person2]:  Does it matter where I live? [Person1]:  It's like this [Person2]:  Well, I guess you can just bring the Tvsets to Number 88, Morning Sun Street. [Person1]:  OK. They will be there soon.
[Person1]:  I'm worried about my son at driving, but he won't listen to me. [Person2]:  Well, teenagers always think they won't get hurt, but the fact is just the opposite. [Person1]:  What should I do? [Person2]:  Keep talking with him and lead by an example. Parents always matter.
[Person1]:  What is this? I didn't order that.  [Person2]:  I'm terribly sorry. May I have your order again? I'll get it right away.  [Person1]:  I've ordered savory pork and coleslaw.  [Person2]:  I'm sorry. I must have made a mistake. I'll bring them for you at once.  [Person1]:  Hey! What is this?  [Person2]:  Pardon me, Miss. But didn't you order chicken soup?  [Person1]:  Oh, Is that what this is?  [Person2]:  I believe so. But if it really bothers you, I'll replace it for you.  [Person1]:  No, don't replace it. Give a refund.  [Person2]:  Sorry. I'm afraid we can't. But you may order something else instead.  [Person1]:  Oh, really? Give me a clam soup.  [Person2]:  Okay, Miss.  [Person1]:  Thank you.  [Person2]:  I hope you enjoy your dinner. 
[Person1]:  Lester, you are really fantastic at automobile repair.  [Person2]:  Thanks, June. But I think I need to be certified as a mechanic before I'm allowed to repair cars for a living.  [Person1]:  That's not a big problem. There are many small schools for adults like you who can study to be certified.  [Person2]:  I guess I never thought of that before.  [Person1]:  And you can easily get a student loan from a vocational school, or from the government.  [Person2]:  Wow, you've inspired me to do something! 
[Person1]:  Excuse me, can you tell me how to get to the History Museum? [Person2]:  Sure. Go through Central Park, pass the high school. Then turn left at the Hilton Hotel, a five-star hotel. It's 2... Um... Oh, no, 3 blocks from here. [Person1]:  Thank you. That sounds easy to find. [Person2]:  Yes. But it's closed today. It's not open on Saturday and Sunday. Just on weekdays, you know.
[Person1]:  Good morning, Angela, how have you been lately? [Person2]:  Morning, Michael. I ' Ve been very busy lately. One of our other vendors is going out of business and I ' Ve been searching for a suitable replacement. [Person1]:  Well, rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run, sitdown. Coffee? [Person2]:  No, thanks. I ' Ve been trying to cut down on the caffeine. [Person1]:  Haha, I could never do that. I ' d be a zombie if I didn ' t have my morning coffee fix. Let ' s get down to business then. [Person2]:  Yes. I ' Ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone. The demand for phone cameras is growing, and Pear has been falling behind in the market. [Person1]:  That ' s great! I ' m glad to hear that Pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon. Right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras. Is Pear still interested in having those? [Person2]:  No, we ' re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels. We were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal. [Person1]:  Surely. Let ' s get started by drafting a new contract.
[Person1]:  Can I have my check, please. [Person2]:  Here it is. 350 Yuan all together. [Person1]:  May son adores my new hairstyle so I suppose it is worth it. [Person2]:  Hearing you say that is a big reward for us. And here is the receipt. [Person1]:  Thank you. [Person2]:  Wait! Congratulations! You are the lucky customer of our anniversary celebration. [Person1]:  Wow, it's surprising. So what do I get? [Person2]:  You can have a free facial and then make up free for you. Do you want it now? [Person1]:  Probably not. Doing that will probably take another three hours which I can't afford now. [Person2]:  Here is our number. Call us when you are ready to come. [Person1]:  You mean I should make an appointment ahead of time? [Person2]:  Yes. [Person1]:  Got it. Bye for now.
[Person1]:  What's the date today Mr. Brown. I don't have a calendar. [Person2]:  Today is Tuesday, 25th September, 2001. [Person1]:  25th Sep? Oh, I have an appointment tonight. [Person2]:  What time is your appointment? [Person1]:  It is at 8 o'clock. [Person2]:  What time is now? Do you have the correct time? [Person1]:  I don't know what time it is. It must be about 6 o'clock. I have to go now. I don't want to be late. [Person2]:  You won't be late. It's still early.
[Person1]:  I can't even imagine you snorkeling! [Person2]:  Well, you'll see. With this new watch, I can go anywhere, do anything. [Person1]:  OK, Bond. [Person2]:  No, really. Look. It's got a double time zone setting. [Person1]:  So you can always keep two times at once? [Person2]:  Yep. I just can't decide what two cities to choose. . . [Person1]:  The only two times you need are I'm late and I'm really late.
[Person1]:  What is the weather like today? [Person2]:  It stops snowing, but there's a bit wind. [Person1]:  And the streets are covered with ice. Do you know what the temperature is today? [Person2]:  I missed today's weather for cast in the radio [Person1]:  It seems 10 degree below zero at least. I don't mind the cold weather, but do hate when it get slippery. [Person2]:  The ice is soon be thick for skating. I'm so fine to want a sport [Person1]:  That's fine. let's go skating together tomorrow.
[Person1]:  Why do you look so gloomy? What are you looking for? [Person2]:  My dissertation. I put it somewhere last night and I can't find it now. [Person1]:  Did you finish typing it yesterday? [Person2]:  Yes, I kept on typing it until midnight, but it is lost. [Person1]:  Don't worry about it. It must be somewhere in your room. Let's see where you put it. Have you searched your drawers and the desk? [Person2]:  Yes, but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk. [Person1]:  How about the shelf? [Person2]:  I've searched everywhere. Where on earth did I put it? [Person1]:  Don't get upset over it. At least you have another week to go. [Person2]:  I have been working on it for a whole month and it's too late to write another. Just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing. How could I do such a thing? [Person1]:  Cheer up! What I meant was that you can find it sometime during a week. There is no need to write a new one. Oh, what's this? Is this your dissertation? [Person2]:  Let me see. Yes, that's it. Where did you find it? [Person1]:  You'Ve put it among these journals. [Person2]:  My poor memory. Thank you very much.
[Person1]:  Hey, guys! Did you see that sign? [Person2]:  No. What did it say? [Person1]:  There's a garage sale around the corner. [Person2]:  A garage sale. . . that's where people check out cars, right? [Person1]:  What? Cars? Are you serious? [Person2]:  I'm pulling your leg, Paul. I'm a shopping queen, remember? So of course I know what a garage sale is all about!
[Person1]:  Thank God, it's Friday! Time for a drink! Let's hit the bars! [Person2]:  OK. I don't mind going bar hopping with an expert like you. [Person1]:  Should we start with beer or wine or go straight to the hard liquor? [Person2]:  I think I'll have a glass of wine. Let's see. . . they have red wine, white wine and port. They even have sangria! It's the happy hour special. [Person1]:  Port's too sweet. It's a dessert wine. A dry red French wine would be nice with meat. A glass of chilled white German wine would be good with fish. But, we're not eating and it's hot out, so I think I'll have a tall glass of sangria with ice. [Person2]:  Good choice! But, what's your favorite kind of hard liquor? [Person1]:  I like to stick to the clean stuff, like vodka, gin, white rum and other clear spirits.
[Person1]:  What's up? You don't look too good. [Person2]:  Yeah, my head hurts, that's all. I'Ve been in physics class all day. It's killer! [Person1]:  I liked physics. It's all math, really. arcs, curves, velocity, cool stuff. [Person2]:  Yeah, yeah, but today's lesson was all about the creation of the universe. [Person1]:  A physics class about the creation of the universe? That's some pretty unscientific language there. Sounds more religious to me. [Person2]:  It's all religion. Take the theory of the Big Bang. How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion? That's no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff. [Person1]:  Turtles? Whatever. . . Look, all that's required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles. At least, that's what the math says. [Person2]:  Math, sheath. What's the evidence? [Person1]:  There is evidence! You know Edwin Hubble? He's the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe, thus advancing notions of an expanding universe. What would it be expanding from? Well, the Big Bang. . . DUH! [Person2]:  Anyway, it's just a theory. Why do people go around touting theories? Where's the scientific rigor in that? [Person1]:  Dude, don't equivocate. A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing. You slept through class, didn't you?
[Person1]:  Why don't you begin by telling me something about yourself? [Person2]:  What do you want to know? [Person1]:  The usual, you know, something about your background and experience and anything personal that you feel is pertinent. [Person2]:  Well, I was born in Shanghai and went to school there, right up through college. My father is a lawyer, and my mother is a teacher. [Person1]:  Sounds as if you come from a professional family. [Person2]:  That right. One of my sisters is a doctor and the other one teaches at a university. [Person1]:  What made you decide to get into computers? [Person2]:  Oh, nothing in particular, I guess. I always liked mathematics and tinkering with machines. [Person1]:  Now what about your experience? How long have you been working with computers? [Person2]:  More than five years now. After I did my engineering degree, I began to specialize in computer technology and I even had my own company for a while. [Person1]:  It certainly sounds impressive. Why don't you have your credentials sent to me and I'll show them to the board? We'll probably get back to you in a week. [Person2]:  Thanks very much.
[Person1]:  Honey, the basketball game is about to start. And could you bring some chips and a bowl of ice cream? And ... uh ... a slice of pizza from the fridge. [Person2]:  Anything else? [Person1]:  Nope, that's all for now. Hey, hon, you know, they're organizing a company basketball team, and I'm thinking about joining. What do you think? [Person2]:  Humph [Person1]:  'Humph' What do you mean 'Humph.' I was the star player in high school. [Person2]:  Yeah, twenty-five years ago. Look, I just don't want you having a heart attack running up and down the court. [Person1]:  So, what are you suggesting? Should I just abandon the idea? I'm not that out of shape. [Person2]:  Well ... you ought to at least have a physical before you begin. I mean, it HAS been at least five years since you played at all. [Person1]:  Well, okay, but ... [Person2]:  And you need to watch your diet and cut back on the fatty foods, like ice cream. And you should try eating more fresh fruits and vegetables. [Person1]:  Yeah, you're probably right. [Person2]:  And you should take up a little weight training to strengthen your muscles or perhaps try cycling to build up your cardiovascular system. Oh, and you need to go to bed early instead of watching TV half the night. [Person1]:  Hey, you're starting to sound like my personal fitness instructor! [Person2]:  No, I just love you, and I want you to be around for a long, long time.
[Person1]:  Something very unusual happened to me this morning. [Person2]:  Really? What was it? [Person1]:  I was studying in the classroom when Tom came rushing in. [Person2]:  Yes? [Person1]:  He told me there was a telegram for me at the gate house! Someone was ill in my family. [Person2]:  Goodness me! I hate telegrams. They seldom bring any good news. [Person1]:  Yes, that's just how I felt. My legs turned to water, so I asked Tom to accompany me to the school gate. [Person2]:  I can imagine how you felt. [Person1]:  On my way to the school gate I was thinking terrible things. What could have happened at home, you know, and all that. [Person2]:  Yes, of course. I understand. [Person1]:  So when I tore the telegram open, my fingers were trembling. [Person2]:  Dear me! [Person1]:  But when I read the telegram, I just couldn't make heads or tails out of it. [Person2]:  How strange! What did it say? [Person1]:  It said [Person2]:  Oh, I am sorry to hear that. [Person1]:  But the surprising part about it is that I have no uncle. [Person2]:  Indeed! [Person1]:  I could hardly believe my own eyes. But it was written there in black and white. Then I happened to glance at the address to a 'Carl', not 'Carol'. [Person2]:  Well, I never! [Person1]:  You can never imagine how relieved I was. [Person2]:  Yes. What a relief! But what did Tom have to say? [Person1]:  Tom was so embarrassed. He kept apologizing all the way back. [Person2]:  He has always been quite careless.
[Person1]:  Good morning, Mr. Jacob. Is everything all tight? [Person2]:  No, it's not. Someone's stolen some of my valuables two rings and a gold necklace. [Person1]:  I'm very sorry to hear that, sir. Where were they? [Person2]:  In my room. And the door was locked. It can only be one of your staff. I want my things back. And fast. [Person1]:  Well, I can certainly understand that you're upset about losing them and we'll do all we can to help. If they really are missing,it's a matter for the police. [Person2]:  What do you mean, if they are missing? I told you they were. [Person1]:  Yes, Sir. But first I'll have one of the housekeeping staff look through your room in case they're still there. But I must say that we can't be held responsible. You should have deposited the valuables with Reception. It says so on the Key Card. [Person2]:  That's not good enough. I want to see the manager immediately. [Person1]:  I'll be glad to call the duty manager for you, sir. But he'll certainly say the same. We have clear instructions about valuables and we must follow them.
[Person1]:  We are glad to have Dr. Garfield to talk to us today about dreams. Let me start by asking the first question. Does everyone dream? [Person2]:  It appears that everyone does. Mostly when people say that they never dream, what they really mean is that they don't remember their dreams or they don't think their dreams are important. The reason behind is that they might have been made fun of with a child when they first reported their dreams or it was so frightening that they just turned off dreaming completely. The other day, someone named Davis came to me and said that he used to be a great dreamer, but suddenly he stopped having dreams. I asked him what it happened. It turned out that his brother died by heart attack and he never expected that such a terrible thing would happen to a young person. Generally, when there was some frightening event and dream about it was too terrible. People prefer not to dream about it. Actually the worst thing you can do is stop dreaming. Because it means that the bad experience would be too painful to even appear in dreams. As long as you dream about it and even the dream is frightening, your mind is working on it. My personal opinion about what dreams do is that they help us deal with our problems. We see certain patterns take place in dreams. When a person is hurt deep inside, when a person is seriously ill or when a person has been really sad, if people turn off their dreams totally, it means they don't love themselves to even think about it.
[Person1]:  Are you ready to order?  [Person2]:  Yes, I'll have the Texas chili burger.  [Person1]:  Would you like fries with that?  [Person2]:  A large, with tons of ketchup.  [Person1]:  And to drink?  [Person2]:  I'll have a diet coke, please.  [Person1]:  Is this dine-in or take-out?  [Person2]:  Take-out, please. 
[Person1]:  May I take your order?  [Person2]:  What would you like, Miss Tang?  [Person3]:  Well, (Pointing to the menu) I'll take this and this.  [Person2]:  I'd like a steak and some French fries. Er. . . may I see the wine list, please?  [Person1]:  Here you are.  [Person2]:  A bottle of red wine, please.  [Person1]:  Anything else?  [Person2]:  No, thank you. That's all. 
[Person1]:  Jill, how do you like your new job ?  [Person2]:  I like it. But how did you know about my new job? I wanted to surprise you.  [Person1]:  I just heard through the grapevine something about you landing a job with some travel agency down town. You can still fill me in on tile details.  [Person2]:  Well, two weeks ago I got a tip about a possible job opening at Ace Travel Agency over on Franklin Avenue.  [Person1]:  Sure, I think I know the place.  [Person2]:  Well, anyway, I made a beeline over to their office, had an interview with the manager, and was told to start work the next day.  [Person1]:  That's really great, jill. So, what do you do there exactly ?  [Person2]:  Right now I'm basically just a secretary, but if I'm given the chance, I want to become a travel agent there.  [Person1]:  Don't tell me your' re already bucking for a promotion.  [Person2]:  No, of course not. I've got a lot to learn yet. In the meantime, I just want to be a good secretary and not step on anyone's toes.  [Person1]:  Well I wish you luck. 
[Person1]:  Mr. Rogers?  [Person2]:  Yes?  [Person1]:  I'm not feeling too well.  [Person2]:  Would you like to go to the nurse's?  [Person1]:  Yes, I would.  [Person2]:  Here's a hall pass for it. Do you need someone to walk you there?  [Person1]:  I can manage on my own. Thanks.  [Person2]:  I'll drop by later to check on you. 
[Person1]:  Morning, Mrs. Jones. [Person2]:  Morning, what's wrong? [Person1]:  Well, I've made a list here of all the things that are already in my job description and I'm very happy with that. What I'm not really comfortable with are all the extra duties that I'm having to take on at the moment. [Person2]:  Do you need someone to help you? [Person1]:  To be honest, I'm OK about doing the extra work. I just feel that some sort of a salary increase would be appropriate. [Person2]:  I can't make a decision right now, but I'll look at the details and tell you the result next week. Alright? [Person1]:  OK.
[Person1]:  How did you sleep last night? [Person2]:  OK, I guess. But I think all the studying I did for physics last night affected my dreams. [Person1]:  What do you mean? [Person2]:  I mean that I dreamt about physics last night. [Person1]:  Dreamt about physics? What did you dream about? [Person2]:  Hmm...I think I remember Newton falling out of an apple tree, but I'm not too sure. [Person1]:  Jeez, you shouldn't study so hard. [Person2]:  Nothing like this ever happened to you? [Person1]:  Well. Once I was having a really tough final exam in French, and I spent a whole week just studying. And I had a really strange dream about someone asking me questions in French. [Person2]:  What did the person ask? [Person1]:  I don't know. In my dream, I kept explaining that I didn't know a lot of French and I kept asking if he knew English.
[Person1]:  Welcome to the parent teacher conference. So what is your child's name? [Person2]:  Megan Jones. [Person1]:  Let's see, um, she missed the last couple of days has she been sick? [Person2]:  No, she's been having some problems with the other kids in your class. [Person1]:  Well, you know, junior high school is the difficult time, but she just needs to speak up a little more in class. [Person2]:  No, it's more than that. Some of the kids in your class have been joking around with her a lot about her appearance. And then the other day, you didn't help at all. She said, you commented on her blouse and jeans. Saying they were from the nineteen seventies. [Person1]:  Well, I was just kind of joking a little bit with her. [Person2]:  Yeah, that's what you think, but the other kids follow your example. In fact, one of the kids took a picture of her with their phone and posted it on Facebook with some really mean comments. [Person1]:  I'm sorry if I hurt her feelings, could you see if you can bring her to school tomorrow? Uh I'd like to apologize and see what I can do to improve the situation. [Person2]:  Ok.
[Person1]:  What do you do besides work and watching TV? [Person2]:  When I have some time, I like to exercise. [Person1]:  Do you go jogging or do you go to a health club? [Person2]:  I joined Samsung Health Club a couple of months ago. [Person1]:  How do you exercise? [Person2]:  I usually spend 30 minutes on the bicycle for the Carpio, and then I lift weight for about 45 minutes. [Person1]:  How often do you go? [Person2]:  I want to go four times a week, but I'm too lazy. Last week, I only went to workout once.
[Person1]:  Do you have a swimming pool in this hotel? [Person2]:  We don't have a swimming pool, sir, but we do have swim stations in the gym. [Person1]:  I never heard of a swim station. Is that like a train or bus station? [Person2]:  It's just a deep bathtub with a current of water that you swim against. [Person1]:  Holy cow! I never heard of such a thing. How much do they cost? [Person2]:  As a guest, sir, you pay nothing. [Person1]:  This sounds better every second. Now, when can I use the stations? [Person2]:  If you want to swim, you can visit the gym any day between 7 a. m. and 10 p. m. [Person1]:  Oh, boy! This is going to be great. I'm going to the gym right now! [Person2]:  I'm sure you'll enjoy your workout, sir. Everyone seems to like the swim stations.
[Person1]:  The music has started. [Person2]:  How do you like this waltz? [Person1]:  It's very nice. [Person2]:  May I ask you for a dance? [Person1]:  Certainly. [Person2]:  You are doing the waltz wonderfully well. [Person1]:  Thanks. I'm glad you say so. Oh, the music has stopped.
[Person1]:  The idea about Friday the Thirteenth is totally ridiculous. I don't believe it at all. [Person2]:  Maybe you can't be so sure. [Person1]:  Why not? The whole idea is superstitious. [Person2]:  But some people use this occasion to create trouble. Have you heard of the Black Friday Virus on the computer? It is designed to break out on every Friday the Thirteenth. [Person1]:  I know that. But that has nothing to do with being unlucky. Those who created the virus are deliberately making fun of people.
[Person1]:  Did you happen to bring that book that we were talking about yesterday? [Person2]:  I did. Let me go get it for you. Here you go. [Person1]:  Thanks so much. [Person2]:  I like the way that the gifts I get increasingly more lavish. [Person1]:  I had no idea that there were specific things that should be given on different anniversaries. [Person2]:  So what does it say you should give your wife this first anniversary? [Person1]:  It says that traditionally, give something made of paper. [Person2]:  I can think of two things made of paper, stationery and money.
[Person1]:  Would you consider an offer of $ 56, 000 per year? [Person2]:  What kind of benefits are we talking about? [Person1]:  Our standard package includes health insurance, two weeks vacation and a company car. [Person2]:  Are these things negotiable? [Person1]:  Uh. . . not normally. What do you have in mind? [Person2]:  Vacation time is important to me. I would be willing to give up these other items in order to receive more vacation days. [Person1]:  What an interesting idea, Ms. Wilson. Would you also be willing to accept a cut in initial salary? [Person2]:  Possibly. What do you have in mind?
[Person1]:  The Smiths are arriving at our city tomorrow. Can you draw up a schedule for them? If they want to make any changes, minor changes can then be made. [Person2]:  Is there anything special they would like to do? [Person1]:  They would like to visit our factory and have a look at the new type computer products. Besides, they will introduce their technique in computer manufacturing. [Person2]:  That can easily be arranged. I will arrange a comfortable meeting room for them. Anything else? [Person1]:  They would also like to have a meeting with our designers. And this time, their visit to our company will lay the basement for our cooperation, so you need to pay more attention. [Person2]:  I will set it up. [Person1]:  They will stay for two days. Try to work out an efficient schedule.
[Person1]:  Can we talk? [Person2]:  What about? [Person1]:  I'm not too clear on some things about my lease. [Person2]:  Is there a problem? [Person1]:  How many years is my lease for? [Person2]:  In three years your lease will be up. [Person1]:  Can I move out before those three years? [Person2]:  If you do, I will keep your deductible. [Person1]:  Why would you keep it? [Person2]:  I would keep it because you would be breaking our contract. [Person1]:  I get it now. [Person2]:  I hope that I cleared things up for you.
[Person1]:  Hello. [Person2]:  Is this Mr. Smith's office? [Person1]:  Yes, it is. [Person2]:  Is he there? [Person1]:  I'm sorry, he isn't. He's at a meeting this morning. [Person2]:  What time will he be back? [Person1]:  He'll be back after two o'clock but he'll only be in the office for an hour. [Person2]:  Can I reach him in the conference room? [Person1]:  I'm sorry, but they aren't taking any calls. Can I take message for you? [Person2]:  This is Anne Lucas in the accounts office. I would like a word with him, please. [Person1]:  I can ask him to call you after the meeting. Can I have your number? [Person2]:  Yes, it's 488 -6361. He can reach me there until three o'clock.
[Person1]:  Hi, Sis. I just came over to drop off the DVDs you wanted, and ... Hey, wow!? Where did you get all of this stuff? [Person2]:  I bought it. So, what do you think of my new entertainment center? And the widescreen TV ... [Person1]:  Bought it? [Person2]:  ... and my new DVD player. Here, let me show you my stereo. You can really rock the house with this one. [Person1]:  But where did you get the dough to buy all this? You didn't borrow money from mom and dad again, did you? [Person2]:  Of course not. I got it with this! [Person1]:  This? Let me see that ... Have you been using Dad's credit card again? [Person2]:  No, silly. It's mine. It's student credit card. [Person1]:  A student credit card? How in the world did you get one of these? [Person2]:  I got an application in the mail. [Person1]:  Well, why did you get one in the first place? [Person2]:  Listen. Times are changing, and having a credit card helps you build a credit rating, control spending, and even buy things that you can't pay with cash ... like the plane ticket I got recently. [Person1]:  What plane ticket? [Person2]:  Oh yeah, my roommate and I are going to Hawaii over the school break, and course, I needed some new clothes for that so ... [Person1]:  I don't want to hear it. How does having a student credit card control spending? It sounds you've spent yourself in a hole. Anyway, student credit cards just lead to impulse spending ... as I can see here. And the interest rates of student credit cards are usually sky-high, and if you miss a payment, the rates, well, just jump! [Person2]:  Ah. The credit card has a credit limit ... [Person1]:  ... of $20,000? [Person2]:  No, no quite that high. Anyway, ... [Person1]:  I've heard enough. [Person2]:  Did I tell you we now get digital cable with over 100 channels? Oh, and here's your birthday present. A new MP3 player ... [Person1]:  Yeah. Oh, don't tell me. Charged on the credit card. Listen. Hey, I don't think having a student credit card is a bad idea, but this is ridiculous. And how in the world are you going to pay off your credit card bill? [Person2]:  Um, with my birthday money? It's coming up in a week. [Person1]:  Hey, let's sit down and talk about how you're going to pay things back, and maybe we can come up with a budget that will help you get out of this mess. That's the least I can do.
[Person1]:  Hey, I'm calling to say that I'm running late to the airport. Can you make sure that the plane doesn't take off without me? [Person2]:  I'll try. [Person1]:  Thank you. I'm just sitting here in traffic. There must be an accident or something. I've been here for 30 minutes, and I've barely made it onto the bridge. [Person2]:  Oh, that's not good. [Person1]:  This traffic is really stressing me out. I don't want to have to take a later flight! [Person2]:  I'm sure you'll be able to make it. The plane doesn't leave for another 2 hours. [Person1]:  Yes, but Google Maps is telling me that I won't be at the airport for another hour and 45 minutes, which means I'll only have 15 minutes to check my bags, get through security, and arrive at the gate. That's impossible! [Person2]:  You can ask to skip to the head of the line in security. They're usually pretty good about that when you think you might miss your flight. [Person1]:  I hope so.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, sir, may I take your order now?  [Person2]:  Could we order later? We have five persons altogether and 2 of us are still on the way.  [Person1]:  OK, sir. Please call me when you are ready.  [Person2]:  Yes, thank you. 
[Person1]:  Which church do you attend?  [Person2]:  I am Mormon, so I go to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  [Person1]:  What's the difference between this and other Churches?  [Person2]:  Mormons believe that, after the death of Christ and the death of the Apostles10, their church Christ founded became corrupt and the authority of Christ on earth was lost to men. In 1830, a prophet named Joseph Smith was brought up by God to restore the church.  [Person1]:  Then does that mean the other churches are corrupt?  [Person2]:  That means that they all have parts of the original gospel, but not all.  [Person1]:  Do you believe that Mormons have all of it?  [Person2]:  Yes.  [Person1]:  Why do you really go to church?  [Person2]:  We gather together to encourage each other, because we have common beliefs. We come together and call it church. 
[Person1]:  Mike, do you want to go to the hospital and see Sam this afternoon? [Person2]:  What's happened to him? Is he ill? [Person1]:  No. Haven't you heard about it? He was hit by a car while he was riding his motorbike to school this morning. [Person2]:  Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. I really knew nothing about it. I hope it's not serious. [Person1]:  It was sad that he rolled a few meters away before he stopped unconscious. Luckily, he was wearing his helmet, so his head was well protected. [Person2]:  Have they had him fully examined? [Person1]:  I really have no idea. I hope there aren't any internal injuries. So will you go? [Person2]:  Absolutely.
[Person1]:  Excuse me. I have just missed the connection plane due to the heavy fog in London. Can I change my ticket now? [Person2]:  Please Show your ticket and passport. [Person1]:  Here you are. [Person2]:  Which flight do you want to change? [Person1]:  The next one to my destination. I have to be there as soon as possible.
[Person1]:  Can you give me a hand with some things in the kitchen? I don ' t think I can finish everything in time. [Person2]:  Ok, what do you want me to do? [Person1]:  First of all, I need you to do the drying up. I ' m almost finished the washing up. I ' m going to clean the cooker when I finish. [Person2]:  Ok. I ' ll put the plates and cutlery away as I dry them. Where is the tea towel? Oh, here it is. [Person1]:  We ' ll have this finished in no time with two if us working on it. [Person2]:  While you ' re cleaning the cooker, I ' ll wipe the worktop. That was a great meat, by the way. [Person1]:  Actually, it was just some leftovers from yesterday. I made far too much food to eat alone. I am glad you could come over to help me finish it. [Person2]:  My pleasure! This tea towel ' s a little ragged. Do you have another one? [Person1]:  Yes. Look in that drawer. I should throw the old one out. [Person2]:  Keep it and use it as rag. You can clean your bicycle with it.
[Person1]:  Hi, Craig! How are you? [Person2]:  Not so good. I have a terrible cold. [Person1]:  Really? That's too bad! You should be at home in bed. It's really important to get a lot of rest. [Person2]:  Yeah, you're right. [Person1]:  And have you taken anything for it? [Person2]:  No, I haven't. [Person1]:  Well, it's helpful to chop up some garlic and cook it in chicken stock. Then drink a cup every half hour. It really works! [Person2]:  Ugh!
[Person1]:  you are dressed to kill. You look gorgeous, Alexander. [Person2]:  thanks. This is my power suit. I have a dinner date tonight. [Person1]:  how did you meet each other? [Person2]:  she's a friend of Amy. We met at Amy's birthday party. [Person1]:  is this your first date? [Person2]:  yes. I hope it pans out. Cross your fingers, Lily. [Person1]:  sure it will. Oh, no, it's seven fifteen already. I'm going to be late for my date. [Person2]:  oh. . . so you buried the hatchet with Steven? [Person1]:  absolutely not! He's a cheater. I will never talk to him again. I'm over with him. He's history! [Person2]:  then who will you meet tonight? [Person1]:  a guy I met on the internet three month ago. [Person2]:  really? Are you sure this is a good idea? [Person1]:  please don't be so fussy! I didn't just meet him yesterday. [Person2]:  I know, but remember to meet in a public place and don't give out your personal information.
[Person1]:  I heard that Janet has got a new job. She's working for the united investment group. I heard that they pay very well. [Person2]:  I heard that too. She must be making a pocket. Well, good for her. [Person1]:  Now, she'll be able to save up for that holiday in the united states. [Person2]:  Yes, she will. At the moment, the exchange rate is very favorable, so she should try to go as soon as possible, while it's cheaper. [Person1]:  You're right. By the way, did you hear that Tom inherited some money recently? [Person2]:  Really? I thought his parents had died several years ago. [Person1]:  They did. He inherited the money from an uncle. I hope he doesn't lose a lot of it in taxed to the government. [Person2]:  Dying can be very expensive nowadays! What's he going to do with it? [Person1]:  He said that he would probably invest most of it. He's got a well-paid job, so he doesn't need the money to cover day-to day expenses. He just wants some extra money available for when he retires. [Person2]:  I had some good financial news yesterday too. [Person1]:  Really? Have you won a fortune in the lottery? [Person2]:  No, but I got a pay rise of 5 % and a bonus for all the hard work I'Ve put in recently. I think it was very nice for my boss to show his appreciation in that way. [Person1]:  It certainly was! So, what are you going to do with your windfall?
[Person1]:  What's the area of your country? [Person2]:  It's not very big. It's a little over half a million square kilometers. [Person1]:  That sounds quite big! How many people live there? [Person2]:  There are about 30 million people in my country. Most of them live in the north. [Person1]:  What's the average income? [Person2]:  That's the really hard to say. I think most people earn about two thousand dollars a month, if you convert the money from our currency into dollars. [Person1]:  So your country is fairly rich. [Person2]:  I think we are richer than most countries, but not as rich as countries in western Europe. Our biggest problem at the moment is unemployment, which is roughly 8 %. It has doubled over the last four years. [Person1]:  Unemployment in my country is a fraction of that.
[Person1]:  May I see a hat, please? [Person2]:  What size do you take? [Person1]:  I'm sorry. I don't know. [Person2]:  I'll measure you. . . You take size 6. What colour hat would you like? [Person1]:  Brown, please. [Person2]:  Here are some nice brown hats. Try this hat on. It's a very good one. [Person1]:  Yes, I like this one. It goes very well with my coat. How much is it? [Person2]:  It's $ 9. 95. Do you want me to put it in a box?
[Person1]:  Could you tell me which kind of payment you'll choose? [Person2]:  We're going to pay by check. [Person1]:  Will you please have the check certified? [Person2]:  If you think it is necessary. [Person1]:  It's just our policy. We would accept a certified check or a direct bank remittance. [Person2]:  OK, no problem.
[Person1]:  A  [Person2]:  Well, I just spend 15 minutes as so checking my stock bonds and booking an air ticket for my mother. Anyway, I have done all my work and it is about the time to leave. [Person1]:  Though our company doesn't have a return policy, limiting the personal use of internet, I don't think the boss will like us to do that. [Person2]:  Certainly, work always comes first. [Person1]:  But it is lucky for us. The company computers don't have software keeping tracks of websites we visit. I have shopped too often online these days. [Person2]:  Well, keep a low profile.
[Person1]:  Good morning. This is Monterey Bay Inn. Can I help you? [Person2]:  Good morning. I'm calling to cancel my reservation. [Person1]:  OK. Can you tell me the dates for it? [Person2]:  They are... January 29th through February 1st. [Person1]:  Got it. Er...Would you like to book a room for another day? We have a special deal in March. If you book a room for two days, you can get the third day for free. [Person2]:  I see. I'll consider it later. [Person1]:  Well, there will be two hundred and eighty dollars returned to you. Would you like me to put it back on your Visa? [Person2]:  Yes. Thanks a lot.
[Person1]:  Hi, are you Don? I'm Lynn. I saw the advertisement you put on the Internet about selling your car. [Person2]:  Hi, Lynn. Nice to meet you. Thanks for your interest. Here's my car. It's a 2006 Honda Civic. I took a lot of road trips in it! It is not perfect, but it is safe to drive and it has new tires. [Person1]:  Is anything broken? [Person2]:  The radio is broken and the heater is broken, but the air conditioner works well. [Person1]:  I think you should lower the price because the radio and the heater are broken. If you don't lower the price, I don't think I want to buy it. [Person2]:  Sorry, but I'm not lowering the price. It's a very safe car, even if the radio is broken. Would you like to drive the car so you can see if you like it? [Person1]:  No, thank you. I am worried something else is broken too.
[Person1]:  Have you thought about what you are going to do after finishing school? [Person2]:  Hmm...Where does start? [Person1]:  Well. I think the best way is to start thinking about what jobs you might find interesting. For me, I like jobs of excitement. So I want to be a racing driver. [Person2]:  That's cool, but I think it is dangerous. [Person1]:  It is also my father's job and I'm going to ask him about it some more. Now, what about you? [Person2]:  Hmm...I love to be outdoors. Also I would like to help people in some way. [Person1]:  Well. Firefighters often work outdoors and help others. But such a job is in suitable for women. [Person2]:  Yeah, uh, the job of a tour guide has actually been attractive to me. [Person1]:  That sounds like a suitable job for you.
[Person1]:  This line is so long. [Person2]:  Yes. It was a quarter past seven when we began to wait and we have already been waiting for half an hour. [Person1]:  I guess they're doing a really thorough check. [Person2]:  What are they checking for? [Person1]:  They need to make sure no one is carrying any weapons. [Person2]:  I'm glad they checked only for that. Or it will surely be longer. [Person1]:  They also have to make sure no one has drugs. [Person2]:  Wow. I guess that's why the police dogs are here. [Person1]:  Yes. Look. There are only 3 people ahead. [Person2]:  After that, can we board the bus? [Person1]:  Yes. We're almost there. [Person2]:  Good.
[Person1]:  Hi, Lily, what a surprise to see you here! Aren't you on a holiday with Mike in Paris now? [Person2]:  Sorry, I'm not Lily. I'm her sister Lucy. [Person1]:  Gosh, you two really look like each other. Are you twins? [Person2]:  Yes. She is 20 minutes older than me. [Person1]:  It must be interesting to have a twin sister. [Person2]:  Well, not so interesting. We have to share almost everything. So are you a friend of Lily's? [Person1]:  We're just in the same class. Are you seeing anyone off here? [Person2]:  In fact, I'm taking a flight to Beijing. I like traveling. What about you? [Person1]:  I came with a friend. She's going to New Zealand for her summer holiday.
[Person1]:  Hello, welcome to Lincoln Bank. What can we do for you today? [Person2]:  I want to effect payment under an L / C today. [Person1]:  No problem. OK... just checking for you. Ah, I'm afraid there aren't enough funds in your account to cover this transaction. What you can do is buy some US dollars, using local currency and we can credit your account with that amount. [Person2]:  That seems alright. What's the exchange rate like today? Good or bad? [Person1]:  It's not too bad today, actually. 828.23.
[Person1]:  Susan, I've got a few questions. Let's see. Can you type? [Person2]:  No,I can't type. [Person1]:  What about shorthand? [Person2]:  I don't know. I've never tried. [Person1]:  So you can't take shorthand and you can't type. What can you do, may I ask? [Person2]:  Well, I can play the piano and the violin. [Person1]:  Play the piano and the violin? [Person2]:  Yes, and I can sing and dance. [Person1]:  Susan, what are you doing here? [Person2]:  I want a job. I want to work here. [Person1]:  But you can't take shorthand, and you can't even type. [Person2]:  No, of course I can't. I'm an actress. [Person1]:  But I want a secretary. [Person2]:  Is this the Grand Theater? [Person1]:  No, of course not. It's the Grand Hotel. The Grand Theater is on the opposite street.
[Person1]:  There are something wrong with my computer. [Person2]:  Really, what's wrong with it? [Person1]:  The computer doesn't work when I push the power cotton. [Person2]:  Oh, do you use your computer often? [Person1]:  Yes, I don't know why it doesn't work this time. [Person2]:  Don't worry. Have you got receipt with you? [Person1]:  Yeah! [Person2]:  We'll go to your house and repair it on Tuesday. Ok? [Person1]:  OK, I'll expected you around 2 o'clock? [Person2]:  See you then.
[Person1]:  Have you finished your work? [Person2]:  Not because I'm keeping an eye on the baby. [Person1]:  Where is the baby's mother? [Person2]:  She is at the supermarket downstairs. She said she would be back in about half an hour.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, Professor. I have to talk to you about why my homework didn't get done. [Person2]:  What happened that you didn't get it done? [Person1]:  I had to watch a football game instead. [Person2]:  Well, you had more than one day ; couldn't you have fit it in on another day? [Person1]:  Yes, I think so. [Person2]:  Either way, I only allow one missed assignment per semester. When will you be turning the make-up in? [Person1]:  I'll make it up next week. [Person2]:  Fine, but it cannot happen again if you want an ' A ' in the class. [Person1]:  OK, I can do that. [Person2]:  Remember that you are in college now, not high school.
[Person1]:  What's the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend? [Person2]:  We are going to climb a cliff on the Yangtze River. [Person1]:  How hard is the climb? [Person2]:  It is a very difficult climb, because there are not many places to put your hands and feet. [Person1]:  What did you do last week? [Person2]:  We rappelled down the side of a 300 - foot cliff. It's very exciting. [Person1]:  Wow. That sounds like a lot of fun. I am sorry I missed it. [Person2]:  Well, you should come this weekend. I think you could do the climb. [Person1]:  Yeah, I will. See you then! [Person2]:  Ok, see you.
[Person1]:  Is it your first time to join the sports meeting of Junior High School?  [Person2]:  Yes, and it's great. What are the events at the sports meeting?  [Person1]:  Long-distance race, dash, hurdle race, relay race, standing long jump, high jump, shotput and so on.  [Person2]:  Our neighbor, Bruce, will take part in the relay race. Let's go have a look.  [Person1]:  OK, let's go.  [Person2]:  The competition will begin in 5 minutes, it's tense here.  [Person1]:  Wonderful, Bruce is taking the lead.  [Person2]:  Other competitors have almost caught up with him. They are neck and neck.  [Person1]:  Come on, Bruce. Come on, Bruce.  [Person2]:  Wow, Bruce crossed the line first. 
[Person1]:  Good morning, sir. Can I help you? [Person2]:  Yes, I'd like to see the manager. Here's my card. [Person1]:  Thank you, Mr. Wang. Do you have an appointment? [Person2]:  No, I'm afraid I don't. Is it possible for me to see him now? [Person1]:  I'm afraid Mr. Li is engaged at the moment. Would you mind waiting? [Person2]:  Well, how long will it be? [Person1]:  About half an hour. [Person2]:  That's too bad. I can't wait that long. I have another appointment at ten. [Person1]:  Can the Assistant Manager meet you instead? [Person2]:  No, I have discussed the details about sales of our new equipment with the manager on the telephone yesterday. [Person1]:  Do you want to make another appointment? [Person2]:  Yes, I suppose that's the best thing I can do for now. I'll be here on Thursday morning at 10 o'clock. Is that all right? [Person1]:  Yes, I'll make a note of that and ask Mr. Li to confirm.
[Person1]:  I'm going to the shops in a minute. What do we need? [Person2]:  We're okay for vegetables but we should stock up on meat. Can you go to the butcher's and get some veal and some beef? [Person1]:  No problem. We also need bread, so I'll go to the baker's. I'll get some vol au vents for Victor's birthday bash on Friday. We'll need balloons for that too. [Person2]:  Better visit the supermarket then. We'll need some other things for the party. Get some vanilla ice cream, some butter and some vinegar and twelve bottles of beer. [Person1]:  Okay. The library's beside the baker's. I'd better take back the videos we borrowed last week. They're overdue. [Person2]:  I'll see you later then. [Person1]:  Bye! I'll be back before seven.
[Person1]:  Please come in, Steven. [Person2]:  All right, Mr. Green. [Person1]:  Have a seat over there. How are things going out in the office? [Person2]:  Pretty well. Everyone is working hard. [Person1]:  But, our business has been going down sharply the couple of months and we have to reduce some staff. [Person2]:  You mean I'm among the people who have to go? [Person1]:  I'm afraid so. [Person2]:  Did I do something wrong? [Person1]:  You're the sales manager, but our sales didn't go up. [Person2]:  But you know I've been working very hard. And I have a family to support. [Person1]:  I feel sorry, but that's the decision of the directorate.
[Person1]:  Sara, I've been looking forward to our yearly camp out for three weeks. [Me too] It's going to be a wonderful day for hiking tomorrow. The great outdoors. Camping under the stars. This is the life. [Person2]:  Yeah, but Paul, I'm a little bit worried about the weather though. The weatherman said it was going to rain later tonight. [Person1]:  Ah, nonsense. Nothing can spoil our adventure. Those weather reports are never right. [Person2]:  And it said there was a chance of high winds. [Person1]:  Ah. Don't worry. [Person2]:  [thunder] Paul. Paul. Did you remember to bring our raincoats just in case, like I told you? [light rain] [Person1]:  Uh ... no. I left them on the front porch. [heavy rain] [Person2]:  What are we going to do now? [Person1]:  We'll have to sleep in the car! Hurry get in! [door shut] [Person2]:  So, Paul, what are we going to do now? [Person1]:  How about playing a card game? [Person2]:  Uhh. I left them next to the picnic table. [Hmmm] Hey, you don't want me to go out in this rain and get them, do you? [Person1]:  No. That's okay. So what now? [Person2]:  Well, we could head down the mountain and stay at that hotel we passed on the way up, or go home. [Person1]:  Hmm, why don't we just make the best of it here and hope the weather clears. [Person2]:  That's a good idea.
[Person1]:  It seems the restaurants here have little business these days. [Person2]:  That's true. But ours is a scenic resort. And this is not the busy season. When summer comes, you'll see armies of tourists waiting in line in order to get a seat.
[Person1]:  Our guest today is Alas Baker who has a very unusual ability. Alas, thank you for coming into the studio. What kind of unusual ability are we talking about here? [Person2]:  Wow, it's quite easy to describe. Basically, when I read a word or even think of a particular word, such as Tuesday, I see a color connected with it. It's not that I imagine a color. I really see it loading in front of my eyes. [Person1]:  How interesting! Is it a sort of medical condition? [Person2]:  Yes. And just recently doctors have begun to understand it more. They call it synesthesia, which means that somewhere in my brain, there are links between sections that should really be separate. Other people have a form of this condition that affects emotions. So they see colors when they feel particular emotions. Apparently, it's generally passed on from parents to their children, which is the case with me. [Person1]:  Do you have any brothers or sisters with the same ability? [Person2]:  Yes, my brother is the same as me. If we start talking about it, people think we are completely mad. When we were younger, we used to have arguments about things like what color the word Tuesday is. It turns out that everyone with this condition sees different colors. [Person1]:  It sounds as though it could make life quite exhausting. [Person2]:  I suppose it does. But you see, if you've never known anything different, you don't think of it like that. It does make you aware of your moods. I know when I started to feel depressed, things begin to look grey. [Person1]:  Are there any other advantages do you find? [Person2]:  Well, it seems that quite a lot of artists and musicians have this condition. So I guess it can be beneficial if it's combined with some sort of gift or natural talent, which is not the case with me unfortunately. But I do find that it makes reading very interesting, because sometimes a sentence has a very nice range of colors. So you want to read it again just to experience that. Of course, this makes me quite a slow reader.
[Person1]:  Why are you walking to and fro in the room?  [Person2]:  I'm worrying about the children. After all this is the first time they have been out without us.  [Person1]:  Don't worry. They are grown-ups.  [Person2]:  I know. But I couldn't help. 
[Person1]:  Have a look at these brochures! Have you ever thought of visiting North Africa? [Person2]:  Well, I've traveled to Morocco on business twice and I'd really like to go there again on holiday. [Person1]:  Great. There is a flight on April twenty fifth and... [Person2]:  Flight? Forget it! My wife is afraid of flying. [Person1]:  Oh, in that case how about traveling by ship? [Person2]:  Sorry I get sea sick when I travel by ship. [Person1]:  Then North Africa is out of the question. [Person2]:  I guess so. What else can you suggest? [Person1]:  What about a coach tour around Europe? It includes different countries and it's quite cheap. [Person2]:  OK, that's probably the best idea.
[Person1]:  I can't believe Thanksgiving is right around the corner. Who usually does the cooking in your family? [Person2]:  My mother and my 2 aunts don't let anyone else do anything except for the salad and the drinks. That includes all the sauces, desserts and place settings. [Person1]:  Wow, it sounds like they take Turkey day pretty seriously. [Person2]:  Listen, if Thanksgiving were an Olympic sport, they would be kicked out for winning too many gold medals. What about you? [Person1]:  Well, my parents and I do everything together. It's better than one person trying to do too much.
[Person1]:  Sophie, did you see that quiz show last night, the one presented by Frank Jones? [Person2]:  No, was it any good? [Person1]:  It was great. Frank Jones always makes me laugh. I've been watching it for the past couple of weeks. [Person2]:  Do you think so? I don't understand why so many people think he's funny. [Person1]:  Well, you're the fifth or sixth person I've told to see it. Some of my friends thought it was going to be too serious, so they didn't bother watching it. [Person2]:  So are all the questions really easy and just about pop music or movie stars? I'm not interested in watching it if all the questions are like that. [Person1]:  Actually, they start off a bit easy, but they get harder and harder as the show goes on. [Person2]:  Usually I'm not bad at general knowledge questions, especially ones about history or literature. [Person1]:  Yeah, but I'm better at math and science.
[Person1]:  Excuse me? I want to go to Broadway on Eighty-second Sreet. Can I take any bus that comes along? [Person2]:  You can take any bus except the No.9. [Person1]:  How often do the buses run? [Person2]:  They run about every 5 minutes. [Person1]:  Fine. How long does it take to get to Eighty-second Street? [Person2]:  About 15 minutes. It's not very far. Are you a stranger here? [Person1]:  Yes, I am. [Person2]:  How do you like New York? [Person1]:  I like it very much. The weather, the lifestyle, but the way people talk here is a little confusing to me. It's hard to understand. [Person2]:  You'll soon get accustomed to it. It's not that difficult. Well, here's the bus. Fortunately, it's not full. [Person1]:  Thanks for your help. You're really nice.
[Person1]:  OK, just sign your name right here on this line and you will officially own your house. [Person2]:  Excellent. I can't believe I just bought a house. I've waited such a long time to own a house. When can I move in? [Person1]:  The previous owners need to clean the house this weekend. But you can move in on Monday morning. Do you have the keys? [Person2]:  No, I don't have the keys. Can I pick them up from your office tomorrow? [Person1]:  My office isn't open on Fridays, but I can bring them to you this weekend. Do you have all the copies of these important papers? [Person2]:  Yes, I have a question. Do you sell houses in Springfield too? My friend wants to sell his house and I'd love to recommend you. You were great to work with. [Person1]:  Yes, I do. Thanks for the recommendation.
[Person1]:  What do you think about this idea? Going for a picnic. [Person2]:  Well, I'm not sure, I think it's a bit boring. I think barbecue on the beach would be more fun. [Person1]:  Yes, I agree, but it's quite a lot of work. Someone has to stand here and cook all night. I think we should go to a restaurant instead. [Person2]:  That's true, but it's quite expensive to go to a restaurant. [Person1]:  Well, what about having a party at someone's house? We could order a pizza or just some hamburgers. [Person2]:  I suppose so, I think a fancy dress party is a good idea. We could have a competition and decide who is wearing the best clothes. [Person1]:  You are right. I think that's the best idea, too.
[Person1]:  You are saying he will be promoted to the general manager?  [Person2]:  Yeah.  [Person1]:  Are you sure?  [Person2]:  Yes. I bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted.  [Person1]:  Just because he gets on well with everybody?  [Person2]:  Partly, and he's also a hard working man. 
[Person1]:  I'm ready to place an order with you, but only one condition that the goods are confined to Australia. Can you do that? [Person2]:  Well, I haven't made such arrangements with the factory yet. So I'd like to make sure if it is acceptable to the factory before making a commitment to you. [Person1]:  All right, but I'm busy. How long will it be before you can finish the talk? [Person2]:  I won't be too long, I suppose. Just let me ring them, will you? [Person1]:  Go ahead. [Person2]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  May I see your passport, please? [Person2]:  Certainly. Here it is. [Person1]:  You are here on business, I think? [Person2]:  That's right. A German company has invited me for business talks. [Person1]:  How long will you be staying? [Person2]:  Just two weeks. [Person1]:  How many pieces of baggage have you got? [Person2]:  Only one. In this case, I have a camera. [Person1]:  Do you intend to take it out on your departure? [Person2]:  Yes, I do. [Person1]:  According to the regulations, the camera you've brought along for personal use can be passed for the time being duty free, but you will have to take it out with you when you leave the country. [Person2]:  I will. [Person1]:  Well. Have a pleasant stay in Germany. [Person2]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  Do you know that scientists replicated a sheep into an identical clone. [Person2]:  I heard about that. It was successful. [Person1]:  It's a big jump in science. Maybe more like a leap. [Person2]:  I should say, it stunned me. I can't imagine what they will think of next.
[Person1]:  Let's call it a day. [Person2]:  It's nice to go home earlier once in a while. But it's the evening rush. [Person1]:  It's hard to commute a long way. [Person2]:  Sure it is. I really hate to get caught in a traffic jam.
[Person1]:  Are you still at that work? [Person2]:  Yes, I'm still working there. But I really find my job boring. I'd like to change my job. [Person1]:  What sort of job do you have in mind? [Person2]:  I think I'm quite fit for a driver. [Person1]:  But it's very tired. [Person2]:  I don't care. [Person1]:  What's your parents'opinion? [Person2]:  I haven't told them. Maybe I'll make them know after the vacation.
[Person1]:  How did you get around over there? Did you rent cars? [Person2]:  No, that would be too expensive. We used the train system. We bought a special pass called a Enrail pass. It lets people use the train wherever they want, as often as they want. [Person1]:  I've heard about Enrail passes. So those Europeans really depend on trains a lot. [Person2]:  Yes, they do. I wish we Americans had a better train system. [Person1]:  I know. Our train system is lousy. And besides, Americans love their cars too much. [Person2]:  I agree. And probably the automobile companies are too powerful. They never allowed the government to develop trains. [Person1]:  It's too bad for the environment. So much pollution from cars. [Person2]:  Americans love cars for different reasons, I think. One reason is that we are very individualistic. And cars are a very individual way of getting around. Americans like the freedom of driving around by themselves. They don't want to ride in a train or bus with a group of people. [Person1]:  Yes, I agree. I think it is a cultural characteristic. It would be very hard to get us Americans to change this. But you know what? Probably, in the future, Americans will have to change. [Person2]:  Why do you say ' have to '? [Person1]:  Because the earth's environment can't tolerate cars forever. I think cars are already causing global warming. When the problem gets more serious, world governments will have to start limiting car use. [Person2]:  Maybe you're right. They will have to develop alternative transportation. But it will be hard in America. Too many people are used to cars. Even in our movies cars are very important. [Person1]:  Wow! I didn't notice the time. It's almost noon. I have to get home. [Person2]:  Do you want me to give you a ride? [Person1]:  No, no problem. I have my car in the parking ramp around the corner. [Person2]:  Alright. Well, I'll stay here and have another coffee. Nice running into you. [Person1]:  See you around.
[Person1]:  Hi, waiting for the bus? Where are you going? [Person2]:  China Hotel. [Person1]:  Why don't you take a taxi? It'll get you there much faster. [Person2]:  Well, I think I'll take the bus this time just for a change.
[Person1]:  Hello. Is Vanessa there? [Person2]:  Yes. This is Vanessa. [Person1]:  Hi, Vanessa. I'm Don. I'm calling from Seller's Market. Are you still interested in a position as a cashier? [Person2]:  Yes. Is the position available now? [Person1]:  Yes, it is. Please come to see me tomorrow afternoon at 2 00 for a job interview. [Person2]:  Thanks a lot. [Person1]:  You're welcome. I'll see you tomorrow at 2 00. [Person2]:  I'll see you then. Good bye.
[Person1]:  We look forward to your early reply and trust that through our mutual cooperation we shall be able to conclude this transaction with you in the near future. [Person2]:  Thank you for your consideration. We will inform you of our intention as soon as possible. [Person1]:  I hope you'll see that we are really doing our utmost.
[Person1]:  Have you gone to school today? [Person2]:  I went to school today. Did you go to school? [Person1]:  I couldn't go to school today, I was sick. [Person2]:  That's horrible. I'd be happy to give you the assignments from English class. [Person1]:  Thank you very much, that's kind of you. [Person2]:  Don't mention it. [Person1]:  When you miss a day of school, I'll be happy to give you the English assignments. [Person2]:  That is greatly appreciated and I hope you feel well enough to go to school tomorrow.
[Person1]:  Congratulations. You certainly did quite well and I must say you deserve that grade. [Person2]:  Well, I really studied hard for that exam I've been preparing for it for more than a month. Now, I can relax for a while.
[Person1]:  Is your mother feeling any better these days? [Person2]:  Much better. She should be back home in a few days. [Person1]:  That sounds like the operation was successful? [Person2]:  Yeah, and the doctors say she will recover soon. [Person1]:  That's wonderful. When will you be back on your job? [Person2]:  I think I need at least one more week to take care of her and do some cleaning. [Person1]:  Why don't you hire someone to do it? Then, you can come back to your job, and you need more free time to have a rest as well. [Person2]:  Yes, thank you. I really do need it. But I'm worried about my mother. She is 72 years old. [Person1]:  You are a kind and thoughtful person. Please take good care of her. [Person2]:  Thank you, Mary. How about my work? [Person1]:  Don't worry about it; all of us in our office can help you with it these days. I hope your mother to recover soon. [Person2]:  It's very kind of you. Thank you very much.
[Person1]:  Hi, Bill, you look happy. [Person2]:  Yes, I've just seen a very funny film on TV. [Person1]:  What was it about? [Person2]:  It was about a careless man who got into trouble wherever he went. He couldn't do anything right. [Person1]:  So you like it? [Person2]:  Yes, I do. It made me laugh a lot. [Person1]:  But I'd rather see something not only interesting but also instructive. [Person2]:  Oh, Jane, don't be so serious. People sometimes need relaxation. [Person1]:  That's true. But I just think that watching TV is not just for entertainment.
[Person1]:  I am so busy today.  [Person2]:  Can I help you?  [Person1]:  I'm not sure. Perhaps you could do the shopping.  [Person2]:  I'll be glad to help.  [Person1]:  Or maybe make the beds.  [Person2]:  All you have to do is ask for help.  [Person1]:  Thanks. That's terrific!  [Person2]:  I'm ready and willing to help. 
[Person1]:  Hi Bob, how's business?  [Person2]:  Just okay.  [Person1]:  Okay, enough small talk. Let's get down to business.  [Person2]:  Good idea.  [Person1]:  Since we're good friends, you don't have to pay me.  [Person2]:  No, I can't accept it. Business is business. 
[Person1]:  Would you like to go to the zoo? [Person2]:  Yes, of course. I like to give all the animals names like birth, the giraffe. But I wish the animals didn't have to be in the zoo. I think it is good when zoos save animals and help make their populations grow. [Person1]:  Yeah, they can do some good things definitely. Uh, what is your favorite animal? [Person2]:  My favorite animal? Oh, let me think. I love rabbits, besides I'd pick the coolest animal the monkey. [Person1]:  The monkey? [Person2]:  Yeah. [Person1]:  There are a lot of monkeys in Japan. Have you ever seen a monkey in the wild? [Person2]:  No, but my brother is a wild monkey.
[Person1]:  Hello, Mr. Hammer. Jack Ross here. I'm calling to confirm our appointment on Monday at ten o'clock in your office. [Person2]:  Yes. Everything's all set. [Person1]:  I'd like to bring Mr. Huang and Ms. Sun with me. [Person2]:  We're supposed to be meeting alone. [Person1]:  I know, but I think they may add something valuable to the discussion. [Person2]:  Fine. But no one else, OK? [Person1]:  Yes, Mr. Hammer.
[Person1]:  Earning extra income on the Internet is easier than you might think. After I started selling traditional craft items on the Internet last year, I have really been able to make bank doing something I love. [Person2]:  Is that right? I hear all these horror stories of internet business crashing because there is not enough of a customer base yet. How can you be sure your idea will cash in? [Person1]:  To run a successful internet business, it requires a little research and relatively small investment. You've got to have a good idea of some kind of product that is in demand or would be popular. [Person2]:  That's marketing research. . . But what about getting started once you have an idea? [Person1]:  After you have your great idea, then you can set up shop by registering a domain name, creating a website, an email address, and a hosting service. If you want to go all out on your website, you can put together shopping cart technology, but that can be pricey to start out with. [Person2]:  Sounds like a lot of work! [Person1]:  Anything worth doing takes work. Money doesn't grow on trees. . . Most of us have to work for it.
[Person1]:  You're watching TV again Peter. [Person2]:  I have washed all the bowls and plates. [Person1]:  But you haven't watered the flowers or fed the birds. [Person2]:  I'm sorry. I forgot, I will do it now. [Person1]:  Your dad just did that for you. [Person2]:  Oh that was really nice of him. Well mom, I turned on the TV only because I want to know the result of the game between Manchester United and Manchester City. [Person1]:  Why didn't you just search online? [Person2]:  My computer isn't working. [Person1]:  Didn't you turn it off after you finished your homework? [Person2]:  Oh that's right. I forgot. No wonder!
[Person1]:  Jim is a genius. He gets along well with everybody and he can always get the work done. [Person2]:  A boss likes him a lot. He says Jim is a good team player. [Person1]:  Everybody would like to have Jim on their team. Because he is funny and helpful and he can contribute a lot to the team he belongs to. [Person2]:  Maybe we all should learn something from him. [Person1]:  Right.
[Person1]:  Have any plans for the weekend, Tom? [Person2]:  Yes. I am going for a hike around the Qinghai Lake. [Person1]:  Oh, do you go hiking often? [Person2]:  I go as much as I can. I love hiking, because you can really get in touch with nature. [Person1]:  It would be nice to get out of the city. Do you want some company? [Person2]:  Sure. But it will be a long hike 30 miles in three days. Have you been hiking before? [Person1]:  Yeah, I go a lot too. I saw a bear and a lion on my last hike. [Person2]:  Wow. You must have been pretty far away from the city. [Person1]:  Yeah, my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest. [Person2]:  Well, bring him along to. We will have a great time this weekend. [Person1]:  Thanks. I will ask him.
[Person1]:  Have you ever been to Britain? [Person2]:  Oh yes, I'Ve been to Britain many times. I go there on business. [Person1]:  Really? How often do you go there? [Person2]:  Usually, I go to London twice a year but sometimes I go three or four times a year. [Person1]:  Do you always go on business or do you sometimes go for a holiday? [Person2]:  I'm afraid I never go for a holiday. It's always business.
[Person1]:  So here are your four ticket sir, is there anything else I can do for you? [Person2]:  Yes, I was wondering if I could get regular information about what's on? [Person1]:  Certainly, I can add your name to our mailing list. Would that be ok? [Person2]:  That would be very good. Yes, please. Oh, and there is something else, sorry one of our group is hard of hearing and I heard that you can supply special headphones? [Person1]:  That's right, as long as you tell us in advance, we can always do that. I'll book those for you now, and you can just collect them here tomorrow before the show. [Person2]:  Thanks very much for your help. [Person1]:  No problem.
[Person1]:  Why you don't like going to the cinema? [Person2]:  Well, there are too many problems. For example, when a film is popular, the cinema is rather crowded. [Person1]:  Is that all? [Person2]:  No, the worst is the people - children running up and down, people chatting endlessly, and so on. So, I'd rather stay home and wait to see the films when they are shown on TV. [Person1]:  Then you may see the films a bit later than other people. [Person2]:  Yes, but I'll be more comfortable in the quietness of my living room. [Person1]:  Well, I prefer seeing films at the cinema as soon as they come out.
[Person1]:  I can't give you a tour now I'm afraid. I have to stay here at the help desk since all the other librarians are very busy now. But I can show you a few places in the library here on this map. [Person2]:  That would be helpful. [Person1]:  OK. So we are here at the help desk, next to the service desk, where you go to borrow and return books. You can borrow up to 10 books each time. [Person2]:  Yes, I see. [Person1]:  Opposite the service desk is the training room, which is used by library staff to give training to staff and students on how to use the computer systems. The entrance to that room is round the other side. [Person2]:  Is the training room beside the quiet room? [Person1]:  Yes, that's right, with that entrance round the front too. It's important to remember that all mobile phones must be switched off in the quiet room. [Person2]:  Of course, and what about books? Where can I find the books for my geography course? [Person1]:  If you walk past the service desk, turn right...no, sorry, turn left, and continue on past the history section and biology section, you'll find the geography section. You should be able to find all the books you need there.
[Person1]:  Was that the telephone ringing? [Person2]:  I didn't hear anything. [Person1]:  I thought I heard it ring 2 or 3 times. [Person2]:  Sometimes when the windows are open, you can hear the neighbor's phone. [Person1]:  Well, I'm expecting an important phone call and I don't want to miss it.
[Person1]:  Dear, have you bought the drinks for the children? [Person2]:  I'm going to the post office later. I'll go to the supermarket on the way home and get some. I don't think we need anything else, do we? [Person1]:  Well, I'm not sure we have enough food. You know my cousins always eat everything when they come round? [Person2]:  That's ok, I think we've got everything we need. [Person1]:  Good, if you could get started with the housework now. I'll get started with the cooking. I don't want to leave everything until the last minute. [Person2]:  Well, there isn't much to do actually, I cleaned and tidied the living room this morning. Oh, and remember, you'll have to collect my mom from the train station tomorrow. My car is in the garage. [Person1]:  Don't worry. I haven't forgotten.
[Person1]:  What are you guys doing? [Person2]:  Can't you see? We're making paper airplanes. [Person1]:  Yeah, I see that, but what are you doing with them? [Person2]:  We're flying them, of course. [Person1]:  Out of the window? [Person2]:  Yeah. [Person1]:  That isn't right. You shouldn't throw paper out of the window near the land on the street and someone will have to pick it up. You're just making the street dirtier than it already is. [Person2]:  No, we aren't. First of all, we're not throwing the airplanes out. We're making them fly. And second, most of our planes aren't going on the street. [Person1]:  Where are they going? [Person2]:  See that building across the street from us? We are sending them on to the roof of that building. We've already gotten more than 50 on there. [Person1]:  You're going to get in trouble. [Person2]:  Only if you tell mom and dad.
[Person1]:  Nice to see you Alice, come in, please. [Person2]:  Thank you Tom, but I am afraid not now, I come only to return the book borrowed from you. [Person1]:  Wonderful I've been waiting for you a long time and longing to know, what you think of it? [Person2]:  It is very interesting and I've learned a lot from it. [Person1]:  Well, so it is with me. [Person2]:  Oh sorry, I can't go on talking about it with you any longer. [Person1]:  It doesn't matter, better stay here for another 10 minutes. [Person2]:  No, I'll go and buy some food in the shop, and I have to say goodbye to you. [Person1]:  Goodbye.
[Person1]:  How may I help you? [Person2]:  I ' m making a deposit today. [Person1]:  Cash or check? [Person2]:  I would like to deposit a check. [Person1]:  You need to sign the back. [Person2]:  Okay. Here you go. [Person1]:  Would you like cash back? [Person2]:  Yes, I would. [Person1]:  How much? [Person2]:  Let me get $ 150 back. [Person1]:  Here you go. [Person2]:  Thank you. Have a good one.
[Person1]:  hey, the new SOHO. How's everything going? [Person2]:  everything's great. I've just returned from my office. [Person1]:  your office? Aren't you a freelancer? [Person2]:  sure I am. I work for myself, but I've rented a virtual office at an office building in the downtown area. [Person1]:  a virtual office? [Person2]:  yeah, an office that runs efficiently by using nothing other than online communication technologies. I pay the rent and share office services with others in the same building. [Person1]:  what kind of services do they offer? [Person2]:  a separated office, internet access, phone services, fax services, mail & courier services, and almost everything you have in a conventional office. [Person1]:  sounds fun. what else? [Person2]:  I get a business address at an expensive location, and I can share the receptionist and secretary with other offices in the same floor. [Person1]:  oh, that helps a lot to promote your corporate image. [Person2]:  you bet it!
[Person1]:  Hello, Mary. What's the matter with you? You look upset. [Person2]:  My friend and I was argued with each other. For this, I'm very sad. Because I don't want to lose this friend. [Person1]:  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how you feel. Please don't be sad. [Person2]:  Thank you, but I really want to relax myself. I'm very sorry. [Person1]:  OK. Don't let it get to you. Goodbye.
[Person1]:  Hello, I've got a letter here that I'd like to post. [Person2]:  Yes, where's it to, madam? [Person1]:  Well, the letter is going to a friend of mine in America and it's quite urgent. It really needs to be posted today, so here you are. [Person2]:  You want to send it airmail, madam? [Person1]:  I do want to send it airmail, yes.
[Person1]:  Is this the Friendship Hospital? Please send an ambulance to 68 Hu Nan Road. [Person2]:  Is it urgent? Our ambulances are not enough to meet every call. [Person1]:  Of course. It's urgent. I think the partient is suffering from acute appendicitis. He may die if not treated in time. [Person2]:  All right, we'll come right away. [Person1]:  Thank you. [Person2]:  Where's the patient? [Person1]:  He's there in the room. He's very ill. [Person2]:  Don't worry. We'll put him in the stretcher. You are coming with us? Step in please. [Person1]:  Carry him into the emergency ward. Here we are. [Person2]:  Help the patient bathe and change his clothes, nurse. Then bring him into the operating room. [Person1]:  I'm his guide. What's the trouble with him, doctor [Person2]:  He had appendicitis, but is all right now that it was removed. He'll have to rest for a few weeks to recover. [Person1]:  May I send food for him? [Person2]:  No, outside food is not permitted. [Person1]:  Can I come round to see him tomorrow? [Person2]:  Yes. But first you must observe the visiting hours, It's from 2 to 5 p. m. By the way, consult the nurse before you enter the ward. [Person1]:  Yes. Thank you. [Person2]:  By the way, you can bring some flowers. [Person1]:  OK. [Person2]:  Don't worry about him. [Person1]:  When could I take care of him? [Person2]:  Our nurse can take good care of him.
[Person1]:  So, Casey, how are things going with the photos for the press kit? [Person2]:  Yeah, I'Ve been meaning to talk to you about that. I might need to ask for an extension on that deadline. [Person1]:  You'Ve had over a month to get this finalized! Why are things delayed? [Person2]:  Well, the thing is, we ran into a lot of problems. . . [Person1]:  I'm not looking for excuses here. I just want to get this finished on time! [Person2]:  I know, and I apologize for the delay. But some things were just beyond my control. I had trouble booking the photographer, and then Michael was sick for three weeks, so I couldn't include him in the photos, and the design team lost all the files, so I had to re-do the pictures. [Person1]:  I'm not going to put this off any longer, Casey! I want those photos ASAP!
[Person1]:  Are you going to vote? [Person2]:  I am so excited to be voting. [Person1]:  Do you know who you're going to vote for? [Person2]:  I am so impressed with the candidate I'm going to vote for. [Person1]:  What's so great about him? [Person2]:  I feel that he is very intelligent. [Person1]:  Oh, really? [Person2]:  Yes, and I agree with all his policies. [Person1]:  That's good to hear. [Person2]:  I think this man is going to be the next President. [Person1]:  I hope so. [Person2]:  I'm going to make sure and get my vote in.
[Person1]:  Shouldn't you already be in bed? [Person2]:  I can't sleep. I'm really not all that tired. [Person1]:  You need to get some rest, as you have to get up early in the morning. [Person2]:  It's impossible for me to get to sleep right now. [Person1]:  Just close your eyes, and try not to think. [Person2]:  That really does not work for me. [Person1]:  It doesn't matter, you need to get some sleep. [Person2]:  How about I tire myself out, and then fall asleep when I'm tired? [Person1]:  Then you're not going to go to sleep. [Person2]:  Don't worry, I'll make sure and get to sleep in a little while. [Person1]:  I want you in bed, right now, so sweet dreams. [Person2]:  Fine. Sleep well yourself.
[Person1]:  Hi. How can I help you? [Person2]:  I'm looking for a job. Are you hiring? [Person1]:  Yes, we are. What position are you looking for? [Person2]:  Superintendent. [Person1]:  I'm sorry. The application for this position has closed. [Person2]:  Do you have any other positions available? [Person1]:  We have only one position open. [Person2]:  What is it? [Person1]:  Gas Meter Reader. This is a wonderful job for the right person, regular hours, no night shifts, no supervisor behind you, and good pay. [Person2]:  Can I apply for it right now? [Person1]:  Sure.
[Person1]:  Okay, now I'd like to find out more about your last job. I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly, is that right? [Person2]:  Yes, that's right. To be honest, the first year was quite tough for me. I was really just treated more like an intern. I didn't have many responsibilities and I found it quite frustrating. [Person1]:  So, what changed? [Person2]:  Well slowly but surely I proved myself, and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer. [Person1]:  Wow, a real step up! [Person2]:  Yes, I was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly. I spent 3 years in that position, but to be honest it wasn't an area of journalism I wanted to stay in long-term. [Person1]:  I see, so why did you decide to leave finally? [Person2]:  I just felt that the paper couldn't offer me any new opportunities. I really needed a more challenging role to be honest.
[Person1]:  How many people are there in your family? [Person2]:  My immediate family is quite small. It's just my older step-brother, my mom, my step-dad and me. How about you? [Person1]:  I have a large family. I have three older sisters, my twin sister, a younger brother, and my parents. [Person2]:  I didn't know you were a twin! Are you identical or fraternal? [Person1]:  We're identical. I mean, we look exactly the same, but we complete opposites when it comes to everything else! [Person2]:  Interesting. It must be great having a twin sister. Are you best friends, too? [Person1]:  We used to be really close, but that all changed once she moved to Shanghai. How about your family? You didn't mention to your biological father. [Person2]:  I don't know much about him. He died when I was just a baby. Even though I don't have a blood relationship with my step-father and step-brother, I consider them to be my real family. [Person1]:  What about your step-brother's mother? Does he keep in touch with her? [Person2]:  No, she also died when my step-brother was little. My mother and my step-father met each other shortly after my father died and became good friends. They ended up getting married a few years later. [Person1]:  Sounds like it was ment to be.
[Person1]:  Next time you buy veggies or fruits, have them bagged and weighed before you come here. [Person2]:  Sorry. I didn't know. [Person1]:  The total comes to US $ 65. 81. How will you pay today? [Person2]:  I'm going to use my ATM card. [Person1]:  Slide your card through the card ID pad and punch in your PIN. [Person2]:  Done. [Person1]:  One moment. Do you want to withdraw some cash while you're at it? [Person2]:  No, thanks. [Person1]:  Paper or plastic? [Person2]:  Pardon me? [Person1]:  Do you want paper or plastic bags for your groceries? [Person2]:  Paper, please.
[Person1]:  I think I'm going to go to the market today. [Person2]:  Do we need food? [Person1]:  Yeah, I think so. [Person2]:  What are you going to get? [Person1]:  I'm not sure what we need. [Person2]:  Maybe you should go and look in the refrigerator. [Person1]:  Could you do it for me, and write out a list of things that we need? [Person2]:  Just get the basics. [Person1]:  Like what? [Person2]:  You know. Get some eggs, milk, and bread. [Person1]:  Just go and make a list for me, please. [Person2]:  Fine, I'll go do that for you.
[Person1]:  Hi. Uh, haven't we met before? You look so familiar. [Person2]:  Yeah. We met on campus last week, [Yeah!] and you asked me the same question. [Person1]:  Oh, oh really? I'm really sorry, but I'm terrible with names. But, but, but... Let me guess. It's Sherry, right? [Person2]:  No, but you got the first letter right. [Person1]:  I know, I know. It's on the tip of my tongue. Wait. Uh, Sandy, Susan. [Nope. So, was I that memorable?] Wait, wait. It's Sharon. [Person2]:  You got it... and only on the fourth try. [Person1]:  So, well, Sh..., I mean Sharon. How are you? [Person2]:  Not bad. And what was your name? [Person1]:  It's Ben, but everyone calls me B.J. And, uh, what do you do, Sh... Sharon? [Person2]:  I'm a graduate student majoring in TESL. [Person1]:  Uh, TESL... What's that? [Person2]:  It stands for teaching English as a second language. I want to teach English to non-native speakers overseas. [Person1]:  Oh, yeah. I'm pretty good at that English grammar. You know, verbs and adjectives, and uh... Hey, that's sound really exciting. And do you need some type of specific degree or experience to do that? I mean could I do something like that? [Person2]:  Well, most employers overseas are looking for someone who has at least a Bachelor's degree and one or two years of experience. [Oh!] And what do you do? Are you a student on campus? [Person1]:  Yeah, but, uh... I guess I'm mulling over the idea of going into accounting or international business, but I guess I'm leaning now towards a degree in marketing. [Person2]:  Oh, uh,... Well, I have to run. I have a class in ten minutes. [Person1]:  Oh, okay. And, uh, by the way, there's this, uh, dance on campus at the student center tonight, and I was wondering if you'd... you know... like to come along. [Person2]:  Oh really? Well, perhaps... [Person1]:  Okay, well, bye.
[Person1]:  Hello. [Person2]:  Good morning. Can I help you? [Person1]:  Oh, good, you speak English. [Person2]:  Yes. [Person1]:  I'm looking for a double room for the next three nights... with a bathroom. [Person2]:  That's until Thursday? [Person1]:  Yes, have you got one? [Person2]:  Mm. We've got a double room for tonight and tomorrow night, but not for Thursday night. [Person1]:  Oh, dear. Nothing for Thursday night? [Person2]:  I'm afraid not. [Person1]:  Mm. And what about the price? [Person2]:  150 francs a night. That's for a double room without a bathroom. We're very full. We haven't got any more rooms with private bathrooms. [Person1]:  Oh... no bathroom... Well, thanks anyway.
[Person1]:  Your exam is over, isn't it? Why aren't you cheerful? [Person2]:  Oh, I don't know. It isn't that the questions were too hard, but I always feel uneasy when the exam doesn't seem to have much to do with the book.
[Person1]:  Whoa! This is a massive flea market!  [Person2]:  You're telling me! There are thousands of people here.  [Person1]:  And hundreds of booths-all filled with different kinds of stuff.  [Person2]:  This is almost like a Taiwanese night market! I can't believe it!  [Person1]:  You can't buy much more, Wei! You already have enough to fill two boxes to send back to Taiwan.  [Person2]:  Oh, yeah. OK. I'll just buy smallthings! 
[Person1]:  Excuse me can I ask you a few questions? I'm not going to take up too much of your time. [Person2]:  OK. [Person1]:  Well, how old are you? [Person2]:  16. [Person1]:  Right. When you leave school do you think you'll get your own home away from your parents? [Person2]:  Oh yes, I'm sure I will. [Person1]:  Do you think you'll get married in the next 5 years say? [Person2]:  Probably but I certainly don't want children yet. I'm too young. [Person1]:  OK, would you like to travel? [Person2]:  I'd like to. But I don't think I will although I have a lot of time. Anyway, you certainly need money for that. [Person1]:  Thanks very much.
[Person1]:  Mary, how's your job going? [Person2]:  I've moved to a new office and it's a little far from where I live. Actually, I'm looking for a new job because the people there are very unfriendly. [Person1]:  Oh, me too. I hate my job for I have to work overtime nearly every day. [Person2]:  What kind of job are you looking for? [Person1]:  I don't want to stay in the office anymore. Maybe I can work in the travel agency. How about you? [Person2]:  I checked on the internet and I think an office job in a hotel near my home seems nice.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, do you know where the nearest subway station is? [Person2]:  The nearest one is 10 minutes away on foot and it's the entrance to both line 5 and line 6, which one are you taking? [Person1]:  I'm not so sure. I'm here on vacation. [Person2]:  OK, where do you need to go then? [Person1]:  I want to go to the M hotel. [Person2]:  Oh, it's a long line 6, but it's 10 [Person1]:  OK. Do you know where it would be easier to get a taxi around here? [Person2]:  It's really difficult to get a taxi around this area on a weekend night. [Person1]:  Oh, no. What should I do? [Person2]:  Wait, you can still take line 5. It runs until midnight on weekends. [Person1]:  Does it have a stop near my hotel? [Person2]:  No, but from Line 5 you can transfer onto line 1 which has a stop near the hotel and it runs until 11 [Person1]:  That's great. Thank you.
[Person1]:  Hi, I would like to return this TV. [Person2]:  Sure, do you have the receipt? [Person1]:  Yeah here you go. Actually I also want to return this keyboard. [Person2]:  Ok. may I ask what is the reason for returning these products? [Person1]:  The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear. [Person2]:  I see, and what about the keyboard? [Person1]:  I spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work. [Person2]:  I am sorry mam, but we can only exchange or refund defective products, we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages. [Person1]:  Fine! I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways.
[Person1]:  What game do you like? [Person2]:  I like board games. I like chinese chess and draughts. [Person1]:  I ' Ve never played Chinese chess before, but I ' Ve seen old men playing it in the street. It looks complicated. [Person2]:  It ' s about as complicated as chess. The basic rule and moves are simple enough, but there are many strategies that players need to learn. [Person1]:  I like playing cards. I ' m pretty good at poker. Do you play cards? [Person2]:  I ' m terrible at cards and so I never play games which involve gambling, like poker. If I did, I ' d lose all my money. [Person1]:  Do you play bridge? [Person2]:  Yes, I do. It ' s hard to find four players though, so I don ' t play very often. Do you know anyone who plays? If so, we could set up a game. [Person1]:  I can play quite well. I have a friend who likes playing, but she ' s not very good at it. Shall I invite her to play? [Person2]:  Sure, I have a friend who play fairly well. We should find out when our friends are free and arrange a game. [Person1]:  I ' ll call my friend now. you call yours.
[Person1]:  As we know, mobile phones bring people great convenience and shorten the distance among friends and relatives. [Person2]:  It bears a great many of advantages, but also some weak points. [Person1]:  Is it? I've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone. [Person2]:  For instance, the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study. [Person1]:  That's true. Some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones. [Person2]:  Actually, it's not the fault of the mobile phone. But people should have a proper attitude towards it. Mobile phone is a tool serving people, not the fetters restricting them.
[Person1]:  Are you going out again? [Person2]:  Yes, I'm going to the cinema, dad. [Person1]:  You mustn't go to bed very late. Can you be home before nine. [Person2]:  Oh, I won't be back so early. The film will be over at nine. Can I have the key to the bicycle? [Person1]:  No. I won't let you ride a bicycle late at night. [Person2]:  Oh, dad, I'm not a child. I'm 17 already. I'll come back as soon as the film is over. [Person1]:  OK. Here's the key. Take care. [Person2]:  I will. Thank you, dad.
[Person1]:  How was your holiday to Cyprus? [Person2]:  It was so fantastic I didn't really want to come home. [Person1]:  Did you happen to meet someone? [Person2]:  How did you know? [Person1]:  You always act like this when you'Ve fallen in love. Who is he? How did you meet? [Person2]:  His name is Tony and we met my first night in Pathos. He works with my sister who lives there. [Person1]:  Was it love at first sight? [Person2]:  Not really. I wasn't looking for a holiday romance, but my sister told me that she had promised him that she'd set him up on blind date with me. I didn't think I'd have anything to lose, so I went. [Person1]:  And? [Person2]:  Let's just say that by the third date, we both realized that we had fallen in love. [Person1]:  That happened quickly! Are you going to see him again? [Person2]:  Luckily, his company has a position available here, so he's going to see if he can get relocated. [Person1]:  It sounds like he is madly in love with you. Are you ready for such a serious relationship? [Person2]:  Well, I'm not really a spring chicken anymore. We don't know what will happen.
[Person1]:  Good evening. What'll you have? [Person2]:  I'd like a beer. What kind of beer do you have? [Person1]:  Draft beer and cans beer. Which do you prefer? [Person2]:  A draft beer please. [Person1]:  OK. Here you are. [Person2]:  Could I have some fruit? [Person1]:  Of course. Wait for a moment, please.
[Person1]:  Welcome to Super Stereos. What can I do for you? [Person2]:  I'd like to look at your stereo systems. Do you have anything on sale? [Person1]:  Yes, this system over here is on sale for $ 1, 000. As you can see, all of the components are brand-name. [Person2]:  But it doesn't have a turntable. I have a fair number of vinyl records, so I need something to play them on. [Person1]:  Our selection of stereo systems with turntables is somewhat limited, but we do have this system over here.

[Person1]:  Welcome to Lens Magic, ma'am. How can I help you? [Person2]:  I'd like to buy an inexpensive camera. [Person1]:  Well, we'Ve got several point-and-shoot cameras. These are all 35mm compact cameras with auto-focus and a built-in flash. We also have these Polaroid cameras. [Person2]:  I don't think I'll need a Polaroid. Does this 35mm camera have an automatic flash? [Person1]:  Yes, it does. But you can turn it off if you want. [Person2]:  Okay, I'll take this one. Does it come with batteries and a case? [Person1]:  Yes, it does. Here, I'll box it up for you.
[Person1]:  Would you like me to show you our new cleaning unit? It's a clever design. [Person2]:  Yes, I'd like to see that. What does it clean exactly? [Person1]:  It washes the solvent off all the metal parts - the blades, trays etc. - and then sends it back into the system. [Person2]:  What does the unit consist of? [Person1]:  Well, it's basically two tanks, one for the dirty solvent and one for the clean solvent, a pump and a washing unit. Oh, and there's a cooling system and a filter. It's all controlled by a PLC system, that stands for Process Logic Control.
[Person1]:  Can I have a look at your international timetable? [Person2]:  Sorry. We don't have a printed one. Is there anything else I can do for you? [Person1]:  Yes. Do you have any direct flight to Tokyo? [Person2]:  Sorry, we don't. I don't think you can find any airline which offers a non-stop flight to Tokyo. [Person1]:  What about a flight to Paris? [Person2]:  Yes. It is really a place of interest and we have the direct flight everyday.
[Person1]:  How often do you service the pump? [Person2]:  We take very good care of this particular pump. It's a crucial part of our process. We clean it and flush it through at the end of every shift, We check the high pressure seals, recalibrate the gauges and lubricate all moving parts weekly. We replace the gaskets every month. [Person1]:  How do you decide how often these things need to be done? [Person2]:  Well, from experience we can predict the lifespan of different components. We try to replace components before they fail or wear out. This prevents the equipment from breaking down. It also saves us a lot of trouble!
[Person1]:  May I speak to Mr. Li? [Person2]:  Which Li, ma'am? There are two Lis here. [Person1]:  Oh? Mr. Li, head of the Export Section. [Person2]:  Oh, the chief? That's Mr. Michael Li, then. [Person1]:  Is that right? [Person2]:  I'm sorry, but Mr. Li's gone on a trip. [Person1]:  I see. When will he return? [Person2]:  He'll be back next Monday. [Person1]:  All right. I'll call on Monday again. [Person2]:  May I have your name? [Person1]:  Mrs. Dorothy Preston. [Person2]:  Mrs. Dorothy Preston. Is that Dorothy with a 'y'? [Person1]:  That's right. [Person2]:  I'll tell Mr. Li you called when he returns. [Person1]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  Would you like to order now?  [Person2]:  Yes, can you recommend some steak?  [Person1]:  Sure. I think pepper steak is quite good. Many guests like it very much.  [Person2]:  OK I will try it. Do you have a small portion? I am afraid I can't finish the large one.  [Person1]:  Yes madam. I will give you the small one. 
[Person1]:  Good morning. Is this where I can get a library card issued to me?  [Person2]:  No problem, we have a short form right here; just hand it to me when you are done.  [Person1]:  I'm done.  [Person2]:  That looks great, but I will also need your driver's license or other form of I. D.  [Person1]:  Sure, here it is.  [Person2]:  Well, this looks nice. Do you know how to use it?  [Person1]:  I am pretty sure how to use it, but can you remind me?  [Person2]:  Of course, just remember that all of the needed information is on the card.  [Person1]:  I see.  [Person2]:  Well, I hope you have a wonderful time on your library visits! 
[Person1]:  You're a wonderful person, Kathleen.  [Person2]:  So you are.  [Person1]:  And I'm so honored that you would want to be with me because you would never be with anyone who wasn't truly worthy.  [Person2]:  I feel exactly the same way with you.  [Person1]:  Don't, don't, don't, don't say that. That, that makes it worse.  [Person2]:  What? You don't love me? Me, either.  [Person1]:  You don't love me?  [Person2]:  No.  [Person1]:  But we're so right for each other.  [Person2]:  I know, I know. Well, is there some, is there someone else? Oh, that woman on television, Sydney Ann. 
[Person1]:  Hi, Janice. Our first weekend after being employed is coming. Show me your plan. [Person2]:  My mom phoned me this morning, and asked me to go back home to have housework chores. [Person1]:  What are you assigned to do? [Person2]:  God knows. Speaking of chores, I would rather do some washing than cooking. [Person1]:  For me, I think I will iron my shirt and trousers. Actually, weekends tend to be the most hectic day in the whole week. [Person2]:  I really hope that I could sleep like a log all through two nights. But. . . Some one said that weekends are a bit like rainbows ; they look good from a distance but disappear before we get up close to them. [Person1]:  I couldn't agree more.
[Person1]:  I really need to go shopping.  [Person2]:  What do you need to buy?  [Person1]:  I need to look for a new bedroom set.  [Person2]:  Where are you going to go look for one?  [Person1]:  I have absolutely no idea.  [Person2]:  You don't know where you want to look for one?  [Person1]:  No, I'm not sure where they sell nice bedroom sets.  [Person2]:  Do you want to know where I got mine from?  [Person1]:  Yes, because I love yours.  [Person2]:  I purchased mine from IKEA.  [Person1]:  Is IKEA affordable?  [Person2]:  Not at all, but you get what you pay for. 
[Person1]:  What happened to you yesterday?  [Person2]:  Oh I fell over on the way to work.  [Person1]:  Oh I see. So that's why you didn't come in?  [Person2]:  Yes and I broke my phone too so I couldn't call you.  [Person1]:  Oh dear, that sounds terrible.  [Person2]:  It was! But the worst thing was I tore my best shirt.  [Person1]:  Oh dear. Well, get well soon and try to be more careful in future. 
[Person1]:  Well, Jenny, the school year is almost over. We just have 2 more weeks before exams. What do you plan to do this summer? [Person2]:  I'm going to teach English to some immigrants in the universities community service program. [Person1]:  That sounds interesting, don't you need to speak a foreign language for a job like that? [Person2]:  No, I don't. I just have to present the language simply and give the students a chance to practice speaking. [Person1]:  Come to think of it. That's the way I was taught to speak Chinese, but speaking Chinese didn't help me learn to read and write Chinese. [Person2]:  My students won't want to read and write English, at least not now. They are more interested in speaking. [Person1]:  You sound very knowledgeable about all of this. How do you know so much? [Person2]:  I took a teaching English as a second language course last year when you were in China. I've also talked with the program administrators quite a lot. I think I would like to be an ESL teacher when I graduate.
[Person1]:  Hey, Jim. It's time to wake up and get out of bed. [Person2]:  Do I have to get up now? [Person1]:  You'd better get up, or you'll be late. [Person2]:  What're you talking about? My alarm even hasn't gone off yet. [Person1]:  Yes, it did. It went off thirty minutes ago. You slept right through it. You're like a dead person while you sleep. [Person2]:  I must have slept right through it. [Person1]:  Rise and shine! Sleepyhead! [Person2]:  Just let me sleep five more minutes. [Person1]:  The early bird gets the worm. [Person2]:  I know, I know. But I don't want any worms. [Person1]:  Ha! Ha! If you don't make an effort now, later on it'll be a lot tougher for you.
[Person1]:  How's your new car? [Person2]:  Perfect! Couldn't be better. [Person1]:  You made a good choice, then? [Person2]:  It's just what I want. [Person1]:  No regrets? [Person2]:  I am really pleased with it. [Person1]:  I am glad you are happy. [Person2]:  It's super.
[Person1]:  I am sorry to trouble you again, Mr. Stone. [Person2]:  It's ok. What do you want to ask? [Person1]:  Where should I go after I arrived at the university? [Person2]:  The first place you should go is the International Center. [Person1]:  Why? [Person2]:  You can get help there in dealing with the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service ; you can find Foreign Student Advisers. [Person1]:  What kind of role do foreign student advisers play? [Person2]:  They'll discuss personal concerns, housing, adjustment, finances and other matters with you. [Person1]:  Can we get any more help at the International Center? [Person2]:  Yes, a lot more. If you go there just before the beginning of the fall's semester, you can get your student ID and social security number there. They will keep your documents up-to-date. They will offer an orientation program for new comers. They will also help you contact your department and registration office. [Person1]:  I see. It must be worth going to. [Person2]:  Besides these, the center staff also works with community organizations which provide tours, home hospitality, speaking engagements and assistance for wives of foreign students. In cooperation with nationality clubs, student associations and other organizations, the International Center provides a varied program of cultural and social events throughout the year. [Person1]:  Wonderful. It is a home for foreign students. [Person2]:  It sure is. They also serve tea, coffee and refreshments. The Center staff members are also friendly and helpful. Everyone loves them.
[Person1]:  Wow, Amy, look at that number. [Person2]:  What's so great about it? [Person1]:  What do you mean? It's a scrim. [Person2]:  Not to me, I wouldn't be caught dead in that. [Person1]:  I love that kind of stuff. [Person2]:  Yeah, you seem to like those styles. [Person1]:  Sure do. I get a kick out of looking punk. [Person2]:  This one looks really expensive though. [Person1]:  I don't care how much it costs. I'm rolling in it. [Person2]:  Lucky you! I can't buy anything else. I'm flat broke. [Person1]:  I got a replace my party outfit, I trashed it last week. [Person2]:  Why did you drag me into this? I've spent a week salary. [Person1]:  Are you on the level? You're the one who called me, remember? [Person2]:  Just joking, T. I've got some wonderful clothes. Let's go and have a close look at your outfit.
[Person1]:  Do you have any questions before you commit yourself to this? [Person2]:  Actually, yes I do. I was wondering about the subscription fee. And how much will you charge me during the time of redeeming this new fund? [Person1]:  The subscription fee is charged at a rate of 1. 2 %. But for redeeming, a rate of a usual 0. 5 %, we shall charge you 1. 6 % if you apply to buy it after the fund-raising period. [Person2]:  So, it's going to cost me then? [Person1]:  I'm afraid so, yes. There is always some risk on the buyer's part.
[Person1]:  The art critic from the daily chronicle doesn't think much of the max oreo exhibition. He says that the artwork is uninspiring and old fashioned. [Person2]:  Really? I thought the exhibition showed that he had real talent. What did you think of it? [Person1]:  I liked it. I didn't think his works were masterpieces, but the certainly weren't uninspiring, in my opinion. [Person2]:  I don't think I'Ve ever read a good review of an exhibition by that critic. He doesn't seem to like anything. Which kinds of paintings do you prefer? [Person1]:  I like landscapes and still life. You prefer abstract paintings, don't you? [Person2]:  Yes, I do. I like painters who use will rather than watercolors. The colors appear richer. What do you think? [Person1]:  I agree. I prefer oils too. I collect landscapes, but I only have a small collection. You have a small collection of abstract art, don't you? [Person2]:  Yes. Good artwork is very expensive nowadays. When I was in china, I bought some calligraphy by famous artists. You should come and see it sometime. [Person1]:  That would be nice. Can you read the characters? [Person2]:  I know what the characters on the paintings mean. I think Chinese characters look very artistic. It's said that the way they are written can give insight into the artist's character. [Person1]:  I think that's true with any of the fine arts.
[Person1]:  Do you mind if I ask you a question? [Person2]:  No, not at all. Go ahead. [Person1]:  What do you do in order to improve your English? [Person2]:  I go to movies ; I go to lectures ; I listen to the radio ; I do lots of things. Most importantly, I practice every chance I get. [Person1]:  It's a good idea to have a radio, isn't it? [Person2]:  Sure. It's like understanding on the telephone,, you can't see the speaker! It's great for improving listening comprehension. [Person1]:  It takes a long time to learn a language, doesn't it? [Person2]:  It certainly does. But if you practice speaking every spare minute and learn useful sentences every day you can make big progress.
[Person1]:  What kind of jobs are becoming popular in your country? [Person2]:  As in many countries, there's been a big growth in anything related to computers. Young people are attracted to that field in particular. There's also been a big growth in education. [Person1]:  There's been a growth in that field in my country too. A lot of people want to learn practical and professional skills. [Person2]:  The interesting thing is that many of the teachers are not actually trained teachers. They are usually professionals who are taking a break from their jobs to pass on skills to others. [Person1]:  I noticed that too. What are the people learning? [Person2]:  In my country, they are usually studying something business-related, such as marketing, management techniques, and human resource management. [Person1]:  I think that jobs in the leisure industry will become more popular in the future. [Person2]:  That trend has already begun in my country. In particular, there's a big demand for people to work in fitness centers. Which kinds of jobs are less in demand? [Person1]:  Those in traditional fields, such as agriculture and heavy industry. Younger people are not interested in doing those jobs and other countries have industries that can produce things much cheaper. [Person2]:  Yes. My country is certainly expanding in the service and hi-tech sectors, but contracting in the heavy industry and primary industry sectors. However, our car and aircraft manufacturers are doing very well. [Person1]:  They are well known for high quality, that's why.
[Person1]:  I really appreciate your driving me around. [Person2]:  It's no problem. I have time today, and I think it's important that you find a good place. [Person1]:  It would be hard for just me to do it. I don't know the city at all. [Person2]:  So what do you see in there? [Person1]:  This one sounds good. Efficiency with view of the lake. Utilities and parking included. Newly remodeled kitchen. $ 470. [Person2]:  Can you afford that much? [Person1]:  No, I guess not. But that's what I want, isn't it? An efficiency. [Person2]:  Yes, an efficiency is a small apartment. Usually one large room and a small bathroom. There is often a small kitchen too. So it's good for one person. [Person1]:  How about this one? Downtown efficiency. Furnished. . . What does furnished mean? [Person2]:  That means the apartment has furniture in it. [Person1]:  That's good. [Person2]:  Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad. You have to like the furniture. [Person1]:  Furnished. Parking included. $ 400. [Person2]:  It's still pretty expensive. [Person1]:  Yes, but it's downtown. I would like to take look at this one. [Person2]:  Alright. What's the phone number? [Person1]:  256-7797. [Person2]:  Got it. What else do you see? [Person1]:  This one. Two male grad students seeking roommate. Must be quiet. Comfortable downtown apartment. Does this mean I have to share a room with them? [Person2]:  No. It probably means they have a large apartment. Probably a living room, kitchen and three bedrooms. They need someone for the empty bedroom. [Person1]:  That sounds alright. [Person2]:  Yes, it might be an advantage for you. You are a foreigner, after all. If they're alright roommates, you could learn a lot from them. [Person1]:  Here's the number, 256-4367. [Person2]:  Got it. Let's call these two and see if we can make appointments to see the apartments. [Person1]:  Sounds good to me. I really appreciate your help on this. [Person2]:  Don't mention it, Larry. What are friends for anyway?
[Person1]:  Shall we have some soup first? [Person2]:  No, thank you. I don't like soup. I'd rather have some fruit juice to start with. [Person1]:  Ok, and what about the main course? Which would you rather have, fish or meat? [Person2]:  Meat, I think. [Person1]:  Don't you like fish then? [Person2]:  I do, but I want meat. [Person1]:  Shall we have some white wine then? [Person2]:  Yes, but I prefer red wine with meat. [Person1]:  What would you like for dessert? [Person2]:  I just want to have a coffee, I think. [Person1]:  Fine, and after dinner, shall we go to a disco? [Person2]:  No, thanks. I'd like to go straight home. I'm very tired.
[Person1]:  Ok, so where do you think we can save more money? [Person2]:  Well, we could eat in more. That 300 dollars for entertainment is mostly going to restaurants. [Person1]:  Yeah. That's a good idea and you like to cook. What about the books? [Person2]:  No, I need my books. [Person1]:  Come on. If we save more money, we can retire earlier and you'll actually have time to read all those books you buy. [Person2]:  Well, what about the 50 you spent on a shirt? You could have gotten something for less. [Person1]:  Ok. Let's compromise. If you agree to only spend 75 on books, I'll agree to only spend 40 for my next shirt. [Person2]:  All right. That sounds fair.
[Person1]:  Do you know who's just got married? Old Mc Donald. [Person2]:  Never! He's over 80, isn't he? [Person1]:  He's nearly 90. [Person2]:  Good gracious! Are you sure? [Person1]:  I am. Whatsmore, his wife is 84. [Person2]:  Is she really? [Person1]:  Yes, she is. And guess what, he is her sixth husband. [Person2]:  Really? Quite a woman, isn't she?
[Person1]:  Let me see now. Which train do I need to get on? [Person2]:  Excuse me. Do you need any help? [Person1]:  Yes, I want to go to Tokyo Tower, but I'm really lost. This is my first visit to Japan, so I have no idea on how to ride the trains. [Person2]:  First, you need to buy a ticket to your destination. [Um-HUH] From here, it's a hundred and thirty yen. [Person1]:  A hundred thirty yen. Okay. [Person2]:  Then, get on the Hibiya Subway Line at platform number 4. [Person1]:  Number 4, alright. Oh, and how often do the trains come around this time of day? [Person2]:  Usually, they come about every six minutes or so. [Person1]:  Alright. And where do I get off the train. [Person2]:  Get off at Kamiyacho Station, three stops from here. The sign at the station is written in English, so you'll be able to read it. [Person1]:  Three stops. Got it. Thanks for your help. [Person2]:  No problem. Good luck.
[Person1]:  I hear John left his cat in your care while he's on vacation abroad. How are you getting along with it? [Person2]:  Well, it never comes when I call it. It spills its food and sheds all over the place. I can't wait till John gets back.
[Person1]:  Hello. Is that Mr. Nelson? This is Linda speaking. [Person2]:  Hello, Miss Linda. What can I do for you? [Person1]:  I'm on my way to visit you now, but I've lost my way. [Person2]:  That's too bad. Where are you now, Miss Linda? [Person1]:  I don't know exactly. I think I'm somewhere on New Hampshire Street. I'm calling you from a bookstore. [Person2]:  A bookstore on New Hampshire Street. It's at a corner, isn't it? [Person1]:  Yes, it is. And I can see a restaurant at the other corner. [Person2]:  Now I'm almost sure where you are. You turned at the second corner. You should have turned at the first corner from the railway station. [Person1]:  Is that so? Then I'll go back to the first corner. [Person2]:  It'll be better that way. You'll find a one-way traffic sign. That's where you have to turn to the left. Come up the slope to reach a six-storied apartment house. My room is on the third floor. [Person1]:  I'm sure I won't have any trouble this time. Thanks. [Person2]:  I'll be waiting for you. Bye.
[Person1]:  . . . I knew it. I always knew you were a lesbian!  [Person2]:  She's my roommate, not my date. [to Yi-jun] The D-man, as in dork.  [Person1]:  Haha. Still got that great sense of humor, I see. Here's my card. I sell used cars. A car from us is a car you can trust!  [Person2]:  Alrighty then. Didn't you use to date Sheryl?  [Person1]:  Sweet little lassie. Yep, broke her heart when the D-man told her he couldn't be a one-woman guy.  [Person2]:  Oh? I heard she dumped you. Anyway, she's right over there. Oh, Sheryl! 
[Person1]:  Anyone home? Jen!  [Person2]:  I'm in the kitchen. . . let yourself in!  [Person1]:  Wow! You're really working up a storm!  [Person2]:  I know. I've even worked up a sweat.  [Person1]:  You look like a cooking show host--only messier. 
[Person1]:  Tired again, Samantha. [Person2]:  Oh, sorry, James. I've had such a busy week and this morning was just. Uh...I woke up really early at 5 [Person1]:  What? At 5 [Person2]:  Yes, then I had a shower and went out to catch a bus into town. Instead of 8 o'clock AM, it didn't come until 8 [Person1]:  Oh, dear. What happened next? [Person2]:  When I got to town, it was 9 [Person1]:  Why did you go to the library? [Person2]:  I needed some information for my school project, but I spent 2 hours looking for something about the Kings and Queens of England. But all the books I needed were out of the library. [Person1]:  Why didn't you go to the book shop in Stanley Street? [Person2]:  I've didn't have enough money on me, so I caught the bus home at 12 [Person1]:  What time did you get home? [Person2]:  Not until 2 [Person1]:  Oh, dear.
[Person1]:  Professor Edward, could I have a talk with you about the oral presentation? [Person2]:  OK. Was there something about the requirements you didn't understand? [Person1]:  No. I just don't think I can do it. [Person2]:  You don't think you'll be ready in time? [Person1]:  I'm not here to ask for more time. In fact, it's because I'll get very nervous in front of people. It's a problem I've had since I was a child. [Person2]:  I see. There has to be some way we can deal with it. [Person1]:  I could write a paper instead. Some of my teachers in high school let me do that. [Person2]:  But if I let you do that, I'd be opening myself up to the blame of unfair treatment. Well, would you be nervous if you gave the presentation in front of a video camera? [Person1]:  You mean recorded with a camera and then show it to the class? It might work. Actually, that's a great idea. I could do it over and over again until I got it perfect. But the other students, won't they... [Person2]:  Well, I'll have some explaining to do. I think they'll understand.
[Person1]:  Hey Joe, what are you doing in this department store? [Person2]:  Hi, Rita, I'm just looking for a pair of shoes. I won't be here for long. [Person1]:  Why not? When I go shoe shopping, I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices. [Person2]:  That's my problem. I don't have a lot of options. [Person1]:  What do you mean? This is a big store, isn't it? [Person2]:  Yes, but I have unusually big feet. That wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide, and only a few brands sell shoes that I can fit into. [Person1]:  So how do you usually go about buying shoes, then? [Person2]:  Well, first of all, I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection. [Person1]:  Well, you're in the right store. If they don't have it, no one will. [Person2]:  After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me. I prefer white, so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size. Since I ' m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications, it makes it a very easy choice.
[Person1]:  Have you adapted to the lifestyle in China? [Person2]:  Yeah, almost. But there is one thing. [Person1]:  What? [Person2]:  I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people. I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China, but... [Person1]:  What is it? [Person2]:  Some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others. [Person1]:  That makes you feel uncomfortable? [Person2]:  Yeah. we never do that in a public office. [Person1]:  Perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy. [Person2]:  I have felt that. One day when i was in a queue, reading a newspaper story, the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding. [Person1]:  Well, that's not rare. I've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus. [Person2]:  Just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him? [Person1]:  Yeah. [Person2]:  Oh, I'm shocked.
[Person1]:  How come you're still up? Shouldn't you be asleep by now? Is there anything wrong? [Person2]:  I've been having a hard time sleeping lately. [Person1]:  As far as I know, insomnia is usually caused by stress. Are you stressed at all? [Person2]:  Well. Actually, not. I think it's because I just had a appendicitis surgery and I am not feeling so good. [Person1]:  What? When did you have it? Why I don't know that at all! Are you okay now? If you are feeling no good, we should go to the hospital right now. [Person2]:  No, no, no. Mom. Please calm down. It's okay. It's a normal reaction after the surgery. [Person1]:  Really? Are you sure? [Person2]:  Yes, Please calm down. I am okay. But when I move, the wound hurts and it makes me hard to sleep. [Person1]:  Alright. Now, tell me what happened! [Person2]:  Oh, please. I'll tell you but please calm down first. Okay? [Person1]:  Sure. Go ahead. [Person2]:  Do you remember when I went to the university last week, I got a fever? [Person1]:  Yes, you caught a cold I remember. [Person2]:  Well it's not. It was actually appendicitis. And it caused my fever. [Person1]:  What? [Person2]:  Yes, and after I arrived at the university, it became more apparent. My stomach began to hurt. And it was really painful. I fainted. My classmates sent me to the hospital. And they operated a surgery on me. [Person1]:  Oh God. It was my fault. I should have found it earlier. [Person2]:  It's okay mom. Even I thought it was just a fever. I left the hospital after three days. I am almost perfectly okay now.
[Person1]:  I found out when Jim's birthday is. It's this Friday. [Person2]:  Let's plan a surprise party for him! [Person1]:  Can you spread the word and ask everyone to bring some kind of snack food? [Person2]:  That's easy. Anything else? [Person1]:  Will you call his wife and let her know so that if she is available, she can come too? [Person2]:  Won't he be surprised! [Person1]:  I don't know how old he is though. [Person2]:  That's O. K. Maybe his wife will spill the beans!
[Person1]:  How's it going? [Person2]:  I'm fine, thank you. [Person1]:  Did you need help with something? [Person2]:  If I could, I would like to view the apartment sometime today. [Person1]:  That won't be possible today. [Person2]:  Why is that? [Person1]:  You can only view the apartment with an appointment. [Person2]:  I would like to make one right now if I can. [Person1]:  Are you available this Friday? [Person2]:  Can we do it at 6 o'clock? [Person1]:  Your appointment for Friday at 6 pm has been confirmed. [Person2]:  All right. I'll see you on Friday.
[Person1]:  I'll be glad when winter comes. [Person2]:  Why is that? [Person1]:  Because I love the snow. [Person2]:  Yes, the snow is fun. [Person1]:  Last year we made a big snowman. [Person2]:  How big was it? [Person1]:  It was seven feet tall. [Person2]:  How long did it take? [Person1]:  It took us all day. [Person2]:  Did you give him a nose? [Person1]:  Of course. We gave him a big carrot for a nose. [Person2]:  Let me help you make one this year.
[Person1]:  Could I meet with you to discuss the project? [Person2]:  Good idea. We could meet on Monday or Tuesday. Which day would you prefer? [Person1]:  Tuesday would be good for me. [Person2]:  OK. Do you think we should meet in the morning or in the afternoon? [Person1]:  I think the afternoon would be best. [Person2]:  That will work out. I will e-mail the exact time tomorrow. I need you to bring your plans with you. [Person1]:  Yes, I will bring my plans with me to the meeting. [Person2]:  Should we invite the whole committee or should we just have the sub-committee there? [Person1]:  I feel that the whole committee needs to be there. [Person2]:  Yes, I agree. We'll make sure that they get notified. Can you find the meeting place? [Person1]:  Yes, I know how to get there on my own. [Person2]:  Great! We will send you all the details later. Looking forward to meeting with you!
[Person1]:  What do you do? [Person2]:  I'm a firefighter. [Person1]:  Really? That's so cool. [Person2]:  I'm really lucky to do something I really love. [Person1]:  What station do you work at? [Person2]:  I work downtown at station 24. It can get a little crazy sometimes but that's what makes it challenging.
[Person1]:  Hello, Jack. Congratulations. Your team won the game. [Person2]:  Thank you, Sally. You watched the game, didn't you? [Person1]:  Of coures. Your football team did so well. The third team goal, especially, was really good. [Person2]:  Yes, but it wasn't easy to win, the visiting team was really strong. [Person1]:  It was, but your team was even stronger. Your coach did a good job, and all of the players did a good job, too. [Person2]:  Thank you very much. [Person1]:  When is your next match? [Person2]:  On Friday, next week.
[Person1]:  Hi. I just lost my purse when I was shopping on the street. I guess somebody stole it from me. [Person2]:  Sorry to hear that. Could you tell me what were in your purse? [Person1]:  My mobile phone, passport and some cash. [Person2]:  When did you come to America? [Person1]:  Just a couple of days ago. [Person2]:  Could you recall when and where you lost it? [Person1]:  I have no idea. [Person2]:  OK. I have written it down. Who is your emergency contact person in America? [Person1]:  That is my friend Tim who lives nearby. [Person2]:  OK. We will contact you as soon as we have any clues.
[Person1]:  Am I late? [Person2]:  No, you've got an hour and a quarter. Your flight leaves at 9 [Person1]:  I'm so excited. [Person2]:  Have you got everything? [Person1]:  Yes, my tickets and my traveler's checks. [Person2]:  And your passport? [Person1]:  Yes, don't worry.
[Person1]:  Hi, I'm George. I'll be your waiter this evening. Are you ready to order or do you need a few more minutes?  [Person2]:  I'm ready now. I'd like the roast chicken and a side order of corn.  [Person1]:  And would you like an appetizer before your meal? The soup of the day is our delicious tomato soup.  [Person2]:  I'll pass on the soup, but I'd like a garden salad.  [Person1]:  Can I get you anything to drink?  [Person2]:  Yes, I'd like a glass of iced tea.  [Person1]:  Okay. I'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad.  [Person2]:  Thank you. 
[Person1]:  What's the first thing you do when you go to the bathroom in the morning?  [Person2]:  I look at myself in the mirror. Sometimes, it's not a pleasant sight, especially if I have been out late the late before.  [Person1]:  Do you usually shower or take a bath?  [Person2]:  I usually don't have time for a bath in the mornings, so I just take a shower. Sometimes I need a cold shower to wake me up and sometimes I need a hot one, especially if it's winter and I need to warm up.  [Person1]:  Do you shave every morning?  [Person2]:  I shave every workday, but I only shave at weekends if I'm going out somewhere. If I'm staying at home, I don't shave.  [Person1]:  Do you brush your teeth twice a day as dentists recommend?  [Person2]:  Yes. I brush my teeth in the morning, just before I go to work. It's actually the last thing I do before leaving. Then I brush again before bed.  [Person1]:  Your dentist must be proud of you! 
[Person1]:  Susan, good evening. Why are you so dressed up?  [Person2]:  I'm on my way out to a New Year's banquet. How do I look? Is my make-up ok?  [Person1]:  You look great. Your make-up is perfect.  [Person2]:  Do your think I should wear a different dress?  [Person1]:  No, the one you have on looks fabulous, especially with your hair like that.  [Person2]:  Thanks for saying. Do you have any ideas which neckleace I should wear?  [Person1]:  With that dress I'd like to say your white diamond necklace would look perfect.  [Person2]:  Thanks for helping out. Now Im ready, what are you doing tonight?  [Person1]:  Not much, Just a house party with some friends.  [Person2]:  Sounds fun. Anyone I know?  [Person1]:  Yeah, most of the people are from my office.  [Person2]:  Sounds like I'm missing out on a good time. Oh, well, there's always next year.  [Person1]:  I'm sure you will have fun no matter where you go. Remember to take your bag. 
[Person1]:  Sometimes I wish I could live on a deserted island. [Person2]:  Why do you feel that way? I don't think I could stand being away from people for so long. [Person1]:  Who said it had to be long? I'd like to live there for just half a year or so. It'll be fun to try it out. I read about a young guy who ran his own Internet business. He could do all his work online. So it didn't really matter where he lived. One day, he decided that he was sick of being around people and doing all the regular things that he did. He wanted a break, but not just a little vacation. So he found a beautiful small island, where he could live quietly without anyone around him. He caught his own fish, filled containers with rainwater and connected to the Internet through satellite. He did this for 6 months and then came back into society. [Person2]:  It must have been a wild experience. I'm impressed. [Person1]:  Yeah, me too. He's my hero.
[Person1]:  Can you show me how to use this phone? [Person2]:  Yes, I can help you with that. Pick up the receiver and hit one of the buttons. Do you hear a tone? [Person1]:  No, I don't hear anything. [Person2]:  Next you dial 9 on the keypad. You should hear the tone change. Did you hear it change? [Person1]:  I'm not sure. [Person2]:  OK. Well, after you get the line to change you have an outside line. Who are you trying to call? [Person1]:  I am trying to call a client. [Person2]:  To call a number on the outside you now just dial the number. For inside calls, punch in the extension number. Has someone given you an extension list? [Person1]:  No, I don't know anyone's extension. [Person2]:  All of the extensions are listed on the wall chart over there if you ever need help.
[Person1]:  Hey, John. Rise and shine. [Person2]:  What time is it, Sheila? How long have I been here? [Person1]:  Hmm... about 2 hours. I think the library is a quiet place for a sleeping. [Person2]:  You've got a point. I always mean to study hard, but I nod off soon. Maybe it's too quiet here. [Person1]:  You were thinking Edwards Carlson's psychology classes, right? [Person2]:  Yeah, he's a nice teacher. But he just can't seem to come down to earth. He seemed to be talking to himself the whole class. It made everyone sleepy. [Person1]:  You should have been in my history classes with Professor Rivers. He always encourages his students to collect information after class. Some of his students are wonderful. Once a student got up and challenged him to name 6 women who made great contributions to the American Revolution. It really beat him. He just listed 3. [Person2]:  It was really embarrassing for the teacher. [Person1]:  Especially when the student started telling him over a dozen names. But at last, the teacher praised her. [Person2]:  After all, I doubt whether many students can name even one. It's really a different question. [Person1]:  That's true. I sure I can't.
[Person1]:  What are your personal weaknesses? [Person2]:  I ' m afraid I ' m a poor talker. I ' m not comfortable talking with the people whom I have just met for the first time. That is not very good for business, so I have been studying public speaking. [Person1]:  Are you more of a leader or a follower? [Person2]:  I don ' t try to lead people. I ' d rather cooperate with everybody, and get the job done by working together. [Person1]:  Do you think you can make yourself easily understood in English? [Person2]:  Yes, in most circumstances. [Person1]:  Are you available for travel? [Person2]:  Yes, I like travelling. I am young, and unmarried. It ' s no problem for me to travel frequently.
[Person1]:  Good afternoon, Peace Hotel, what can I do for you? [Person2]:  I have made a reservation for this Sunday. My name is Bobby [Person1]:  Yes, that's right. Your room is a single one with a bath. [Person2]:  I am calling to cancel it now. I can't go to your city this week. [Person1]:  Fine, we will cancel it. [Person2]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  Could I ask some questions regarding to the social benefits? [Person2]:  Go ahead, please. [Person1]:  How long is my paid vacation every year? [Person2]:  You'll have 10 days paid vacation every year. [Person1]:  What about the insurance and housing policies? [Person2]:  We will provide you with life insurance, health insurance, accident insurance, housing benefits, heating allowance and transportation allowance. [Person1]:  How often is the bonus? [Person2]:  You'll be paid a bonus at the end of every year. [Person1]:  Do I have training opportunities? [Person2]:  We provide our employees with training opportunities at home and abroad. [Person1]:  Well, I don't have any other questions so far. I would like to think for a couple of days before I give you my final answer. [Person2]:  Sure. I will ask Lucy to call you in two days. [Person1]:  Ok, thank you for your time and patience. [Person2]:  You're welcome.
[Person1]:  This historian is famous in the field of Tang Dynasty. [Person2]:  So he always sits above the salt when there is a seminar about it. [Person1]:  Right, to be famous to be respectable in some way. [Person2]:  You got it.
[Person1]:  how's it going? [Person2]:  I'm in a good mood today, actually. How about you? [Person1]:  to be honest, I'm a bit fed up. [Person2]:  what's wrong? [Person1]:  there's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around. [Person2]:  I see! Do you want to ask her out? [Person1]:  sure, but how? [Person2]:  you can ask her out for drink after work. [Person1]:  but for what reasons? She doesn't even know who I am. [Person2]:  then you've got a lot of homework to do. You need to get her notice first. [Person1]:  easier said than done. [Person2]:  you can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying hello to her. [Person1]:  but I always get tongue-tied when I see her. [Person2]:  that's something you need to overcome. Men should make the first move as most of girls prefer being chased. [Person1]:  I see. I'll try. [Person2]:  good luck!
[Person1]:  Are you being served, Sir? [Person2]:  No, not yet. I just want to hair cut. [Person1]:  Would you sit here, please? How would you like it cut? [Person2]:  I want it short. [Person1]:  What, your short already, sir. [Person2]:  I mean very short. shorter than it's now. [Person1]:  Should I just trim it? [Person2]:  No. you can cut quite a bit off, I like it to be very short all over. You see what I mean. [Person1]:  Oh, I see. You like Chinese style, don't you? [Person2]:  Yes. And Chinese style. [Person1]:  Would you like to have some shampoo, sir? [Person2]:  No, thank you. [Person1]:  How about oil or spray? [Person2]:  No, Nothing will be kind. [Person1]:  There, how's that? [Person2]:  That's very good.
[Person1]:  Will you sit down, Mr. White? [Person2]:  Thank you. It's very kind of you to invite me to such a beautiful place. [Person1]:  I propose a toast to your pleasant tour in China. [Person2]:  Thank you very much. [Person1]:  This food is a Wax specialty. Please help yourself. [Person2]:  Thank you. Oh, it tastes nice.
[Person1]:  Mum, I am so excited that I don't want to go to bed. [Person2]:  John, I know you will go out on a picnic with your classmates. But you should try to fall asleep; otherwise you will not get up on time tomorrow morning.
[Person1]:  Good morning. Sit down please, Mr. Johnson. [Person2]:  Thank you, madam. [Person1]:  I have read your letter here. You seemed to have done very well at school. Can you tell me something about your school work? [Person2]:  As you can see, my strongest subjects were arts subjects. My best subject was history and my second best was geography. However, my favorite subject was math, and the results I got in the math paper were quite reasonable. [Person1]:  That's true. Now, can you tell me why you think these subjects will help you in this job? [Person2]:  Well, madam, I understand that you manufacture computers, prepare software, and advise clients on how to use them. Is that right? [Person1]:  That's right. [Person2]:  And I've been told that working with computers needs a logical mind rather than great skills in mathematics. That's especially true, I believe, when it comes to writing programs. So I think my results show that I have some ability in logic and in mathematics as well. [Person1]:  So, you would like to write material for computers, would you? [Person2]:  Yes, madam. That's what interests me most about computers - writing programs, but I think the computer industry itself is still expanding enormously. I'm sure that career prospects in the industry would be very good no matter what sort of job I went into. [Person1]:  I see, well, thank you. I've enjoyed our talk. We'll be writing to you. [Person2]:  Thank you, madam. Good morning.
[Person1]:  Would you show me this brooch? [Person2]:  Yes, I would. [Person1]:  What is this made of? [Person2]:  It's sapphire. We have only one brooch of this type. Will you try it on? [Person1]:  Yes, I will. But how much is it? [Person2]:  Only 700 yuan. [Person1]:  It's expensive for me. [Person2]:  How about this one? This is 500 yuan and the same kind of material as that one. [Person1]:  It is genuine, isn't it? [Person2]:  Oh, yes. Any kind of goods are dependable as our shop is well-known throughout the city.
[Person1]:  There are many interesting stories about how a baby learns to say its first word. Now Mike, would you like to share your story with us? [Person2]:  OK, here's my story, I was about 18 months old I think and I had just started to say my first word. Every time a truck went by, I would shout a word that sounded like a track, but to everyone else, it sounded nothing like it. My parents tried to correct me, but failed. Then, about three months later, we traveled to New York, as we were waiting for our plane at the air?port. I looked out of a huge window, at that very moment I saw the largest truck in the world, I had to tell someone about this. I turned to my father who was standing next to about a thousand people waiting for the very flight and screamed 'Track! Track!' My father tried hard to shut me up, but I was so excited, I kept screaming my special word. My poor mother decided she didn't know this baby and then ran into the ladies-room where she hid until I finally stopped. Well, I learned how to say truck correctly, and soon I was talking like a normal child. However, my parents will never forget the very first word I produced in my life.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, I've been waiting my main dish for quite a time.  [Person2]:  Yes sir, just a minute, please. I'll check with the kitchen. Thank you for waiting. It takes another 10 to 15 minutes, I'm afraid. I have an appointment in half an hour.  [Person1]:  I see.  [Person2]:  Do you have anything else I can have instead?  [Person1]:  Well sir, yes. How about this stew? We can serve you at once.  [Person2]:  I'll take this stew then. 
[Person1]:  We are so excited to have you here, Miss Calvin. Thank you for answering some questions and for signing our customers books. [Person2]:  No problem. I love meeting the people who read my books. [Person1]:  So how did you think of the idea for this book? [Person2]:  About 4 years ago, I was taking my dog for a walk. When I saw a very beautiful bird, I started thinking about birds and decided to read about them at the library. I became very interested in birds, and that's how I decided to create the main character in my book. He is a scientist who studies birds. [Person1]:  How long did it take you to write the book? [Person2]:  I wrote the book in about 2 years. I only spent 3 months thinking of the story, but it took much longer to write it. [Person1]:  Do you ever worry you won't be able to think of another idea for a book? [Person2]:  All the time, but I always think of more ideas as soon as I finish with the book I'm writing. Reading the newspaper helps me think of ideas. Taking long showers also helps me think of ideas.
[Person1]:  Hi Sue it's me. [Person2]:  Well hello, where have you been all day Steve? Mister Smith asked me this morning where you were, but he didn't seem to be looking for you or anything. [Person1]:  What did you say? [Person2]:  I told him that I didn't know. He seemed very busy, as managers always are. Are you OK? [Person1]:  I'm sorry I didn't call you this morning. I've had a cold since Saturday. I haven't eaten much these days, it, it has made me feel really weak. But I'll probably be there tomorrow. [Person2]:  Alright we'll go on a business trip next week and don't worry. You should go see a doctor Steve. [Person1]:  Thanks, but I'm getting better now. [Person2]:  Take care then, bye. [Person1]:  Bye bye, Sue.
[Person1]:  I'm trying to decide what school to apply for. [Person2]:  Are you thinking about a public school or a private one? [Person1]:  I'm not sure. What's the difference between them? [Person2]:  Public schools are usually state funded, whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere. [Person1]:  Which is better? [Person2]:  One isn't necessarily better than the other. It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers. [Person1]:  I hear you have to wear uniforms at private schools. [Person2]:  Yeah, sometimes.
[Person1]:  Good morning, what seems to be the problem? [Person2]:  Good morning, Mrs. Brown. I have a cough and a fever and I feel very tired all the time. [Person1]:  And how long have you been feeling like this? [Person2]:  Three days now. [Person1]:  Let me have a look. Open your mouth, please. Wider, please. Now say 'Ah'. [Person2]:  Ah. [Person1]:  Now take your shirt off, please. Breathe in, breathe out. OK, you can put your shirt back on now. [Person2]:  What seems to be the problem? Do I suffer from bird flu or is there something wrong with my lung? [Person1]:  Oh, no. Don't be so nervous. You just have a bad cold. Do you work in an air conditioned office? [Person2]:  Yes, I do. [Person1]:  I thought so. I see many people who work in air conditioned offices. It's the air conditioning, you see. it's really not very good for your health. [Person2]:  So what would you suggest, doctor? [Person1]:  I suggest you get out of the office as regularly as possible. Walk around and get some fresh air. That will help. You also need to get more exercise. Do you play any sports? [Person2]:  I sometimes play tennis in summer. But to be honest, I'm too busy to get regular exercised. [Person1]:  Then I suggest you try playing more often, say, once a week. [Person2]:  OK, no problem. Thank you doctor. Bye. [Person1]:  Bye.
[Person1]:  Hi, Sarah. How's your speech for Professor Grey's class next Monday? [Person2]:  Actually, I'm a bit worried. [Person1]:  Why should you? What's going on? [Person2]:  You know, what I chose to talk about is British history. [Person1]:  Really? That is a big topic. [Person2]:  Yes. There are so many things to cover. I just can't see how to do it in a 3 minute speech.
[Person1]:  I haven't told you what happened yet, have I? [Person2]:  I haven't heard anything. [Person1]:  My boss offered me a promotion, and I took it. [Person2]:  Are you serious? [Person1]:  Yes, I am really excited. [Person2]:  That's great. Congratulations. [Person1]:  I appreciate that. [Person2]:  You have no idea how happy I am for you. [Person1]:  For real? [Person2]:  I believe you were the best choice for that promotion. I really do.
[Person1]:  Have you got your invitation yet? [Person2]:  My invitation? No, I haven't. My invitation to what? [Person1]:  The house warming party. [Person2]:  Whose house warming party is it? [Person1]:  Tom and Bill Smith. They are both working now you know? And they've bought a new house. [Person2]:  Oh, they have? I didn't know. I haven't seen Tom lately. [Person1]:  It's out in the suburbs. [Person2]:  Have you seen the house? [Person1]:  Yes, I have. I went out with them last weekend. [Person2]:  Is it nice? [Person1]:  Yes, it is. There are three bedrooms, a living room, a dining room, and a big kitchen. [Person2]:  There's also a garden. [Person1]:  Well, that does sound nice. Have they moved in yet? [Person2]:  They are moving today. Tom's taken the day off. He's rented a truck, and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight. [Person1]:  When are they going to have the party? [Person2]:  Next Saturday night. You should get your invitation today or tomorrow. [Person1]:  Wow, that would be something to look forward to.
[Person1]:  Why have you changed your job so frequently? [Person2]:  My first job was in a well-established company where the division of labour was very clear. I do not have more chances to enrich my experience. Then I got an opportunity to really broaden my experience with a new company that was starting up, but unfortunately, they closed their service in three months'time. I have worked in my present company for a considerable length of time and enjoy the job I am doing now, but I think I have accumulated enough experience to take up more challenging post in a much larger and diversified company where I could make solid contribution.
[Person1]:  Is there anything I can do for you, Mr. King? [Person2]:  I'm leaving for Shanghai tomorrow morning. When do I have to settle my bill?

By the way, do you have any comment to make on our hotel? [Person2]:  I have had a good stay here. Your service is wonderful. I'm very satisfied with it. [Person1]:  Thank you for your compliments. You're welcome to our hotel again. [Person2]:  OK, I will.
[Person1]:  My German teacher thought it would be a good idea to have German pen friends to write to in German. [Person2]:  What a great idea! Now you have a friendly audience to practice with! [Person1]:  The only thing is that my pen friend will be writing in English. [Person2]:  Oh, he wants to practice his language skills, too. [Person1]:  That's right. And there is another pen friend that I'll be writing too. Her name is Olga. [Person2]:  Maybe Olga can introduce you to some of her friends who can write to you in German and you can do the same for her with your friends to write her in English. [Person1]:  That's a great idea! Why didn't I think of that? [Person2]:  I don't know, but you know how to surround yourself with great friends!
[Person1]:  Valerie! Hi! Wow how have you been? It's been such a long time! [Person2]:  Darlene! Indeed, it's been a while! How have you been? Wow, you look amazing! I love what you'Ve done with your hair! [Person1]:  Really? Thanks! I went to that hair salon that you told me about, but enough about me! Look at you! You haven't aged a day since the last time I saw you! What is your secret! [Person2]:  Ha ha, come on! Well, I'Ve been watching what I eat, and working out three times a week. By the way, I heard your son recently graduated! [Person1]:  Yes, my little Paul is finally a doctor. They grow up so fast you know. [Person2]:  He is such a handsome guy. He gets his looks from his mother of course! [Person1]:  Thank you! What about your daughter, Pamela? I heard she has passed the bar exam and married recently. [Person2]:  Oh yes. She had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel Mexico and we all attended. [Person1]:  Such a lovely girl. I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday! [Person2]:  But of course! Well, it's been great talking to you, but I have to get going. [Person1]:  Same here! We will catch up soon, maybe over coffee! [Person2]:  That would be great! Give me a call! [Person1]:  See you soon! Bye! Uhmm. Finally it's over. . . I can't stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, could you tell me how much is the lipstick? [Person2]:  It costs only 25 yuan. [Person1]:  Oh, it's too expensive. Can't you make it any cheaper? [Person2]:  The price is reasonable because the quality is super. [Person1]:  But the price is too high. [Person2]:  How much would you like it to be, then? [Person1]:  What about 15 yuan? [Person2]:  Let's meet half way, 20 yuan, OK? [Person1]:  All right, I'll take it. [Person2]:  I think you've got a real bargain. [Person1]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  I like the Honda Accord you showed me before. I think it's more practical for my needs. [Person2]:  Alright, sir. You are making a good choice. Honda has made a lot of design improvements in the new Accord. [Person1]:  What does it come with standard? [Person2]:  On all our new cars, the standards includeair conditioning, anti-lock brakes, air bags, and an AM / FM stereo with a CD player. But on the Accord, there is another standard item as well. The Accord com [Person1]:  Cruise control? I don't like that. [Person2]:  Why not, sir? [Person1]:  I think it's dangerous. What if I can't turn it off? [Person2]:  Well, sir, I know some of our customers are concerned about cruise control. But Honda has never had a single cruise control malfunction that led to an accident. [Person1]:  I wish it didn't have cruise control. My wife doesn't like it either. [Person2]:  You know, sir, you don't have to use it. You can turn it on or off. If you don't want to use it, you just never turn it on. [Person1]:  I suppose. And what about the sunroof? Is that standard? [Person2]:  No, the sunroof is optional, sir. [Person1]:  I see. Another important question is the time I can get this car. I need a new car rather soon. [Person2]:  Well, I can say that the new models will be here in August. If you order one now, we will have it for you in August. [Person1]:  That's good enough, I think. What colors does the new Accord come in? [Person2]:  We have this new model in red, white, black, or silver. These are the standard colors. Of course you could specially order from various other colors too. [Person1]:  My brother has last year's Accord. And his car is a kind of soft purple color mixed with silver. I really like that color. I wonder if I can get that color on my Accord. [Person2]:  I know the color you mean. Is this it, sir? [Person1]:  Yes, I think that's it. Can I get that on the Accord? [Person2]:  Yes, you can. That color is very popular with Honda buyers. So we've kept it available. [Person1]:  Well, I think I want to order the new Accord then. It looks like an excellent car. [Person2]:  You have made a good choice, sir. I drive an Accord myself. They are very solidly built machines, very reliable. [Person1]:  Yes, I know. I think Honda is the most reliable car on the road. I would never change to anything else. The Honda I have now almost never has service problems. It runs smooth as silk. [Person2]:  Alright, sir. I will get the paperwork ready for you. Just a moment.
[Person1]:  I'd like to have a berth ticket to Shanghai. [Person2]:  Which train do you want? [Person1]:  The 19 [Person2]:  Sorry.

[Person1]:  Pardon me. I need an old music box. [Person2]:  Exactly how old a box do you want? [Person1]:  Actually, I was thinking about something from the 1920s. [Person2]:  We still have six left. [Person1]:  Do any of the boxes have dancing figures? [Person2]:  Dancing figures are quite popular. Two of the boxes have them. [Person1]:  I love the dancing figures. I'll take this music box. [Person2]:  Yes, I think you'll be very satisfied with that one. [Person1]:  I was wondering, does this come with any kind of warranty? [Person2]:  No. But if something goes wrong with it, I know someone who repairs these things. [Person1]:  I was just hoping. [Person2]:  It's amazing that these things still work as well as they do.
[Person1]:  I'm planning on going to the market soon. [Person2]:  What are you buying? [Person1]:  I don't know what we need. [Person2]:  I can check for you, if you'd like. [Person1]:  I'll make a list. [Person2]:  First, we need eggs, milk, and bread. [Person1]:  OK! Do we need any meat? [Person2]:  How about some chicken, ground beef, and some steak. [Person1]:  What else do we need? [Person2]:  Get some snack foods, too, dude. [Person1]:  Is there anything else that we need? [Person2]:  No, but if you can think of anything else, just get it.
[Person1]:  Are you being served, sir? [Person2]:  No, not yet. I just want a haircut. [Person1]:  Will you sit here, please? How would you like it cut? [Person2]:  I want it short.

I like it to be very short all over. Do you see what I mean? [Person1]:  Oh, I see. You like the Chinese style, don't you? [Person2]:  Yes, in the Chinese style.

[Person1]:  I'm from Channel 5 News. [Person2]:  How's it going? [Person1]:  I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions. [Person2]:  Ask away. [Person1]:  First of all, did you vote today? [Person2]:  I already voted. [Person1]:  Who did you vote for? [Person2]:  I'm not going to tell you. [Person1]:  Why not? [Person2]:  My vote is personal.

You see, my friend also has an account with you and also enjoys shopping on the Internet. She recommended I sign up for this service too. [Person1]:  That was a wise decision, if I may say so. Our Personal Internet Banking Service offers online shopping transactions, payment of household bills online, account management. . . [Person2]:  I will probably just use it for online shopping. At the moment, I have to meet the seller in person and pay cash, if it's a local seller. [Person1]:  This will fix all of that for you. If you use our online payment service, the money will come straight out of your account and go directly into the seller's account, in a secure way.
[Person1]:  You're listening to BBC English programme, aren't you? [Person2]:  Yes, join us, will you? [Person1]:  All right, but it is a bit too difficult for me to understand. [Person2]:  Don't worry. Listen to it more often, and you are sure to make progress. As the proverb goes, 'Where there is a will, there is a way.' [Person1]:  Thank you for your advice. [Person2]:  Don't mention it.
[Person1]:  Here it is...Friday night. Do you want to go dancing? [Person2]:  Well, not really. I'm kind of tired. I had a pretty hard week. But how about going out to listen to some music? [Person1]:  How about a little light jazz? [Person2]:  Yeah. That sounds nice. [Person1]:  What about the Club Blue Note? [Person2]:  I've never heard of it. [Person1]:  My office manager was there last week. He said both the food and the music were wonderful. [Person2]:  Really? What kind of food do they serve? [Person1]:  Mostly sandwiches and salads. [Person2]:  Is it expensive? [Person1]:  He said the prices were very good. So, do you feel like trying it? [Person2]:  I'd love to! I'll just get my coat.
[Person1]:  Don't turn the dishwasher on! The baby just fell asleep. I need a break! I'm exhausted from cooking soup and baking cookies all morning. [Person2]:  Oh! I'll run it later, then. Let's sit outside and read while she sleeps.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, how can I get to the Riverside Theater? [Person2]:  Sorry I didn't earth what you said. [Person1]:  Please show me where the Riverside Theater is. [Person2]:  Can you speak French? I'm a foreigner here. [Person1]:  Oh, wonderful! I come from Paris. Is there a Riverside Theater? [Person2]:  OK, let me show you. Walk along the river and take the fourth turn on the left and go down until you reach the second traffic light. Tuna fight, at the end of the road, you'll see the theater. [Person1]:  Good heavens! What a long way! [Person2]:  Yes, you can take a taxi if you can't remember what I told you or if you don't want to walk a long way. [Person1]:  Well, I like walking. It's a fine day for walking, isn't it? And Shakespeare's play is worth such a day and such a long way! [Person2]:  It sounds reasonable. I like Shakespeare! [Person1]:  Thank you very much. [Person2]:  It's a pleasure.
[Person1]:  Every year, the South has the floods. It is an act of God.  [Person2]:  Do you really think so?  [Person1]:  Yeah, you have some other ideas?  [Person2]:  I think, in some way it is an act of God, but in another way, it just is caused by us.  [Person1]:  For example?  [Person2]:  We didn't pay attention to the environment, cut down trees and polluted the air.  [Person1]:  Oh, I see. Fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things. 
[Person1]:  Hi, Francis, morning! How are you doing today?  [Person2]:  I had a bad start of the day. I was stuck in a bad traffic jam on my way and I missed my morning meeting.  [Person1]:  Indeed, I agree that is not a good start. How about the meeting? You missed anything important?  [Person2]:  It is ok. My boss briefs me later on.  [Person1]:  Was he unhappy with you not attending the meeting?  [Person2]:  Err, kind of. You know this traffic jam is really bad with so many new cars hitting the streets these days. 
[Person1]:  May, is this the Hall of Ancient China? [Person2]:  Yes. Look at these historical relics here, amazing! [Person1]:  Why are they all in glass boxes? [Person2]:  For protection. Some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air. [Person1]:  So there isn't air in the glass boxes? [Person2]:  No, there isn't. They are all vacuumed. [Person1]:  I wonder how old these things are, thousands of years? [Person2]:  Yeah, they all come from a very ancient time. [Person1]:  Hey, look at the three-leg cup. I've seen it on TV. [Person2]:  The bronze cup was made 4, 000 years ago. It's priceless! [Person1]:  Yeah, it has no value at all. Who will use this cup today? [Person2]:  Danny, priceless means so valuable that you can't put a price on it. [Person1]:  Oh, it does?
[Person1]:  Good morning. My name's Jason Smith. [Person2]:  Ah, good morning, Mr. Smith. Nice to meet you. I'm Peter Anderson from Personnel. Do sit down. [Person1]:  Thank you very much. [Person2]:  Now, have you brought your curriculum vitae with you? [Person1]:  Oh, my CV. Yes, here it s. There are three copies. [Person2]:  Have you brought your certificates as well? [Person1]:  No, I haven't. I'm awfully sorry. Can I send them to you? [Person2]:  Yes, that'll be all right. Well, please tell me about your working experience. [Person1]:  I haven't been involved in international business, so I don't have any experiences, but I am diligent and I learn very fast. [Person2]:  OK, so do you think you can make yourself easily understood in English? [Person1]:  Yes, in most circumstances. [Person2]:  Are you available for business travel? [Person1]:  Yes, I am young, and unmarried. So it's no problem for me to travel frequently. [Person2]:  OK. You are good. Hope to see you next time. I'll call you if you get picked for next test. [Person1]:  Thank you very much. I'm looking forward to your call.
[Person1]:  I have made up my mind. I am getting a tattoo. [Person2]:  Really? Are you sure? [Person1]:  Yeah! Why not? They are trendy and look great! I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back. [Person2]:  Yeah but, it is something that you will have forever! They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment. On top of all that, I have heard it hurts a lot! [Person1]:  Really? [Person2]:  Of course! They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink. [Person1]:  Oh, I didn't know that! I thought they just paint it on your skin or something. [Person2]:  I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos. Also, find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles, and that the place is hygienic. [Person1]:  Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing!
[Person1]:  What can I do for you? [Person2]:  I need a passport. [Person1]:  You can apply for one here. [Person2]:  When can I do that? [Person1]:  If you like, you can apply right now. [Person2]:  That would be great. [Person1]:  I'm going to need you to complete this application. [Person2]:  What else do I have to do? [Person1]:  Then I will take your picture for your passport. [Person2]:  How long will it take? [Person1]:  Your passport will be ready in a few weeks. [Person2]:  Thank you. That's perfect timing.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, Is there an airline flying to New York this afternoon? [Person2]:  Sorry, sir. I can't sell you a ticket. Our computer is down. [Person1]:  If your computer is down, just write me a ticket. [Person2]:  Sorry, I can't. The computer is the only one allowed doing so. [Person1]:  Hmm... Then what do all you people do? [Person2]:  We give the computer the information about your trip, and then it tells us whether you can fly with us or not. [Person1]:  So when it goes down, you go down with it. [Person2]:  I am truly sorry, sir. But there is nothing I can do. [Person1]:  How long will the computer be down? [Person2]:  Sorry, I've got no idea. Sometimes it's down for 10 minutes; sometimes for two hours. There's no way we can find out without asking the computer, and since it's down, it won't answer us. [Person1]:  Well, let's forget the computer. Is there any other airline flying to New York within the next few hours? [Person2]:  I wouldn't know. Only the computer knows. It just can't tell me.
[Person1]:  I'm going to the park to play baseball with the guys. [Person2]:  But you promised to play chess with me this afternoon. [Person1]:  Yeah, but that was before the guys ask me to join the team. [Person2]:  So what? [Person1]:  You know how much I want to be on the team, and now there is an opening for me. If I don't go to practise today. They'll get someone else and I'll miss my chance. [Person2]:  I don't care about baseball. You know I need to practice for the chess championship and you promised to help with me if I washed the dishes for you last Sunday, and I did. [Person1]:  I know, and I will. [Person2]:  When? [Person1]:  After baseball practice. [Person2]:  And then, it'll be dinner time, then homework, and then your Show is on. You are going to break your promise. [Person1]:  No, I won't. I'm going to skip TV tonight and work on your chess game with you if that's ok with you. [Person2]:  Well, I'd rather do it the way we set up. But if you promise to give me your best game, it's ok with me. [Person1]:  No problem, I'll play as hard as I can and give you an extra game to say thanks.
[Person1]:  This is the last of the milk. [Person2]:  I know. I intent to go to the store today. [Person1]:  Would you get some that new cereal we saw advertise on TV. [Person2]:  Which one? [Person1]:  You know. The one with the silly art about how advisements have jump up and down. [Person2]:  Oh, you mean kikois. [Person1]:  Yeah, That's the one. [Person2]:  Well. I'll see, sometimes the store don't have some one of new kinds of cereal.
[Person1]:  what are you doing? [Person2]:  I'm just trying to complete today's crossword puzzle. Whenever I get the time, I like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper. [Person1]:  you really like brains that make you think, don't you? [Person2]:  I guess you could say that. What kind of games do you like? [Person1]:  I guess the games I like the most are the ones that I'm good at! [Person2]:  Doesn't everyone? Which games are those? [Person1]:  Well, I like to play darts. Whenever I go to a bar, I usually play for a few hours. [Person2]:  Did you play a lot of games when you were little? [Person1]:  My parents used to love to play checkers and dominoes. We used to have family tournaments every weekend. [Person2]:  Do you still like playing those games? [Person1]:  Not at all. I never really did, to be honest. What about you? Did your family used to play games together? [Person2]:  Everyone in my family really enjoys playing card games. [Person1]:  Some of my friends play cards on the internet. Have you ever tried that? [Person2]:  No, I prefer to play with people I know. [Person1]:  How about mah-jong? [Person2]:  It's a popular game with some people, but I've never played it. [Person1]:  I thought everyone in your country were experts at mah-jong! [Person2]:  I hate to disappoint you, but unlike what most people think, we aren't all exactly the same!
[Person1]:  Hi, Gary. How handsome you are in the blue coat! [Person2]:  Thank you. I'm very glad to hear that. [Person1]:  I like your new coat very much. Where did you get it? [Person2]:  Well, I got it from the department store where there are many clothes, from shirt to skirt, from jacket to coat. [Person1]:  Oh. I know that store. Clothes there are expensive for me. How much did it cost you? [Person2]:  Not as much as the saleswoman asked for. She wanted $90. [Person1]:  So. how much did you pay for it in the end? [Person2]:  I tried to make her bring down to half the price. [Person1]:  Wow! How smart you are! In fact, I have been attracted by a cool hat in that store for a long time. Can you help me bring its price down? [Person2]:  I'm not sure, but I can have a try. [Person1]:  Then, thank you very much.
[Person1]:  I'm in charge of buying the fruit for the children at our church. I'm so happy to find that apples and grapes are in season. Give me two dozens of each. [Person2]:  I hope that they're as good as they look.
[Person1]:  How is the weather today? [Person2]:  It's very cold and wet. [Person1]:  Are the winters like this every year in this place? [Person2]:  Pretty much. But it was a little colder last year. [Person1]:  Now I know why people here have thick clothes on. [Person2]:  What is the weather like in winter in your country? [Person1]:  It's quite different from yours. It's warm and hot in my hometown all year round. [Person2]:  You are very lucky then. [Person1]:  Well, some people in my country want to have your weather.
[Person1]:  Eastern Airlines Agency. Good Morning. [Person2]:  Good Morning. I want to book a round-trip ticket. [Person1]:  Where are you flying from, and what's your destination, sir? [Person2]:  From Montreal to Toronto. [Person1]:  What day do you want to fly? [Person2]:  I want to leave on Monday the 24th and return on Friday. Do you have any flights in the afternoon? [Person1]:  Yes, we do. By the way, will that be first class or economy class? How many people are there in your party? [Person2]:  Just myself. And I'd like economy class. [Person1]:  All right, there are seats still available. Would you prefer a window, aisle or center seat? [Person2]:  Window, please. Thank you.
[Person1]:  May I help you, sir? [Person2]:  Yes, please. I want to buy a personal gift for my brother. He's taking a trip to South America. [Person1]:  Is he going by ship or plane? [Person2]:  He,s flying. My gift will have to be something light in weight. What can you suggest? [Person1]:  What about this tie? It's made of pure silk. [Person2]:  My sister already gave him one. I'd like something unusual. Let me look around...oh, that clock looks nice, but... [Person1]:  Hey,here is a gift for the man who has everything. [Person2]:  Oh,a folding toothbrush! That's a wonderful idea! I'll take it.
[Person1]:  Did you have any kind of punishment in your life and studies?  [Person2]:  Yes, just once.  [Person1]:  What was the reason?  [Person2]:  I once played truant when I was in college because I intended to organize a donation activity for the disaster-hit areas in Sichuan. 
[Person1]:  Do you want your television repaired? [Person2]:  Yes, but not by the man you suggested. [Person1]:  Why not? The repairmen are very good and the charges are so reasonable. [Person2]:  That may be, but I couldn't find the place. [Person1]:  But you couldn't miss it. I told you it is at the first right after the railroad bridge. [Person2]:  I took that. I went to the end of the road. There is no such place. [Person1]:  Wait a minute. Perhaps it is the second right. Yes, I think it is. [Person2]:  I should have known, whenever someone says 'You can't miss it', you can be sure that you won't find it.
[Person1]:  I'm absolutely stuffed. I don't think I've ever eaten so much at one sitting.  [Person2]:  same here. How did we manage to eat seven jin of dumplings?  [Person1]:  well, I had five of them. the bill, please.  [Person3]:  that will be 71 yuan.  [Person2]:  here's 80. keep the change.  [Person3]:  I'm sorry, sir?  [Person2]:  he means, 'Could we get the change please? '  [Person3]:  of course, one moment please.  [Person2]:  what did you mean when you said 'keep the change'?  [Person1]:  it's called a 'tip'. Think of it as a gift given to the server to show appreciation for their good service. It's common practice in the States. 
[Person1]:  I hear you bought a new house in the northern suburbs.  [Person2]:  That's right, we bought it the same day we came on the market.  [Person1]:  What kind of house is it?  [Person2]:  It's a wonderful Spanish style.  [Person1]:  Oh, I love the roof tiles on Spanish style houses.  [Person2]:  And it's a bargaining. A house like this in river side costs double the price.  [Person1]:  Great, is it a two bedroom house?  [Person2]:  No, it has three bedrooms and three beds, and has a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling. There's a two-car garage.  [Person1]:  That's a nice area too. It'll be a good investment for you.  [Person2]:  Yeas, when will you buy a house?  [Person1]:  Not untill the end of this year, you know, just before my wedding.  [Person2]:  Right, congratulations.  [Person1]:  Thank you. 
[Person1]:  Hello, my name is Peter Jones. I'm your new neighbor. I just moved in next door. [Person2]:  Oh, nice to meet you. My name is Miss James. I hope you enjoy living here. [Person1]:  I hope so, too. You know when we were considering whether to buy the house, Mr. Johnson, the housing agent told us that jogging was very popular here. I am a big fan of jogging. I used to go jogging every day in my old neighborhood. [Person2]:  Aah, yes. Many people here love to jog. I go jogging twice a week. [Person1]:  Can you tell me a good place to go jogging near here? [Person2]:  Sure, the long coast path along the beach is a perfect place for jogging. [Person1]:  Coast path. Sounds nice. Is it far from here? Can I walk there? [Person2]:  Yes, it's only a 5 minute ride from here. [Person1]:  Oh, I see. Anything in particular I should know about jogging there? [Person2]:  Emm, yeah, just be sure to wear sunglasses there. The sunlight there is very bright and it can be hurt on your eyes. [Person1]:  Thanks for the advice. So are there any other activities to do there on the beach? [Person2]:  Oh, yes, beach volleyball is also very popular. A lot of people play there on the beach. [Person1]:  Wow, that's wonderful. It looks like we're going to have a lot of fun here in the neighborhood. [Person2]:  Yes, I'm sure you will.
[Person1]:  Do you have anything particular on this evening? [Person2]:  No, I've got a lot of time to kill. [Person1]:  Well, then, won't you come over to dinner and have a game of mahjong afterwards? [Person2]:  With pleasure. [Person1]:  You are not so eager about majang before. [Person2]:  That's because I didn't know the fun of playing it then. Why is majang? Such a popular game, do you know? [Person1]:  I've got no idea. I only know that foreigners are beginning to take an interest in it, besides their old card games. [Person2]:  That's right. Some of them are already experts. [Person1]:  Indeed they are. But the cham about majang is once you're interested in it, you can't shut it off. [Person2]:  Yes, once I went crazy over other hobbies such as stamp collecting and reading, but I find them very boring now. [Person1]:  I'm sure your former hobbies are more beneficial. [Person2]:  I can't deny that and I can't help it, either. [Person1]:  The bells ringing. That must be our partners.
[Person1]:  Jack, I was just wondering if you'd like to go out this Friday. [Person2]:  Oh, Rose. I haven't seen you since we last met at our classmates party. What are you going to do? [Person1]:  Well, I was thinking if we could go to a movie after a western dinner. [Person2]:  That sounds like fun. [Person1]:  Of course. We can do something else if you'd like. [Person2]:  No, no. The movie sounds great. [Person1]:  Well. How are we going? By bus or subway? [Person2]:  Uh, isn't it better if I drive to pick you up? [Person1]:  That's very kind of you. What time shall we start off? [Person2]:  How about 7 [Person1]:  Good. Let's make it.
[Person1]:  Food is less expensive in a cafeteria, because you serve yourself. [Person2]:  How to do it? [Person1]:  Just pick up a tray, then put a knife, a fork, a spoon and a paper napkin on it and stand in the line. [Person2]:  How long will it take to reach the buffet? [Person1]:  Not long, because people rush for lunch. [Person2]:  The line sure does move fast. [Person1]:  Tell the man behind the counter what you want. [Person2]:  OK. I like that green vegetable but I don't know how to call it. [Person1]:  Just point to it if you don't know the name. [Person2]:  All right.
[Person1]:  How far do we have to go? [Person2]:  About 50 miles. [Person1]:  The traffic is not very heavy on this high way, is it? So I ' m sure we ' ll make it. [Person2]:  No, but we ' Ve got a hurry. It will be the rush hour soon. [Person1]:  Don ' t worry. There ' s plenty of time yet. [Person2]:  But it ' s Friday today. This road is always jam packed during the weekend, isn ' t it? [Person1]:  Right.
[Person1]:  What reason do you have for missing school? [Person2]:  I was sick. [Person1]:  How were you sick? [Person2]:  I had a stomachache. [Person1]:  Did it get any better? [Person2]:  I'm still feeling under the weather. [Person1]:  Would you like anything for your stomach? [Person2]:  I took something earlier. [Person1]:  Get better. [Person2]:  Thanks a lot.
[Person1]:  Mark, you are not telling me the truth. Now why? [Person2]:  Promise you are not going to be angry? [Person1]:  Yes, all right. So why? Go on then. Say it. Oh, really, Mark. I promise I'm not going to be angry. Now why were you late? [Person2]:  I forgot. [Person1]:  You forgot? You. . . [Person2]:  Ah, ah, you promised, and remember?
[Person1]:  Make yourself at home.My house is always open to you.  [Person2]:  I've been looking forward to seeing you.  [Person1]:  Would you care for a drink?  [Person2]:  Just a cup of soda for me,please.  [Person1]:  What are you going to do next month?  [Person2]:  I'm thinking of going to Europe.  [Person1]:  Oh,really? And what are you going to do there?  [Person2]:  Oh,I think I'll just travel around for a while  [Person1]:  Lucky you! 
[Person1]:  Well, I'm sure all our listeners would love to be brought up to date on the latest in tiny televisions. [Person2]:  It's an expanding market, that's for sure, and they seem to be getting smaller every year. [Person1]:  Which countries are dominating the market? [Person2]:  At the moment it's Japan, principally. In the spring of 1982 Sony introduced the Watchman? [Person1]:  Is that the Walkman? [Person2]:  No, the Watchman is a portable black and white TV set with a tiny screen and aerial. [Person1]:  How big is the whole thing? [Person2]:  Oh, I'd say about 35 cm by 12 cm and it weighs only a couple of kilograms. [Person1]:  Was it a success from the start? [Person2]:  Funnily enough, a Sony executive said that no one would want to watch a TV while walking around-and also a slightly larger model could be bought for half the price! [Person1]:  Really? [Person2]:  But, despite this pessimistic view, sales of this model far outnumbered projections. [Person1]:  Well, you never can tell! How big was the initial production? [Person2]:  The company started with 2,000 units per month and increased to 5,000 by the end of 1982, but they still couldn't keep up with the demand. [Person1]:  So I suppose they upped the production levels even higher. [Person2]:  It was much more radical than that! In the spring of 1983 Sony pulled out all the stops and launched the Watchman all over again with a new model. [Person1]:  Oh, what's it like? [Person2]:  Well, it's 20 per cent smaller and the price is 25 percent less... [Person1]:  Mmmm. [Person2]:  and the components were designed from scratch. [Person1]:  And what about production levels? [Person2]:  They quadrupled to 20,000 units a month just for the Japanese market! [Person1]:  Wow! The Watchman certainly seems to have taken off. [Person2]:  Indeed it has. [Person1]:  And I believe there were other Japanese companies as well. [Person2]:  Yes. At the end of 1982 Hattori-that's H-A-T-T-O-R-I--you know, the makers of Seiko watches-well, they unveiled an even smaller TV, around 3era, which is built into a wrist-watch. [Person1]:  Incredible! [Person2]:  It certainly is. The rest of the set is carried separately in your pocket and it's about the size of a packet of kingsize cigarettes. [Person1]:  And how does it work? [Person2]:  It has a liquid crystal display screen. The TV receiver and battery pack fit into your pocket, and they're connected by a cord to the watch. [Person1]:  Is there a headphone? [Person2]:  Oh, yes, that's plugged into the receiver as well. [Person1]:  Seems a bit complicated, that one, with all the wires and bits and pieces. [Person2]:  Yes, it does. [Person1]:  Any other Japanese models? [Person2]:  Yes, Casio-that's C-A-S-I-O. Their latest is a calculator-sized TV about one-third the bulk of the Watchman and with 1983 production figures of 2000 units a month. [Person1]:  I see. [Person2]:  And, according to a spokesman, they hope to match their calculator sales, which are about 25 million units per year. [Person1]:  Very impressive. And no doubt other Japanese companies will jump on the bandwagon. [Person2]:  Most likely. [Person1]:  Now, could you tell us about other countries making these tiny TVs? [Person2]:  Of course. From Sinclair in England there's one similar in size to the Casio, and their production levels were 1 million for 1983. [Person1]:  Obviously they're planning on backing a winner! [Person2]:  How right you are. A representative said they expect a mass-market response, not just a novelty item. [Person1]:  And just which market are the manufactures aiming at? [Person2]:  Mainly the commuters who spend hours going to and from work. These TVs will provide relief from the monotonous train and bus rides. [Person1]:  Well, thank you for keeping us in touch with this extremely popular gadget. [Person2]:  My pleasure, and happy viewing to all of you with those TVs.
[Person1]:  Mr. Wilson, you said you saw the bus crash into the truck. Do you know what caused the accident? [Person2]:  I saw a boy riding his bicycle in the street. The bus driver tried to avoid biting him. He made a sudden turn and lost control the bus.
[Person1]:  Why do you want to be a teacher?  [Person2]:  It's a job I have been dreaming of for many years. While it is difficult, I am convinced that there is nothing more noble and rewarding than this profession.  [Person1]:  Do you know about our school?  [Person2]:  Yes, a little. I know your school is one of the best known in this town. There are about 200 children in the school. 
[Person1]:  Two more miles to go...we have an hour before school starts. Let's take our time. Do you want to stop and get a breakfast sandwich? [Person2]:  We decided to start walking to school for the exercise. We want to get fit. Why would we want to eat a fattening breakfast sandwich? [Person1]:  McDonald's has an egg muffin sandwich that has only 320 calories. What's wrong with that? I bet we walked off 320 calories already. After two more miles, we can probably walk off another 100 calories. [Person2]:  I do need energy. I hardly ate dinner last night. My mom made leg of lamb, and it's definitely not my favorite. In fact, I think I'm going to become a vegetarian. [Person1]:  Good for you! I gave up meat a long time ago. Now, almost all of my meals are salads. Funny thing is, when I make my food, I also make food for my rabbit. We mostly eat the same things now. [Person2]:  My bird eats seeds and berries. We could probably share our meals, too!
[Person1]:  What will you do now? Propose to her.  [Person2]:  Of course I won't chill out. Opportunity knocks only once.  [Person1]:  You should strike while the iron is hot.  [Person2]:  You're right. I will have a talk to her about that. 
[Person1]:  Hi, Li Ming. You look upset. What's the matter?  [Person2]:  There will be a parents' meeting in our class this Saturday and I am worried about it.  [Person1]:  Why? We can leave school earlier that day.  [Person2]:  I didn't do well in last exams. If my father knows it, he will beat me up.  [Person1]:  I can't believe it. My parents never beat me.  [Person2]:  You know that my father is irritable.  [Person1]:  You can ask the teacher for help.  [Person2]:  Good idea. 
[Person1]:  I am having a hard time at my job.  [Person2]:  What's wrong, Julia?  [Person1]:  My colleagues quickly get promotions, while I always get sidelined. I don't know what to do anymore.  [Person2]:  Don't give up so soon.  [Person1]:  But I don't know what else I can do. I am willing to work hard. Sometimes I make mistakes and the boss is not happy.  [Person2]:  Mistakes are just a lessons to learn from.  [Person1]:  Tell that to my boss.  [Person2]:  Do you know Abraham Lincoln?  [Person1]:  Yes.  [Person2]:  He grew up poor in Kentucky and barely had a year of schooling, but he went on to become the President of United States.  [Person1]:  He was also assassinated because of his views.  [Person2]:  He is known as American's greatest president. Do you know why? Because he fought against slavery and secession at a time in history where others were too afraid to do anything. He succeeded because of his ambition and generous spirit.  [Person1]:  Well, if he can become president, then I can at least get a promotion.  [Person2]:  That's the spirit. Never give up on your dream. 
[Person1]:  Hi, Mark. Haven't seen you for ages. How are you doing? [Person2]:  Can't complain. I'm busy with my experiments in the lab, but after work I often play some sports. [Person1]:  Like what? [Person2]:  Like tennis, running and golf. [Person1]:  Golf? That's my favorite game. How often do you play it, Mark? [Person2]:  I usually play about once a month. What about you, Alice? [Person1]:  I play every Sunday. [Person2]:  Where do you go? [Person1]:  The Country Club. Do you know it? [Person2]:  Yes, I was there once. You're going to play next Sunday, I suppose. [Person1]:  Certainly. Listen, why don't you come with me? [Person2]:  I'd love to.
[Person1]:  Paul, let's talk about your work experience in South America. What took you there? Was it to improve your Spanish? [Person2]:  Well, I just wanted to find out more about the way people lived there. My spoken Spanish was already pretty good. In fact, I ended up teaching English there. [Person1]:  I see, how did you do that? [Person2]:  I found an agency that ran volunteer projects. Construction was a choice. Then there was tourism, which I actually chose to do. And then there was work with local farmers, otherwise known as agriculture. [Person1]:  It sounds like a good chance to experience a different kind of life. [Person2]:  Yes, but it was hard for me to be accepted at first. However, when people became more comfortable with me. We really connected with each other in a meaningful way. [Person1]:  That's wonderful. What did you think of the food there? [Person2]:  It was simple. But there was always plenty to eat. [Person1]:  Well, I look forward to hearing more.
[Person1]:  Next, please. May I help you, sir? [Person2]:  Hello, yes, I ' d like to open a bank account. [Person1]:  Certainly, I can can help you with that. What type of account would you like to open? A chequing or a savings account? [Person2]:  What What features do they offer? [Person1]:  Well, if you just take a look here, see, with our chequing account, you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly fee, and our savings account has a higher interest rate, but you must carry a minimum balance of $ 10, 000 dollars. [Person2]:  I see, well, I think I ' m more interested in a chequing account. I like to have easy access to my money. [Person1]:  Alright, then, with this chequing account you ' ll be issued a debit card and a cheque book. Will you require overdraft protection? There is an extra fee for that. [Person2]:  No, that won ' t be necessary. [Person1]:  In that case, I ' ll get you to fill out this paperwork. I ' ll need your social insurance number, and two pieces of government ID. If you could just sign here, and here, and here. we ' ll be all set. Would you like to make a deposit today? [Person2]:  Yes, I ' d like to deposit one billion dollars.
[Person1]:  Would you like to see our new shirts? [Person2]:  Sorry, but I'm not really interested in those things. [Person1]:  But they're very nice, you know. [Person2]:  Really. [Person1]:  And not expensive either. [Person2]:  Oh, I don't care about that. [Person1]:  Everybody is buying them. [Person2]:  Are they? [Person1]:  Yes, they're very fashionable, you see. [Person2]:  I'm afraid I'm not interested in fashion. [Person1]:  I see. [Person2]:  But thank you very much all the same. [Person1]:  Sorry, I couldn't help you.
[Person1]:  Is there a lot of oil and coal in your country? [Person2]:  There is some, but my country is not amongst the leading producers. The oil and coal deposits are in the north of my country. Your country is a big oil producer, isn't it? [Person1]:  Yes, it is. My country is famous for having that natural resources. We also have a lot of natural gas. [Person2]:  We have some too. Do you have a lot of coal? [Person1]:  No coal has been discovered in my country, but there may be undiscovered deposits. We don't have many metal deposits. [Person2]:  There are a few in my country. We have deposit of gold, but they are very small. [Person1]:  When I traveled around your country, I bought some jewellery made from gold from your country. The jewellery told me that there are few gold mines in your country. The gold was found in mountain steams. [Person2]:  That's right. A few people go panning for gold in rivers. [Person1]:  You have many trees in your country. That's another natural resources. [Person2]:  It's a natural resources that we hardly use. Government policy is to conserve those forests. [Person1]:  I see. That's probably a good idea. Too many forest are being destroyed. [Person2]:  Is your country's environment being damaged by the oil industry? [Person1]:  We have some inspections, but it is very hard to avoid pollution when extracting oil. There has been some damage, but it is under control.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, sir. Is there anything I can do for you? [Person2]:  Yes. I'd like to change some money, please. [Person1]:  All right. How much would you like to change? [Person2]:  Let me see. I think maybe 600 USD at least. [Person1]:  Pardon? [Person2]:  Six hundred US dollars. [Person1]:  I'm sorry, sir, after 7 th, July, we would not provide service to change money over 500 dollars a time. [Person2]:  But I am badly in need of the amount. Might I ask you to make an exception for me? [Person1]:  I'm afraid we cannot help you, sir, because that would be violating the regulations. I owe an apology for doing nothing about it. [Person2]:  It's just too bad. I have to leave it as it is, and thank you just the same.
[Person1]:  Hi, taxi. Could you take me to the financial street, please [Person2]:  Pardon, where to, sir? [Person1]:  I want to go to the financial stree. [Person2]:  All right. Hop in, please. [Person1]:  Excuse me, how long does it take to get there? [Person2]:  It usually takes about half an hour. [Person1]:  Oh, does it really a long way to go. [Person2]:  Yes. Moreover, since the street is heavy with traffic this time of day. I'm not sure we can make it. By the way, are you pressed for the time? [Person1]:  No, I'm not. you can just drive slowly and carefully. [Person2]:  OK. [Person1]:  You are very skillful driver. [Person2]:  Thank you. [Person1]:  By the way, is the fair the same for any distance? [Person2]:  No. It versa according to the distance, you can read from the meter. [Person1]:  Oh, I see.
[Person1]:  Good idea! I've heard that the Expo is doing pretty well now, and ads are seen everywhere in the country on all means of media, newspapers, TV, street signs, etc. [Person2]:  Yeah, it's the last world-wide horti-cultural exposition in the century, and one of the grand festivities of cross-century significance held by the China's tourism industry. [Person1]:  what's interesting to see there? [Person2]:  Oh, there's plenty. Flowers and plants from all over the world, of course. Besides, gardening techniques are demonstrated, modern facilities displayed, academic exchanges and seminars organized, and folk performances of different nations shown almost every day. [Person1]:  I visited the First International Flower Festival in the city last year, and was impressed with so many beautiful flowers! [Person2]:  Oh, can't compare with the Kunming Expo at all! The Kunming Expo covers an area of 218 hectares, and more than 9000 flower enterprises from over 100 countries and regions are invited to participate in the Expo. [Person1]:  It would be a rare occasion to be able to appreciate so many fine species of Chinese and foreign flowers fully blooming in one park! [Person2]:  Far more than that, I dare to say! Inland provinces and cities, Hong Kong and Macao, as well as many countries and regions in the world have an exhibition area of their own to display their unique flowers and plants. Each month there's a special day for a particular country or region, and folk performances are given. You will feel it a great pity if you missile Kunming Expo.

It tells a story about a fight between cats and dogs. [Person2]:  Sounds interesting. [Person1]:  Yes. In fact, it is wonderful. All the actors in the film are real dogs and cats, not cartoons.

[Person1]:  Ah, no, let me guess. You want to sell a subscription to the newspaper or a great deal on airfare to Hawaii, right? [Well, ...]. Or, you want to offer me an unbelievable bargain on flamenco dance lessons. [Person2]:  No, no, actually ... Mr. Jones. [Huh?] Oh, sorry. That was the last guy. [Ah, great.] Uh, we want to offer you a free trial membership to our sports club downtown at the introductory price of $39.95 ... [Person1]:  Thirty-nine ninety-five?!? I thought you said free! Uh, listen. I'm not interested. [Person2]:  Well, it includes unlimited access to all our facilities, including the gym, weight room, racketball courts, and swimming pool.

Like I said, I'll pass this time. And please put me on your 'don't call' list. [Person2]:  Okay. It'll take between four and six months before your name will be removed from our database.

[Person1]:  I'm sorry. I'm late. [Person2]:  That's all right. John. My house is not that easy to find. But you know you wouldn't have gotten lost if you had a smart car. [Person1]:  A smart car? What's that? [Person2]:  I just read a magazine article about some new technology that can make a car smart. One device is a computerized map display and an artificial voice. You just enter the address for where you want to go and the voice will tell you how to get there,street by street. [Person1]:  Hey, that's just like my brother. He never gets lost and he's always telling me the best route. So what else will the smart cars be able to do? [Person2]:  Well, the article says there'll be a device with read-on warning systems that will warn drivers with a long signal if they're getting too close to other cars. And they will even put on brakes if the drivers don't. [Person1]:  Tell me, Shelly. Will these cars be smart enough to fill themselves up with gas? [Person2]:  Not by now. Why do you ask? [Person1]:  I'm not late because I got lost. I'm late because I ran out of gas on the way over there.
[Person1]:  Please sit down. Let's see. You're Mr. Brown, is that right? [Person2]:  Right. I'll graduate from college next June. [Person1]:  Have you ever done any work in this field? [Person2]:  No, never. We did some practice work in class. [Person1]:  You seem to be doing well at college. What kind of pay do you hope to get? [Person2]:  From what I've read, it seems that the pay at the beginning would, be around $12,000 a year. [Person1]:  Here we would start at $10,500 for the first year of training. Then you would get $15,000. After that it would depend on how well you work. [Person2]:  That sounds fair enough. What about other things, like vacation? [Person1]:  Those are all explained in this paper. You can take it along and look at it at home. [Person2]:  Do you really think I can get a job here? I really hope that I can work here. But I guess I'll just have to go home and wait. [Person1]:  Well, I'm talking to three people today and four tomorrow. The company will be hiring two people. You'll hear sometime next month. Good luck and thanks for coming today.
[Person1]:  Is that you, Dave? Oh, my gosh! The backstabber who left us to work for the evil WebTracker!  [Person2]:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hi, Mary. How are you?  [Person1]:  I'm filthy rich!

[Person2]:  I'm getting by OK. I heard MicroPower was going to make Zina president of their new InfoKing Internet division. 
[Person1]:  I wrote this song last night. I've been feeling very creative lately. [Person2]:  It was interesting. I've never heard a song about bees before. [Person1]:  I was just thinking about these last night and how they buzz around the flowers. I had to pick up my guitar and start composing. [Person2]:  I bet you have a lot of other songs. [Person1]:  Oh yeah, I wrote one about the ocean the other day. And I have others about socks, my mom, picking apples and tons of other things. I think I'm going to put them all on an album. [Person2]:  Good idea. [Person1]:  Maybe I will get really famous and go on tour. Want to be in my band? [Person2]:  Well, my style is really different from yours. Your songs are so happy and light. [Person1]:  I have some sad songs, too. We would make a really good team I think. Come over to my place later and let's see how we sound together.
[Person1]:  Hey, sorry. The meeting ran late. What is this? [Person2]:  Someone in the club gave me this. It's an invitation from a tennis club in Sweden. [Person1]:  Sweden? Why did he give it to you? [Person2]:  He wants me to join. A lot of people who joined ended up becoming professional tennis players. [Person1]:  Oh, that's amazing. You have to do it. [Person2]:  But I don't want to go. [Person1]:  Why? [Person2]:  Because I have promised my uncle I would help him at his company. [Person1]:  But this is a good opportunity. I think your uncle can find someone else to help him. [Person2]:  I'm not interested in playing professionally. I'd rather be working on my uncles company and saving money for college.
[Person1]:  Can I help you? [Person2]:  Yes, I would like to buy a Walkman. Can you tell me about the models you have? [Person1]:  Well, we have a lot of models here.

This Kreng portable cassette player is very good. [Person2]:  Kreng? I've never heard of that company. [Person1]:  It's a German company. This unit has auto-reverse, recording capability, and an AM / FM radio band. It also has a built-in microphone. [Person2]:  I suppose I don't want that one then. I don't like auto-reverse. It breaks too easily. [Person1]:  Really? Have you had an auto-reverse break before? [Person2]:  Yes, twice now. I think it's too high-tech, and so it's the first part that breaks. [Person1]:  Hmm. You know, the problem might be dust. Did you clean the unit often? [Person2]:  Well. No, I didn't clean it. But still, I only had the last one two months, and it broke. I don't trust auto-reverse. [Person1]:  Alright. Well. We have many units without auto-reverse. Here is a good unit. Very reliable. It has an AM / FM band, built-in microphone, recording capability, and no auto-reverse. [Person2]:  How much is it? [Person1]:  This one sells for $ 39. 99. [Person2]:  Can I test it out? [Person1]:  Of course. [Person2]:  It sounds great. I'll take it. [Person1]:  Fine. I think you'll be happy with it. It's a very good unit. Very reliable. I'll go get you a new one in a box. I will be back in just a moment. [Person2]:  Thanks.
[Person1]:  It is quite important to be a good listener in the interview. [Person2]:  Listening carefully can show you understand and respect the speaker. [Person1]:  It can show your good attainment as well. [Person2]:  Besides, you can pick up some helpful information from the talk. [Person1]:  First of all, you should keep proper posture and make eye contact with the speaker with a smile.

[Person2]:  Never should you interrupt on a unfamiliar topic. [Person1]:  Sure, in order not to leave a bad impression on the interviewer. [Person2]:  Additionally, don't show any impatience to a repeated topic. [Person1]:  Don't be absent-minded even when you are not interested in the talk.

[Person2]:  I'm quite sure. I've always loved working with children.

[Person1]:  Hello, Vicki. [Person2]:  Hi, David. What a beautiful necklace! Dude, I'Ve never seen anything like it. [Person1]:  Well, you can have it for eleven hundred, as a friend. [Person2]:  I think seven hundred is enough. [Person1]:  What? Seven hundred? [Person2]:  Well, eight hundred, then? [Person1]:  No, one thousand at least. [Person2]:  Eight hundred and fifty. Come on. I have 4 kids, 3 dogs, and 2 husbands to feed! [Person1]:  You're a thief, Vicki. But I guess, eight hundred and fifty is all right. [Person2]:  Here you are, sucker! [Person1]:  Victory for me, I bought it for 30 bucks just yesterday!

[Person1]:  Hello. This is Hamilton's Heating and cooling service. Can I help you? [Person2]:  Yes. My home freezer is not working properly. [Person1]:  What's the problem? [Person2]:  It keeps running all the time, never stopping. And it makes a strange sound. All the ice cream inside it melted. [Person1]:  Maybe the compressor is going bad. [Person2]:  Can you send the technician to check it out? [Person1]:  Sure. But there is a minimum charge of $ 60 for a service visit. If your freezer needs parts, there will be an additional charge. [Person2]:  Okay. I'll pay the charges. [Person1]:  All right. let me check our technician's schedules. I'll call you back and let you know what time we can send a service technician to your house.

[Person1]:  Now, David, what do you like best about being a football star? [Person2]:  Well, I love to hear the cheering when I'm playing, especially when I score a goal. And, of course, the pay is good. But you know, the most important thing in football is teamwork. So I must thank all my teammates. [Person1]:  Can you tell us something about your training? [Person2]:  Well, we train very hard, especially before a big game. The team has to stay together on the road-sometimes for weeks-and I find it very boring. [Person1]:  Do you get nervous? [Person2]:  Before the game, yes, but not during it. [Person1]:  Are you worried about tomorrow's game? [Person2]:  No. Even if we lose we'll probably still get the cup. You see, we scored more goals than Northern City, so they'll have to win by at least four goals if they want the cup. I don't think they can do it. [Person1]:  Thank you and good luck tomorrow.

All buses have fridges for cold drinks, disco-quality sound, an amazing light show and comfortable leather seats. What we don't have is cooking equipment. All buses also have a bus host, whose job is to make sure all the guests get back on the bus after each stop. [Person1]:  After each stop? So guests don't spend the whole evening driving around on the bus? [Person2]:  No! In fact, we take them to 4 different clubs during the evening. At each club, we've booked special VIP entrance, which means no waiting to get in, and everyone gets a free drink. [Person1]:  Anything else our listeners should know about the parties? [Person2]:  Yes, all guests must be smartly dressed. No jeans or sports shoes. The only exception would be if they want to have a fancy-dress party. And we need to know the time you book if you are planning a fancy-dress party. Clubs like to know in advance when parties will be arriving. [Person1]:  Thanks, Dennis.
[Person1]:  So, how was your vacation? You went to Paris, didn't you? [Person2]:  Yeah, with my parents. We just got back on Saturday. It was wonderful! [Person1]:  What sights did you visit? [Person2]:  Well, we saw all the most famous places, the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame Cathedral... They were so interesting. [Person1]:  Did you take any tours? [Person2]:  Just one - a boat tour on the Seine River. [Person1]:  Wow! That sounds fantastic. [Person2]:  Yeah. It was a great way to see the city. [Person1]:  Did you go to any of the famous art museums? [Person2]:  Yeah. My parents love art, so they spent hours in the museums. But for me, it was pretty boring. I'm just not very interested in paintings. [Person1]:  So, what else did you do? [Person2]:  Well, I guess my favorite thing to do was just to sit in cafes and watch the people. It was really relaxing, and French coffee is terrific. [Person1]:  It sounds like a great vacation to me. But I have work at hand. Hopefully I'll be there one day.
[Person1]:  Tom, I rang you yesterday, but you were out. [Person2]:  I'm sorry, Mary. But I came home quite late yesterday about half past nine in the evening. Jim and Betty invited me to go for a picnic. [Person1]:  Oh, how lovely, Tom! And did you like the picnic? [Person2]:  Yes, I liked it very much. [Person1]:  When did you leave, Tom? [Person2]:  Jim and Betty came in their car about ten o'clock in the morning, and we left soon afterwards. [Person1]:  And where did you go for the picnic? [Person2]:  We went to National Park. [Person1]:  Oh, it's lovely in National Park at this time of the year. [Person2]:  Yes, and the sun shone all day. [Person1]:  There's a river in National Park; did you have your lunch near the river? [Person2]:  Yes, we had lunch near the river. Then, after lunch, we went for a walk along the river. Then we climbed up to the top of a hill, and looked at the beautiful view. [Person1]:  What did you do then, Tom? [Person2]:  Well, we went back to the car, and we drove to another part of National Park, and we had afternoon tea there. Then we started to drive home. [Person1]:  Oh, you left early! [Person2]:  Yes, Mary. But it took a long time to reach home because there was a lot of traffic on the road. [Person1]:  Well, that was a lovely day's outing. [Person2]:  Yes, I had a very good time.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, did you see a set of keys?  [Person2]:  What kind of keys?  [Person1]:  Five keys and a small FooWa ornament.  [Person2]:  What a shame! I didn't see them.  [Person1]:  Well, can you help me look for it? That's my first time here.  [Person2]:  Sure. It's my pleasure. I'd like to help you look for the missing keys.  [Person1]:  It's very kind of you.  [Person2]:  It's not a big deal. Hey, I found them.  [Person1]:  Oh, thank God! I don't know how to thank you, guys.  [Person2]:  You're welcome. 
[Person1]:  Hi, Asha, is your mother feeling any better? [Person2]:  No, I'm afraid not. She's very homesick. She misses her family and friends back in India. [Person1]:  Do you think she will ever move back to India? [Person2]:  I'm not sure. It's very difficult for her, because my father and my sisters all live here in Florida. So she doesn't want to leave us. [Person1]:  Does she ever go to visit her family in India? [Person2]:  She goes back once a year to visit her family and old friends. But, when she's in India, she misses her family in the United States. [Person1]:  It must be very hard for her to always be torn between 2 places. [Person2]:  Yes, it is. And she's always telling us not to forget our Indian culture. So next year, my sisters and I are planning on traveling to India with her for a few months, so that we can all experience the culture together. [Person1]:  I think that's a wonderful idea. She'll be so happy.
[Person1]:  Hello, everyone. On tonight's program, we have Janet Stott from a travel agency, who's going to talk about visiting the UK. Welcome to the program, Janet. First, telephones. Most people will probably want to phone home sometime during their stay in the UK. [Person2]:  Well, there aren't many red phone boxes left these days. Nowadays, some phone boxes in big cities are like mini Internet cafes, you can phone or e-mail from them. Here is a good tip, phone after 6 [Person1]:  Really? OK, now on to hotels. Hotels are expensive in Britain, aren't they? [Person2]:  Yes, they are. But you can always find a cheaper youth hostel. Look for hostels with a YHA sign they're usually clean and comfortable. [Person1]:  That's true.
[Person1]:  Professor Jones, you're a well-known professor of mathematics at the City College. May I ask you a few questions about your favorite hobby? [Person2]:  Sure, I like collecting coins the most. [Person1]:  How long have you been collecting coins? [Person2]:  Since I was 12 years old when my uncle gave me a book with spaces to put coins into. [Person1]:  How did your interest grow? [Person2]:  I finished that book one year later and continued to search for rare and old ones. [Person1]:  Where do you find your coins? [Person2]:  Sometimes I get them from a small shops but I usually buy them from other People who collect coins. [Person1]:  You seem very proud of your hobby. [Person2]:  Of course, I often show my friends the coins I collect, it's a lot of fun I think. [Person1]:  Thank you for your time, professor Jones. I think People will like reading about your hobby.
[Person1]:  Hello, Mr. Thomas. Could you spare a minute? [Person2]:  What do you need? [Person1]:  I need to talk to you about that new driver you ' Ve hired. I think I am going to have some problems working with him. [Person2]:  He seems to be quite qualified. If it is a personal problem I preferred if you would work out between yourselves.
[Person1]:  How are those jeans? [Person2]:  They fit me well and I like the style, but I find them a little bit too long. [Person1]:  What if you roll them up a little? [Person2]:  I guess I could, but then they would look different. [Person1]:  I see, we can make them shorter for you if you want. [Person2]:  Yeah, that would be great. [Person1]:  Sure thing, though it will take about 2 hours. You can pay for them first and come back in the afternoon or evening to pick them up. [Person2]:  That's fine. Can I pick them up tomorrow? [Person1]:  No problem.
[Person1]:  Do you think what I did to Elvin was out of line? [Person2]:  You could have tried to explain to him about the new programmers. [Person1]:  Elvin doesn't want any programming help. He wants all the glory for himself. [Person2]:  You might be right. He does think pretty highly of himself. [Person1]:  Did you hear the names he was calling me? [Person2]:  I heard. But did you have to tear out his nose ring?
[Person1]:  Next please! Hello sir, may I see your passport please? [Person2]:  Yes, here you go. [Person1]:  Will you be checking any bags today. [Person2]:  Yes, I'd like to check three pieces. [Person1]:  I'm sorry, sir. Airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage, at twenty kilograms each, plus one piece of carry-on luggage. I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase. [Person2]:  What? Why! I am taking an intercontinental flight! I'm flying sixteen thousand CMS! How am I supposed to only take two, twenty kilo bags? That's absurd! [Person1]:  I am sorry, sir, there's nothing I can do. You cannot board the flight with that large bag either. Carry - on bags must fit in the over-head compartment or under your seat. That bag is clearly too big. [Person2]:  Now I see. You charge next to nothing for an international ticket, but when it comes to charging for any other small thing, you charge an arm and a leg! So tell me, miss, how much will I have to pay for all of this. [Person1]:  Let's see. . . six hundred and twenty-five US dollars. [Person2]:  That's more than my round-trip ticket!
[Person1]:  Honey, wait! I've sprained my ankle. [Person2]:  Oh, my god, are you OK? [Person1]:  Of course not! [Person2]:  Come on, sit down, and let me have a look. [Person1]:  The pain is killing me. [Person2]:  I told you to wear running shoes. But you don't listen. [Person1]:  I thought leather shoes will do just as well. [Person2]:  Hold on, don't move, I will take care of that. [Person1]:  What are you going to do? [Person2]:  I will get some ice, and put it on your ankle. How does that feel? [Person1]:  God! It's freezing! [Person2]:  Be brave. Don't worry. You will be able to walk soon.
[Person1]:  Hello, I want to know how much it costs to have a manicure and pedicure. [Person2]:  Usually it's 60 dollars for a manicure, and 80 dollars for a pedicure. But with this special discount, the total for both is only one hundred and 20 dollars, and you can get them painted. [Person1]:  That's nice. I'd like to give it a try. I think I like passion red. please. [Person2]:  Alright.Do you want your cuticles cut, too? [Person1]:  No. [Person2]:  Would you like the shapes square or round? [Person1]:  Square. But with round at the edges, please. [Person2]:  All right, it's done. Please follow me to the drying section. [Person1]:  How long will it take to get them dry? [Person2]:  Ten or about five minutes. You'll be all set. [Person1]:  I see, thank you.
[Person1]:  How have you been? [Person2]:  Fine, thank you. [Person1]:  And how's everyone in your family? [Person2]:  Very well, thank you. I'm meeting my wife and daughter for lunch at 12 [Person1]:  I'd love to but I'm afraid I can't. I'Ve already got a lunch engagement.
[Person1]:  Well, Betty. Since you'Ve done well during the probation period, we decided to employ you formally. And now we need to sign the formal agreement. [Person2]:  Thank you very much, Mr. Smith. I am very happy that I'll be a member of your team. May I see the agreement first? [Person1]:  Of course. If you have any questions, just bring them out. [Person2]:  OK, thank you. Well, I find that the salary level in this agreement is not like what you have said in the interview. Can you give me some explanations? [Person1]:  Well, it's like this, during your first year, you will enjoy this salary level, a year later, we'll increase your salary by 20 %. [Person2]:  Can we add up this item to the agreement? [Person1]:  Yes, maybe the personnel department made some mistakes in making the agreement. Do you have any other questions? [Person2]:  No, thank you. Shall we sign the agreement now? [Person1]:  Yes, welcome to our company. I hope we can cooperate happily. [Person2]:  Thank you. I'll work hard.
[Person1]:  I enjoy the folk song and dance show very much. [Person2]:  I'm glad you appreciate our folk music. But a live performance is much more interesting. [Person1]:  I can't wait anymore. When does the performance start? [Person2]:  The show starts at 7 and is over at around 10 o'clock p. m. [Person1]:  ( After the show ) It's an excellent musical. The acting was very expressive and the songs and dancing were superb. [Person2]:  I'm glad you enjoyed it. It's had long run, but the house has always been full. [Person1]:  What do you think of the leading actors? [Person2]:  Personally I liked the main character. He was true to type. [Person1]:  You are a better judge. I don't know the play well enough.
[Person1]:  Wow, that terrible movie is finally over. Next time I'm picking the film, because I don't want to end up seeing a chick flick. [Person2]:  Well you should have picked, in the end you always complain about everything. [Person1]:  Not everything, just this film. Even the title is ridiculous. and it's so long, those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life, so much so that I'm thinking about asking them to give me my money back. [Person2]:  I'm thinking of taking you back home. I thought we could have a nice evening, but you're always so negative. [Person1]:  I'm only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage. [Person2]:  You see, that's what I'm talking about, I can't stand your sarcastic jokes anymore [Person1]:  Next time, go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings. [Person2]:  Well he's more of a man than you are ; at least he appreciates love stories. [Person1]:  Love stories? More like one-night-stands. [Person2]:  Don't criticize Mario or else I'll start on those fat, drunk friends of yours ; they're no saints. [Person1]:  My friends? Fat? What about those whales you call friends? [Person2]:  You're unbearable ; you can walk home, I'm leaving.
[Person1]:  Hello. How can we be of service? [Person2]:  I'm here to see about a Fixed Asset Loan. [Person1]:  OK, are you already an account holder? [Person2]:  Yes, I am. But I'm not sure if I'm eligible. [Person1]:  To find out if you are eligible for our Fixed Asset Loan, we will have to look at various aspects of your business, such as your long-term business prospects, your cash flow, your profitability, your capital structure. . . [Person2]:  For my credit worthiness? [Person1]:  Yes, and then other qualitative factors, such as the transparency of your business operations, your credibility and the integrity of your management.
[Person1]:  What do you plan to order? [Person2]:  I think I'll just have a salad and a cup of tea. [Person1]:  Is that all? [Person2]:  Yes, I'm on a diet, my doctor told me that I should lose some weight because I'm too heavy--and that's not healthy. [Person1]:  How do you feel? [Person2]:  I feel fine, in fact, I've never felt better. Besides, some of my old clothes would fit me if I lost about 40 pounds. [Person1]:  How long will that take you? [Person2]:  Well, I've just started my diet, so it may take me 6 months to get down to my proper weight. [Person1]:  Do you plan to eat nothing but salads for 6 months? [Person2]:  No, I'll be able to eat fruit and certain meats and milk products, but most important, I should never eat anything between meals and I should not eat anything containing sugar. [Person1]:  Then you probably won't want to try the delicious cookies they serve here. [Person2]:  Now that you mention it, I may have 2 or 3, I usually have 5 or 6.
[Person1]:  Doctor, save my baby, please [Person2]:  What symptoms does he have? [Person1]:  He has had a fever for one day. Just now at home, he had febrile convulsions with teeth and fists clenched and eyes turned up. We were at a loss what to do. We called an ambulance and brought the baby here. [Person2]:  How long did the convulsion last? [Person1]:  About 3 minutes. [Person2]:  Does he have any other complaints? [Person1]:  Three days ago, he began to cough, sneeze and have a running nose. Yesterday, he began to have a fever. [Person2]:  Have you taken his temperature? [Person1]:  It was 38 C this morning and it was 39 C just now. [Person2]:  Let me examine him to see if there is any rash. No rash. [Person1]:  Is it serious? Is it meningitis? [Person2]:  No, it is not meningitis. Just a high fever and convulsions, which results from a virus upper respiratory tract inflection. [Person1]:  Does he have to be admitted to hospital? [Person2]:  No. No need for admission. I'll give the baby analgia nose drops to bring down the temperature first. Then I will give you a prescription. The pink tablets are used for his fever. When his temperature is over 38  C, give him one tablet. The other tablets are sedatives for his convulsions. The white liquid is for the cold. Give the baby plenty of water to drink. [Person1]:  Thank you very much, doctor.
[Person1]:  Are there any long rivers in Africa? [Person2]:  Yes, for example, the River Nile is the longest fiver in the world. [Person1]:  Is it Egypt? I hear that it used to flood large areas. What about it today? [Person2]:  In order to control the flood and make electricity, people built the Aswan High Dam on the river. [Person1]:  Then it is another interesting place, isn't it?
[Person1]:  Peter, people around the world come to America to live, work and study, so to understand America in terms of its cultural differences is very important. [Person2]:  I couldn't agree with you more, Jack. Americans are much more assertive than most foreigners. For example, Americans begin a discussion with a focus on accomplishments and concrete facts. [Person1]:  You're right. America is a rather individualistic society, with less social pressure to conform. So you will need to become more assertive and to speak out on your own behalf. [Person2]:  Another aspect of American behavior is Americans are more guarded about personal space. So when you are talking to an American, don't stay too close. This personal distance is not due to body odor or bad breath, but because closeness lends a sense of intimacy that is out of proportion to the relationship at the moment. [Person1]:  Yes. Also, try to avoid physical contact while you are speaking. Touching is a bit too intimate for casual acquaintances. So don't put your arm around their shoulder, touch their face, or hold their hand. Shaking hands when you initially meet or part is acceptable, but this is only momentary. [Person2]:  In many cultures, eye contact is a sign of disrespect, which is not the ease in America. In fact, it is an indication of openness, honesty, and enthusiasm.
[Person1]:  I need to order new business cards.  [Person2]:  Do you have any idea how many you'd like?  [Person1]:  I think 2, 000 would be enough.  [Person2]:  Would you fill out this form, please?  [Person1]:  I don't want to make any changes to my old card.  [Person2]:  If you detect any difference, I'll take you out to dinner.  [Person1]:  . . . Okay, that's it. Here's the form, and here's my old card to use as a model.  [Person2]:  Thank you. Your order will be ready seven days from now.  [Person1]:  I need it sooner. Let me have it in three days, okay?  [Person2]:  We can certainly give you faster turn around, but it will cost you extra. 
[Person1]:  There's a big sale on clothes and sporting goods at Riverside Mall.  [Person2]:  Sporting goods? Is that bike Tim wanted on sale?  [Person1]:  Yeah, it's 30 percent off the regular price.  [Person2]:  Well, maybe we could get it now and hide it until his birthday.  [Person1]:  Yeah, it's a couple weeks away, and we don't have anything yet.  [Person2]:  Don't buy him underwear again. He hates that.  [Person1]:  I know, I know, but if I didn't buy it for him, he'd never buy it.  [Person2]:  See anything else we need there?  [Person1]:  Well, all shoes are 20 percent off.  [Person2]:  Shoes? You already have a closet full of shoes.  [Person1]:  I know, but another pair can't hurt.  [Person2]:  Oh, all right. I need some new shirts, too. Let's go after breakfast. 
[Person1]:  Okay, can I ask you something direct?  [Person2]:  Ha! It's not like you've ever been one to beat around the bush.  [Person1]:  Fair enough. Give it to me straight. Did she bully you into this?  [Person2]:  No, seriously . . . I really want this.  [Person1]:  I tell ya, when I got the invite, it really threw me for a loop. You've done a complete 180.  [Person2]:  I know. But things have changed. I guess I've settled down.  [Person1]:  I guess so. 
[Person1]:  Hello Michael.  [Person2]:  Hello Todd.  [Person1]:  We're going to talk about Australia. Or your going to talk about Australia. So first of all how any people live in Australia?  [Person2]:  Australia? Oh, there's about twenty million people in Australia right now. A little bit under, but close to twenty.  [Person1]:  OK. What are the biggest cities?  [Person2]:  The biggest city? The biggest city is Sydney, then it's followed by Melbourne and then Brisbane and then I think it's Perth. But most of the big cities are on the East Coast of Australia. And Perth is on the west coast, but sort of of out there by itself.  [Person1]:  OK. Um, if you had to live in one place where would you live?  [Person2]:  I like Brisbane. I had my teenage years in Brisbane, growing up in Brisbane, um or maybe Sidney because it is a big city, but Brisbane has got the gold coast and the sunshine.  [Person1]:  Oh, nice. Actually, what is the capital city of Australia?  [Person2]:  Ah, Canberra is the capital city. But is not the biggest city. Sydney is the biggest city. Canberra was made sort of by the politicians so Sydney wouldn't get to crowded. It's a separate territory. 
[Person1]:  Sir, would you like some dessert now?  [Person2]:  Please show me the menu again.  [Person1]:  Here you are. sir, the chocolate cake is very delicious.  [Person2]:  No, thanks. I don't like chocolate. I'd like strawberry pie.  [Person1]:  I am afraid there is none.  [Person2]:  Then I'll have vanilla ice cream.  [Person1]:  Fine. I will bring it right away. 
[Person1]:  Lucy, I ' d like to fix the light in the corridor, it keeps flashing, which drives me crazy. Would you like to help me with the ladder? [Person2]:  Monica, wait a moment. I think we ' d better call the repair man to do it. [Person1]:  I think I can handle it by myself. [Person2]:  I ' d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company. [Person1]:  I see. If I got hurt when fixing the light, even during office hours, I wouldn ' t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility. [Person2]:  Other company rules also need your attention. [Person1]:  Like this one? Never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder. Yeah, thank you for telling me. [Person2]:  Don ' t mention it.
[Person1]:  Hi, Bob. What time is it now? [Person2]:  Uh, you are wearing a watch, Julia. [Person1]:  My watch is never correct. [Person2]:  It's six. I always have the correct time on my mobile phone. [Person1]:  Although mobile phones aren't as convenient as watches, at least you always know the correct time. [Person2]:  Yes, I think you should have your watch repaired. Otherwise, it's just a decoration around your wrist. [Person1]:  Well, I'm considering getting a new one. By the way, Robin invited me for dinner at 7 [Person2]:  Go down the street and turn right at the second crossroads. You will find it near Starbucks across from the bank. [Person1]:  Thanks a lot.
[Person1]:  I want to see the man responsible for selling typewriters. [Person2]:  My name is Steven. I'm the Sales Manager of this company. [Person1]:  Well, look here. Ten new typewriters were delivered to my company yesterday afternoon and only five of them work properly. [Person2]:  Oh, I'm sorry about that. [Person1]:  Never mind being sorry, what are you going to do about it? [Person2]:  Don't worry, we'll soon fix them. [Person1]:  Good, I hope you'll make sure that it won't happen again. [Person2]:  I'll certainly look into that. [Person1]:  Thank you. Goodbye.
[Person1]:  Did you get Bean's ten different good luck forwards, like that one from the Dalai Lama? [Person2]:  Yeah, I deleted all that superstitious crap. What a waste of bandwidth! [Person1]:  I figured I might as well send one or two of them out. Maybe my luck will get better. [Person2]:  Do you really think the Dalai Lama sent that? I'm tired of all these forwards. [Person1]:  It's worth a shot. Maybe we'll get some luck in thinking up something for this case.
[Person1]:  I'm going to the fair now. if any one looks for me. ask them to call the fair. [Person2]:  What is the telephone number there? [Person1]:  8826789 4, extension to 208 [Person2]:  When will you reach there? [Person1]:  About ten. another thing is that I want an appointment with the customer at Changing hotel at three thirty this afternoon. please help me phone the customer so we can confirm now. [Person2]:  What is the customer's name, and what is his room number? [Person1]:  You can check them from the fax yesterday. [Person2]:  Ok, I'll phone the customer right away. Do you want to pick him up at our office? [Person1]:  No, I'll discuss the business with him at hotel.
[Person1]:  Hi, Becky, what's up? [Person2]:  Not much, except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall. [Person1]:  What's the problem? [Person2]:  She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do. I can never do anything right when she ' s around. [Person1]:  For example? [Person2]:  Well, last week I invited her over to dinner. My husband and I had no problem with the food, but if you listened to her, then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables. There's just nothing can please her. [Person1]:  No, I can't see that happening. I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen. [Person2]:  It's not just that. She also criticizes how we raise the kids. [Person1]:  My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us. If it wasn't disciplining them enough, then we were disciplining them too much. She also complained about the food we fed them, the schools we sent them too, and everything else under the sun.
[Person1]:  Actually, I was wondering what we should do if either one of us would like to terminate the contract? [Person2]:  Well, as a rule, the contract will become void automatically, if both sides do not agree to renew it when time comes. [Person1]:  I got it, but nevertheless. what I was saying just now was that how to terminate the contract before its term's up? [Person2]:  Oh, I am sorry. I misunderstood. Well, in that case, the contract can be canceled with a 2 month's notice. What do you say? [Person1]:  That sounds perfect for us.
[Person1]:  Jack I hear you have a chance to go to college without taking a test. Is that right? [Person2]:  The news goes so fast. Ah, yes, I haven't decided yet. [Person1]:  Don't hesitate. That's a very famous university which a lot of students are longing to attain. [Person2]:  Maybe you are right. But the major is not fit for me. I like architecture more than computers. [Person1]:  But this chance is really precious. [Person2]:  Well, I know. So I am thinking now. [Person1]:  I hope you can make a clever choice. Anyway, the opportunities around you are not that By. [Person2]:  Thank you for your kindness. I will think about it carefully.
[Person1]:  what kinds of tv programmes do you enjoy watching? [Person2]:  I like current affairs programmes and documentaries, especially wildlife ones. How about you? [Person1]:  I like those kinds of programmes too. They're very informative. I think that many people underrate the education value of tv. [Person2]:  I agree. People often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence. [Person1]:  yeah. And that's so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational! [Person2]:  right. You can't blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programmes. They need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programmes. [Person1]:  in my country, there's a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown. I think it's about six minutes per hour. [Person2]:  that's great idea. But don't the tv station lose a lot of money because of that? [Person1]:  no. they don't. they simply charge higher prices at peak times. Is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country? [Person2]:  not as far as I know. We have so many advertisements. the interruptions are unbearable sometimes! That's one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv, where you pay a fixed amount each mo [Person1]:  some people have satellite and cable tv in my country, but people don't seem to keen to pay for their tv programmes. Besides, the terrestrial channels offer a good range of programmes. [Person2]:  well, there's a wildlife documentary on tv in a few minutes. Shall we?
[Person1]:  Do you take a bus to and from work? [Person2]:  Yeah, everyday. And there ' s only one choice. All the other buses are going the other direction. [Person1]:  Hmm. I have the same problem. When I leave work, it ' s always rush hour. So the buses are always crowded. [Person2]:  Oh, yeah, it ' s terrible. I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China. It ' s when so many people try to get onto one city bus, and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt. [Person1]:  That sounds terrible the way you describe it. But you know, not long ago I really suffered on the bus. [Person2]:  What happened? Were you having a hard time getting on a bus? [Person1]:  You just can ' t imagine! I waited for the first bus but it was too full, so I waited for the second, and it was still very crowded. Then I decided not to wait for the next one, and got on the second bus. It was so full that I had to stand on one foot! No kidding! [Person2]:  Hmm. Good exercise, uh? [Person1]:  Yeah, absolutely! [Person2]:  And it ' s so much fun. One day, the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl ' s behind was pressed against my front. I was afraid to put my hands down for fear of accidentally groping her. [Person1]:  You were so happy, weren ' t you? [Person2]:  What do you think? I ' m a good boy.
[Person1]:  What did you say? [Person2]:  I said it's a lovely day. Why don't we go for a walk? [Person1]:  Well, I feel a little tired. [Person2]:  Come on! A little labor, much health. [Person1]:  Then can you wait a few minutes? I want to finish writing this letter. [Person2]:  Don't take too long. It would be a shame not to take advantage of such lovely weather. [Person1]:  I won't be long. No more than ten minutes. Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you in the park? [Person2]:  Believe I will. Look for me near the lake.
[Person1]:  Hello, I hope to get a room for the night. [Person2]:  Do you have a reservation? [Person1]:  Sorry, I don't. [Person2]:  Let me see if I can fit you in. What kind of room do you want? [Person1]:  I only need a single room. [Person2]:  Smoking or non-smoking? [Person1]:  Smoking if possible. [Person2]:  You are in luck, we have one free. [Person1]:  I am very grateful. How much will it be? [Person2]:  That will be 600 RIB. Could I have your credit card please? [Person1]:  Oh dear. I don't have it with me. Do you take debit cards or should I pay with cash? [Person2]:  A debit card will be fine.
[Person1]:  How did you meet Bill? [Person2]:  I met him through a computer bulletin board on the network. [Person1]:  Oh, really? Which bulletin board? [Person2]:  It was the one I used down at the local coffee house called the San Francisco Net. It has been around since 2016. [Person1]:  I've heard about that, but I've never tried it. [Person2]:  You ought to. Fifty cents buys you an hour of computer time. A 'Chat Session' links you with people in other cafs. We can make new friends by that means. [Person1]:  But I don't like to talk on the network with strangers. [Person2]:  You can do that. A private room lets you talk alone. [Person1]:  OK. I'll try it.
[Person1]:  Where is the report I asked you to finish for today, Daug? [Person2]:  I'm really sorry, Ms. Jameson but it's not quite ready. I will have it by tomorrow. [Person1]:  That will be too late, Daug, it is needed at the board meeting this afternoon. You have been working on it for three weeks now. Why can't you have your work done on time? [Person2]:  I've just had a lot of other things to do. And I still haven't caught up with the work I missed while I was on vacation. [Person1]:  Well, I am really tired of your excuses, Daug. Your work has been getting worse for the past several months. I have said a few things about it in the past, but nothing seems to help. [Person2]:  I am really sorry. I know I am not working up to my abilities. You will see a real improvement in my work from now on. Ms. Jameson. I can promise you that. [Person1]:  I certainly hope so. I know you are able to do much better than you have shown in the last few months.
[Person1]:  Tom must be joking when he said he plans to sell his shop and go to medical school. [Person2]:  You are quite right. He is just kidding. He's also told me time and time again he wished he'd studied for some profession instead of going into business.
[Person1]:  How do you feel about flying? [Person2]:  I don't mind flying. What I don't like is not being able to keep an eye on my luggage. Whenever the man at the airport hakes my luggage, I never expect to see again. [Person1]:  There is always a chance it will fly to Paris while you fly to Rome. Has anything like that ever happened to you? [Person2]:  No, but it has happened to other people. Just the other day. I heard about a Japanese woman who lost her suitcase. It was a true story. She was on one of those five-day tours around Europe. [Person1]:  Where did her suitcase get lost? [Person2]:  I don't think she ever find out. When she arrived in Europe, her suitcase wasn't there. She had to travel through four countries in the same clothes. [Person1]:  I suppose she bought another toothbrush at least. Couldn't she buy another dress? [Person2]:  No, she had spent all her money on the tickets for the tour. Besides, she never had time to shop. Every time they reached another airport, she had spent her time in the luggage room looking for her suitcase. [Person1]:  What a way to spend the vacation!
[Person1]:  Have you had enough time to look over the menu?  [Person2]:  Yes, we are almost ready to order.  [Person1]:  Let me remind you of the specials of the day, which are posted on the board.  [Person2]:  Oh, that all sounds so good! Can we get the sauce on the side?  [Person1]:  Yes, we would be happy to prepare the food to meet your special needs.  [Person2]:  I was wondering if you have any vegetarian choices.  [Person1]:  Yes, the roasted vegetable salad is good, and the portabella mushroom burger is also a good choice.  [Person2]:  I think that I would like to order the broccoli noodles, please.  [Person1]:  That is an excellent choice, and I could bring you your salads now or bring them with your dinner.  [Person2]:  Please bring our salads to us now. We are hungry! 
[Person1]:  I'm tired of watching television. Let's go to cinema to- night. [Person2]:  All right. Do you want to go downtown? Or is there a good movie in the neighborhood? [Person1]:  I'd rather not spend a lot of money. What does the pa- per say about neighborhood theaters? [Person2]:  Here's the list on page... Column 6. Here it is. Where's the Rialto? There's a perfect movie there. [Person1]:  That's too far away. And it's hard to find a place to park there. [Person2]:  Well, the Grand Theater has Gone with the wind. [Person1]:  I saw that years ago. I couldn't wait to see it again. Moreover, it's too long. We wouldn't get home until midnight. [Person2]:  The Center has a horror film. You wouldn't want to see that? [Person1]:  No, indeed. I wouldn't be able to sleep tonight. [Person2]:  That's about ell there is. Unless we change our decision and go downtown. [Person1]:  No, we just can't pay for it. There must be something else we haven't seen. [Person2]:  Here, look for yourself, I can't find anything else. [Person1]:  Look at this! [Person2]:  What? [Person1]:  In the television timetable, there's a baseball game on television tonight. [Person2]:  I wasn't looking for a TV program. I was looking at the movie ads. [Person1]:  I know, but I just happened to notice it. New York is playing Boston. [Person2]:  That must be good. I wouldn't mind watching that. [Person1]:  OK. Let's stay home. We can go to the cinema Friday.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, but can you tell me the way to the railway station? [Person2]:  Just go straight along this street, turn left at the first crossing and walk straight ahead about 100 meters. You can't miss it. [Person1]:  About how long will it take me to get there? [Person2]:  It's about 20 minutes'walk, I think. [Person1]:  I see. Is there a bus I can take? [Person2]:  Yes, you can take the No. 5 bus over there. Get off at the next stop. [Person1]:  Thank you so much for your help. [Person2]:  It's my pleasure.
[Person1]:  Your tree looks beautiful. Do you decorate it this way every year?  [Person2]:  Yes, it's a family tradition dating back to my childhood. We use the same lights and ornaments, but of course we have a new tree each year. The children made some of these decorations. Here, you can hang this on one of those high branches.  [Person3]:  Well, everything seems to be just about ready. Now all we need is snow.  [Person1]:  Do you exchange the presents in the morning?  [Person2]:  Oh, yes. The kids are too excited to wait. After we clean up the mess--all the empty boxes and the wrapping paper -- we have a big breakfast. Then the kids have the whole day to play with their new toys.  [Person3]:  And we'll have a great turkey dinner at around four o'clock. My brother and his family will be joining us.  [Person1]:  I look forward to meeting them. Well, it's late, so I'll say good night. I'll see you early tomorrow, so I can share your Christmas morning.  [Person3]:  Good night! 
[Person1]:  Have you ever worked as a tour guide?  [Person2]:  I have a little experience. I guided a few foreign tourists around Beijing last year as a part-time job. I showed them to the Great Wall, the Imperial Palace, and the Summer Palace.  [Person1]:  Then you may know that it's hard work.  [Person2]:  Yes, I know. A friend of mine is a guide. He talked with me about his work, but I don't mind working hard.  [Person1]:  Have you applied with any other companies?  [Person2]:  No, this is my first.  [Person1]:  Is there anything you want to ask about?  [Person2]:  I'd like to be an overseas tour guide someday. Would there ever be any chance of that?  [Person1]:  Certainly. There'll be a good chance of that if you work for this company. Not right away, of course, but in a few years, after you learn more about our business, you may go overseas with a tour group. Any questions?  [Person2]:  Yes. When can I get the decision? I hope you can give me a definite answer as soon as possible. If I'd turned down, I ll have to secure a position elsewhere.  [Person1]:  All right, then. We'll get in touch with you within a week. Thank you for coming today, Mr. Sun.  [Person2]:  Thank you. Good-bye.  [Person1]:  Good-bye. 
[Person1]:  Hi, Lily. Do you want to see a cool new product? [Person2]:  Sure, what is it? [Person1]:  Lily, meet Clocky. It is an alarm clock and it has a loud alarm. [Person2]:  Why does it have wheels? [Person1]:  Because it rolls around when the alarm rings. [Person2]:  Why does it roll when it rings? [Person1]:  Because you have to get out of bed and chase Clocky. Then you can't go back to sleep after you turn off your alarm. I set it last night, and Clocky worked great this morning. No more sleeping late for me! [Person2]:  Where did you get Clocky? [Person1]:  At Tickers' Clocks in the mall. It cost about $50. [Person2]:  It's expensive. [Person1]:  Clocky is worth it. It can jump. Watch! [Person2]:  Wow. Clocky really moves fast. [Person1]:  It wants to hide. So it's looking for a place, then you have to find it. [Person2]:  Cool. I should get one for my nephew to help him get up. [Person1]:  Why don't you buy one for yourself? [Person2]:  Well, my mobile phone can wake me up.
[Person1]:  Lisa, you don't look quite right. What's wrong? [Person2]:  I just watched a film. It scared me almost to death. I thought it was going to be a very touching story, but it turned out to be a terribly frightening movie. Do you like watching movies like that? [Person1]:  Yes. Watching movies like that can really help me relax and forget all my worries. [Person2]:  So what's your favorite scary movie? [Person1]:  The sixth Sense. I watched it 6 years ago. I was just 12 years old then. I was really scared. [Person2]:  I guess I should watch it someday.
[Person1]:  I've been thinking about our holiday and I wouldn't mind going to Barcelona or Madrid. [Person2]:  Oh no, not Spain again! That's where we went last year. [Person1]:  Well, have you got any better suggestions? [Person2]:  I was thinking of Paris, or even London might be nice. [Person1]:  I don't fancy London. I'd rather go abroad for our holiday. Let's go to Paris. [Person2]:  Right. Paris, here we come!
[Person1]:  How can I help you today? [Person2]:  I am returning something that I bought yesterday. [Person1]:  What would you like to return? [Person2]:  I'm returning a cellphone. [Person1]:  Was there something wrong with it? [Person2]:  It's defective. [Person1]:  What isn't working on it? [Person2]:  It keeps turning off on it's own. [Person1]:  Alright, do you have the receipt? [Person2]:  I have it right here. [Person1]:  I'm going to take care of this and refund your money. [Person2]:  Thanks for your help.
[Person1]:  I am unsure how to add a class and need help. [Person2]:  I have an opening. Do you have an add sheet for me to sign? [Person1]:  Yes, I have an add sheet. [Person2]:  After I sign it, you must take it to the Admissions and Records Office to add the class. Do you know where that is? [Person1]:  No, I'm not sure. [Person2]:  When you cross the quad, the office is right in front of you. Go inside and follow the signs to the correct line. [Person1]:  Thanks. I understand what to do now. [Person2]:  It should be easy to find. After you add the class, check with me in a few weeks to make sure that you are on my roll sheet. [Person1]:  That sounds good. [Person2]:  Good, just make sure that you do the same thing if you ever need to drop a class. Good luck!
[Person1]:  What is the movie you saw last night? [Person2]:  It is a new film, 'Transformer'. [Person1]:  How do you like it? [Person2]:  I expected too high from that movie, but I was a bit disappointed about it. [Person1]:  But I heard the box office rose up to 15 million in the first week. [Person2]:  Box office can't explain everything. I do not think it is cheerful or well-made. The plot is old and the female character is not pretty. [Person1]:  My sister has given me two tickets for tonight. It is called'The life of Rose', a French movie. [Person2]:  What's it about? [Person1]:  It tells the lifetime of a lady singer from a beggar in the street to a famous singer in the world. It is a kind of tragedy. [Person2]:  I prefer the tragedy. It is moving and makes me ponder about my life. [Person1]:  Let's go. The time is coming. [Person2]:  We can buy the popcorn before entering the cinema.
[Person1]:  would you like to learn to tango Donar? [Person2]:  right now? [Person1]:  i am offering you my services. for your church. what do you say? [Person2]:  i think i'll be a little afraid. [Person1]:  of what? [Person2]:  afraid of making a mistake. [Person1]:  no mistakes in a tango Donar. not like life, simple, that will make the tango so great. if you make a mistake, you'll get all tango done. just tango along. why don't you try? will you try it. [Person2]:  all right. i'll give it a try.
[Person1]:  I was wondering if someone in your office could help me with a question I have about my payment. [Person2]:  I would be happy to answer any questions you might have. [Person1]:  My paycheck seems to be smaller than the one I received last week. [Person2]:  What about income? Did you make any money during that period? [Person1]:  My old employer gave us a couple days of work during that period. [Person2]:  When you filled out your Continued Claim Form, did you show that income? [Person1]:  Of course I wrote down the work that I had done on the Continued Claim Form. [Person2]:  What happens is, when you make money, we take part of your benefits away. [Person1]:  I am not going to show any income from now on then. [Person2]:  I wouldn't do that if I were you. There is a severe penalty if you get caught making false statements.
[Person1]:  Hello, ma'am. Can I help you? [Person2]:  Yes, please. I'd like a gin and tonic. [Person1]:  Sure, ma'am. Here you are. [Person2]:  Thank you. How much is it? [Person1]:  25 yuan. [Person2]:  Here's 30. Keep the change. [Person1]:  Thank you very much, ma'am, but we don't take tips in China.
[Person1]:  Welcome to the company. We are conducting a survey of new employees to find out what influenced them to choose our company. [Person2]:  Honestly, the flexible hours were the main attraction for me. The traditional working day doesn't fit in with me lifestyle ; I love being able to tailor my working hours. [Person1]:  Yes, flextime has definitely been a good change for us. How do you feel about the pay? [Person2]:  At first it is going to be difficult. During the first three months, I'm on probation. So I won't get sales commissions until after that. [Person1]:  But there is a big bonus for employees at the end of the probation period. [Person2]:  Yes, I'm looking forward to that! I just hope my first performance review is favorable. [Person1]:  One thing you can be sure of your manager will be quite fair. If your job performance is up to par, you shouldn't be afraid of a performance review, [Person2]:  Great! Then I suppose I'm looking forward to my first promotion, too.
[Person1]:  Hey, Mark, long time no see. [Person2]:  Julie! It's good to see you again. How have you been? [Person1]:  Great. I just got back from a week's vacation in Thailand. [Person2]:  Really? How was it? [Person1]:  Fantastic! I didn't want to come back. [Person2]:  I hear the beaches in Thailand are beautiful. [Person1]:  They are. And not only that the people are friendly, but also the food is delicious, not to mention cheap. [Person2]:  I do like Thai food. Did you see much of Bangkok? [Person1]:  Not much. I've got enough city life in Beijing. [Person2]:  I know what you mean. I could use a vacation myself. [Person1]:  Hey, wouldn't it be great if we could go to Thailand together sometime? [Person2]:  Yeah, it sure would.
[Person1]:  Mum, I can't find my socks for basketball. Have you seen them? [Person2]:  Let me see. Are they white? [Person1]:  Yes. Where did you see them? [Person2]:  I saw them in the sitting-room just now. You may go and get them. [Person1]:  Oh. Here they are! [Person2]:  You should put your things away. [Person1]:  OK. I will.
[Person1]:  Time to eat! [Person2]:  Oh, I'm starving. Where is Mom? [Person1]:  Mom put me in charge of dinner because she's not feeling well tonight. [Person2]:  But what is it ...and that smell? [Person1]:  It's pizza. I just followed an old family recipe here,and ... [Person2]:  Let me see that ...Oh, you're missing a page! [Person1]:  Oh, uh, well, uh ...well I couldn't find the second page of the recipe. But don't worry, I have plenty of experience around the house. [Person2]:  Let me try it. Oh, you put too much salt in it and it's burnt. [Person1]:  Well, I think we'd better go out for dinner.
[Person1]:  I hear that there is a festival called Duanwu in China. [Person2]:  Yes. It is also called Dragon Boat Festival. [Person1]:  Why are you celebrating this festival? [Person2]:  We celebrate it to commemorate a great patriotic poet of China, Qu Yuan. [Person1]:  What do you do on that day? [Person2]:  We'll have rice dumplings. What's more, there are also dragon boat matches in some places of southern China. [Person1]:  I see.
[Person1]:  The children have been playing in the mountains for a long time. Why haven't they come back? I am really worried about them. [Person2]:  Look at the sky. Black clouds are gathering and strong winds are blowing. It seems a heavy rain will fall soon. [Person1]:  They haven't brought anything to protect themselves. They will be caught in the rain I think. [Person2]:  Don't be worried too much about them. Anyhow, they're old enough now. They ought to be able to take care of themselves. [Person1]:  I'm afraid they will catch a cold if they are caught in the rain. You see it's a little cold now. [Person2]:  Shall we bring some umbrellas or raincoats for them? [Person1]:  How can you find them since we don't know where they are? [Person2]:  Well, we can only stay home and wait for them.
[Person1]:  Hi, Sarah How is everything? [Person2]:  Nothing new here. I was just wondering if you want to go out tonight? [Person1]:  Well, I was thinking about reading a book at home tonight. What exactly have you got in mind? [Person2]:  I thought we could just go for a walk. Maybe down to the bridge. [Person1]:  Sorry, but I worked out in the gym this afternoon. I don't feel like going for a walk tonight. [Person2]:  Oh, then let's go to the cinema. There is a new movie playing in theaters. How about going to see it? [Person1]:  Sounds great. What time does it start? [Person2]:  At 8 [Person1]:  Sorry. But my mother will make chicken and potatoes tonight, which are my favorite. So I'd rather eat at home and then go to the cinema. [Person2]:  OK, so let's meet in front of the cinema 20 minutes before the movie begins. OK? [Person1]:  OK. See you then. [Person2]:  See you then.
[Person1]:  Amanda, could you make a call to the cinema to see if there are still some seats left for the movie this afternoon? [Person2]:  I've already booked tickets online for the 2 [Person1]:  OK. Well, the Smiths want to move our appointment forward by half hour earlier. That means we should be there at 11 [Person2]:  Then we don't have enough time. We'd better get moving. Oh, before I forget, can you remind me to stop by the bookstore on the way back home? I have to order a book there. [Person1]:  OK.
[Person1]:  I wonder what we should have for dinner this evening? [Person2]:  Are you asking me? [Person1]:  Yes, I am. I really don't feel much like cooking but the family must eat. [Person2]:  Well, you know me. I can always eat pizza or Spaghetti. [Person1]:  So I've noticed. You are putting on a little weight, aren't you? [Person2]:  I know, you don't have to remind me. I'm starting a new diet the day after tomorrow. [Person1]:  It's about time.
[Person1]:  Hey, Maris, are you a part-timer? [Person2]:  Part-timer? Is that a new buzzword? [Person1]:  Oh, it's pretty popular among my classmates these days. So are you? [Person2]:  Sure, I have a part-time job as a bartender. [Person1]:  Cool! It must be amazing to work at a bar! [Person2]:  Yeah, but I'm not there for fun. I have to remain professional and if I get distracted, the manager would be pretty upset. [Person1]:  That's true. I'm wondering did you learn anything from the job? [Person2]:  Of course. There's always much to learn. I got to know more about the real world. [Person1]:  You mean you got working experience, right? [Person2]:  Not just working experience. I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life. [Person1]:  It must be very demanding. [Person2]:  Sometimes it is. But after working for a few weeks, it's easy to figure out. [Person1]:  Really? It sounds interesting. [Person2]:  Maybe you can come to the bar one day and I'll show you around. [Person1]:  Great. I'm looking forward to it.
[Person1]:  What can I help you with? [Person2]:  I need to hire you. [Person1]:  What do you need me for? [Person2]:  I need you for my court date. [Person1]:  What kind of case do you have? [Person2]:  I'm being charged with a felony. [Person1]:  I can help you with that. [Person2]:  What is your price? [Person1]:  I charge $ 150 an hour. [Person2]:  I can't afford that. [Person1]:  That's my rate. [Person2]:  That's expensive, but I need you.
[Person1]:  That was a great party. Thanks for staying behind to help me clear up. [Person2]:  It certainly was a great party. It's a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here. [Person1]:  I expected that something might get broken. That doesn't bother me. That spilled drink won't leave a stain, will it? [Person2]:  I doubt it, I'll deal with it right away. Luckily it wasn't a glass of red wine, I'll just get a bowl of water and a cloth. [Person1]:  I'm going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag. [Person2]:  Afterwards, we can do the washing up together. Everything will be finished within an hour. Your friend Keith is really funny. I liked his magic tricks. [Person1]:  Yes, he's very good. . isn't he? He told some funny stories too. [Person2]:  Amanda told some very funny jokes. At the beginning of the party, she was being very serious. [Person1]:  I think that she had a litter too much of the punch. [Person2]:  What did you put in that punch? It tasted great, but was quite strong. [Person1]:  That's my little secret. Did you like the snacks that I prepared? [Person2]:  Very much. The birthday cake was delicious, wasn't it? Emily told me that she and karen made it themselves. [Person1]:  That cake tasted so good! It disappeared within minutes, so I think everyone liked it a lot. How's that stain? [Person2]:  All cleaned up. Are you ready to start on the washing up?
[Person1]:  Who has been here already this morning? [Person2]:  Well, Vince dropped off some sales reports for you. Said you signed a big deal with HomeSupplies. com. [Person1]:  They're small fry. Tonight I'm going to LA to negotiate with Stars. com. That'll be big. [Person2]:  You're right. All the entertainment web sites follow Stars. com. [Person1]:  Who else has been here? [Person2]:  Elvin stopped by to see me. [Person1]:  Elvin? Which one is he?
[Person1]:  Excuse me, I've been waiting here for fifteen minutes. Do you know why the traffic is so heavy? [Person2]:  A lorry overturned on the road and blocked it, so all the traffic was held up. [Person1]:  Oh, what a terrible situation! This traffic is unbearable. [Person2]:  Yeah, traffic was brought to a standstill by the accident. If we had gone early we would miss the traffic. [Person1]:  I agree with you. But now we have to wait. The sky is overcast, and it is very sultry. I fear a thunder storm is brewing. [Person2]:  Don't worry. The traffic jam is said to be over soon. [Person1]:  Yes, I hope so. Thank you for telling me this. [Person2]:  It's my pleasure.
[Person1]:  Are you voting tomorrow? [Person2]:  Of course. What about you? [Person1]:  You know that I am. [Person2]:  Where is your polling place? [Person1]:  It's at the park up the street. [Person2]:  Oh, is that right? [Person1]:  Where's your polling place? [Person2]:  I have no idea. [Person1]:  How come you don't know where it is? [Person2]:  Nothing came in the mail telling me my polling place. [Person1]:  You should check online. [Person2]:  Oh, really? Thanks, I'm going to do that right now.
[Person1]:  Tu Mao, I'm hungry, let's get something to eat. [Person2]:  Me too. Is there a place nearby that we can get something to eat? [Person1]:  There's a Kentucky's not far ahead and there's a McDonald's in down street. [Person2]:  Kentucky's? Is that a chain restaurant? [Person1]:  Don't you know about Kentucky's? [Person2]:  I've heard about it, but never had one. [Person1]:  They sell pieces of fried chicken, you've got to try one this time. [Person2]:  OK. Let's go.
[Person1]:  Peter, where are you going? [Person2]:  I'm going to do some shopping. [Person1]:  Won't you watch TV? [Person2]:  What's on TV tonight? Is there a football match? [Person1]:  The TV station will air the World Cup football match alive at 8 [Person2]:  Really? Who will play? [Person1]:  The Brazilian team versus the American team. Don't miss it. [Person2]:  That's cool. I'll watch it. [Person1]:  Who do you think will win? [Person2]:  There is no doubt that the Brazilian team will win. [Person1]:  I think so.
[Person1]:  Honey, what are you doing? Come and have your breakfast. You don't want to be late for work a second time this week, do you? [Person2]:  Of course I don't. But I can't find my glasses. Have you seen them? [Person1]:  Oh, dear. You're always forgetting where you put them. What did you do just now? [Person2]:  I took a shower just a few minutes ago. [Person1]:  Maybe you left them in the bathroom. [Person2]:  No. I checked there but I didn't find them. [Person1]:  What else did you do? [Person2]:  After the shower, I went to the living room. Oh, I remember I read a magazine there. You know I can't read without my glasses. [Person1]:  Then you must have left them there. Go there quickly, I'm sure you'll find them.
[Person1]:  It's taking you forever to do my hair. [Person2]:  Give me a minute. [Person1]:  You should've been done already. [Person2]:  There you go. [Person1]:  I don't think that you're done. [Person2]:  What's wrong? [Person1]:  My hair looks hideous. [Person2]:  What's so bad about it? [Person1]:  It doesn't look good at all. [Person2]:  Sorry about that. [Person1]:  I really hope that you didn't expect me to pay you for this. [Person2]:  Well, let me talk to my manager, okay?
[Person1]:  Next. Uh, your passport please. [Person2]:  Okay. [Person1]:  Uh, what is the purpose of your visit? [Person2]:  I'm here to attend a teaching convention for the first part of my trip, and then I plan on touring the capital for a few days. [Person1]:  And where will you be staying? [Person2]:  I'll be staying in a room at a hotel downtown for the entire week. [Person1]:  And uh, what do you have in your luggage? [Person2]:  Uh, well, just, just my personal belongings um, ... clothes, a few books, and a CD player. [Person1]:  Okay. Uh, please open your bag. [Person2]:  Sure. [Person1]:  Okay ... Everything's fine. [Person2]:  Great. [Person1]:  Uh, by the way, is this your first visit to the country? [Person2]:  Well, yes and no. Actually, I was born here when my parents were working in the capital many years ago, but this is my first trip back since then. [Person1]:  Well, enjoy your trip. [Person2]:  Thanks.
[Person1]:  Morning, this is TGC. [Person2]:  Good morning. Walter Barry here, calling from London. Could I speak to Mr. Grand, please? [Person1]:  Who's calling, please? [Person2]:  Walter Barry, from London. [Person1]:  What is it about, please? [Person2]:  Well, I understand that your company has a chemical processing plant. My own company, LCP, Liquid Control Products, is a leader in safety from leaks in the field of chemical processing. I would like to speak to Mr. Grand to discuss ways in which we could help TGC protect itself from such problems and save money at the same time. [Person1]:  Yes, I see. Well, Mr. Grand is not available just now. [Person2]:  Can you tell me when I could reach him? [Person1]:  He's very busy for the next few days, then he'll be away in New York. So it's difficult to give you a time. [Person2]:  Could I speak to someone else, perhaps? [Person1]:  Who in particular? [Person2]:  A colleague for example? [Person1]:  You're speaking to his personal assistant. I can deal with calls for Mr. Grand. [Person2]:  Yes, well, could I ring him tomorrow? [Person1]:  No, I'm sorry he won't be free tomorrow. Listen, let me suggest something. You send us details of your products and services, together with references from other companies and then we'll contact you. [Person2]:  Yes, that's very kind of you. I have your address. [Person1]:  Very good, Mr.... [Person2]:  Barry. Walter Barry from LCP in London. [Person1]:  Right, Mr. Barry. We look forward to hearing from you. [Person2]:  Thank you. Goodbye. [Person1]:  Bye.
[Person1]:  It seems you've burned yourself out. [Person2]:  Pardon. I'm afraid I didn't quite catch you. [Person1]:  You look tired. You must have overworked yourself. [Person2]:  Yes, a little bit. I've been hitting the books all these days. [Person1]:  Why have you been studying so hard? [Person2]:  I need to review my English. [Person1]:  So that's what keeps you so busy recently! [Person2]:  Yes, I've been tied up with my studies. Now, what worries me a lot is my English. [Person1]:  But why? Your English is very good. [Person2]:  Thank you. You are very kind. [Person1]:  No, I'm telling the truth. As an American, I understand you quite well. [Person2]:  It's very kind of you to say so.
[Person1]:  What are you doing recently? [Person2]:  I got a job at the restaurant, but it doesn't sound very interesting. [Person1]:  How much will they pay you? [Person2]:  $ 160 a week. [Person1]:  I'd take it if I were you. [Person2]:  But it doesn't sound interesting. [Person1]:  But you need a job, don't you? [Person2]:  But I might find a better job somewhere. [Person1]:  Maybe, but a bird in hand is worth two in the bush. [Person2]:  I think you are right.
[Person1]:  We seem to be having this conversation over and over again. [Person2]:  You're fight. [Person1]:  Look, I know how you feel about my smoking. You don't have to tell me every day. [Person2]:  I'm sorry. I worry about you. [Person1]:  Let's be honest. There's always going to be a reason. After you graduate, it's going to be hard to find a job, then there will be the stress from just starting a job. OK, I get your point. It's just so hard. You don't really understand because you have never smoked. [Person2]:  You need some help. Why don't you go to a doctor? [Person1]:  You mean a psychiatrist? [Person2]:  No, I don't. I mean a general practitioner. Maybe you can get a patch, or some pills, well, I don't know, something to help you with the withdrawal. [Person1]:  Really, I believe I can quit on my own. But I'll think about it. I will. [Person2]:  All fight. I won't mention it for a week. Then I want to know your decision. Because if you don't get some help, I need to rethink our plans. [Person1]:  You mean you'd break our engagement over this? I can't believe it! [Person2]:  I don't know.
[Person1]:  Have we handed out all the water?  [Person2]:  Yes. So what else to do now?  [Person1]:  Nothing. The teacher said the only thing left was to get back all the disposable cups later.  [Person2]:  I see. How do you like the game?  [Person1]:  Terrific. There is one girl said, It is the best game I've ever watched.  [Person2]:  Who do you think do better?  [Person1]:  Clive was really outstanding. Not only he put on a big show himself, but also he inspired the whole team.  [Person2]:  Exactly. He is unbelievable.  [Person1]:  On the other hand, I think the other team won everyone's respect. The leader said they could have crumpled at the beginning, but they just carried on and never lost their cool.  [Person2]:  They were really tough.  [Person1]:  The thing I like most about them is that they did not play with a heavy heart even though at that time the odds seemed to be against them.  [Person2]:  I can't agree more. Okay, time is up. Let's do the last thing. 
[Person1]:  Do you know who Ammo Hung is? [Person2]:  Of course. He is now 50 years old. And he started out studying alembics, singing, dancing and martial arts at the age of nine, and has tarred in 140 kung fu films. He has also become an independent producer and director. [Person1]:  You know only one aspect of him. Do you know what he would do in the kitchen? [Person2]:  I have no idea. Tell me. [Person1]:  In the kitchen, with his wife by his side he still puts on quite a dinner time show. [Person2]:  What does he do there? [Person1]:  Imagine a chef chopping vegetables on fast forward. Picture a man making a stir-fry, tossing the mixture up in the air, and then catching it, every last bit, in his work. And his culinary motto is'Enjoy the moment. 'If you want to know hey theycook, visit www. StudioClassroom. com. tw for the recipe.
[Person1]:  Every honored guests, welcome to Hang Thou. Now we are visiting Tiger-running Spring. [Person2]:  How can we relate tiger to this spot, Miss Zhang? [Person1]:  Its name originates from a legend that two tigers run here and made a hole, and then a spring gushed out from it. [Person2]:  How ignorant I am! [Person1]:  The Longing Tea and the Tiger-running Spring water are always considered as the ' Two Wonders in West Lake. ' [Person2]:  I know that tea. It smells fragrant. [Person1]:  That's right. All my guests, attention please. We will have half an hour to visit the spring and take photos. And next spot will be the Moon Reflected in Three Pools. [Person2]:  Janice, David, come here. We take some photos here. I can't imagine how beautiful it is!

[Person1]:  Do you take your dog for a walk every day? [Person2]:  No. My father and I do it together. My father takes the dog for a walk every Monday, Tuesday and Sunday. And I take the dog for a walk every Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. [Person1]:  Who takes the dog on Saturday? [Person2]:  On Saturday we all go to the park and the dog comes with us. [Person1]:  Do you help with the housework? [Person2]:  My mum and my sister do the housework and cooking but I clean my room.
[Person1]:  Do you have experience in advertising? [Person2]:  Yes, I used to have a part-time job in advertising company. [Person1]:  What were you mean duties there? [Person2]:  I mostly did advertising planning. [Person1]:  What qualities do you think an advertising planner should have? [Person2]:  I think an advertising planner should have active thoughts, creative talent, and be sensitive to the changes in the market. [Person1]:  What was the most important thing you have learned at work? [Person2]:  The most important thing I learned was that I must continuously improve my abilities. Advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact to success. If I want to make in marking in advertising industry, I can ' t stop studying and creating.
[Person1]:  Excuse me. I'm looking for Bluemingdails. Could you tell me how to get there? [Person2]:  Sure. It's very close actually. You go straight down this road. Then you turn left, at the next junction. [Person1]:  Left the next junction. Ok. [Person2]:  Bluemingdails is on the corner of that block. You see it as you turn left. Seriously, You can't miss it. It's enormous. [Person1]:  Thanks very much.
[Person1]:  What's the matter, Lisa? You don't look too good. [Person2]:  I just found out that my husband is cheating on me. [Person1]:  You mean Mark? He seems like such an honest guy. [Person2]:  That's what I thought. It seems that he's been seeing someone else for about two months. [Person1]:  Two months? How did you find out? [Person2]:  I asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang. I picked it up and a girl asked to talk to Mark. She then asked if I was his sister, and I said no, I was his wife. She hung up immediately. [Person1]:  So you asked him about the girl who called? [Person2]:  Yeah, he first said it was someone from work. He gave me a lame excuse, and so I pressed him on it. [Person1]:  What'd he do? [Person2]:  He kept trying to make stupid excuses, and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion.
[Person1]:  I can't seem to progress up the career ladder no matter how hard I try and I have been here for 2 years already! [Person2]:  Well, have you thought of getting an MBA? I heard it does wonders in getting you to the top. [Person1]:  An MBA, hey. . . well my degree wasn't in business, the business schools won't be interested in me. [Person2]:  Nonsense! The business schools measure your ability through a test called GMAT. [Person1]:  GMAT? What does that stand for and what will the test contain? [Person2]:  Graduate Management Admission Test, it contains three parts [Person1]:  Okay, this sounds a little tough, how am I supposed to practice for this? [Person2]:  Up to you, you could have a one on one session with a tutor or group sessions, you can also use free or private computer software. Going to church might help as well! [Person1]:  No matter what I do, I'm going to ace this test and go on to become a corporate fat cat! [Person2]:  Umm. . . That's the spirit!
[Person1]:  Excuse me, Sir, May I have the time, please? [Person2]:  Beg your pardon? [Person1]:  Er. . . I'd like to know what time it is now. [Person2]:  Oh, Let me see. . . It's three forty-five. Er. . . wait, My watch is five minutes fast. So it should be three forty [Person1]:  Thank you. By the way, what day is today? [Person2]:  Today is Friday. Are you new in Beijing? [Person1]:  Yes, I've just come from the States, yesterday in fact. I'm still a bit confused about the time. [Person2]:  Welcome to Beijing. This is my business card. I'm an engineer. If you need any help in Beijing, just give me a call. [Person1]:  Oh, that's very nice of you. I don't want to sound pushy, but I still l have one more question. [Person2]:  Go ahead. [Person1]:  What's the date today? [Person2]:  It's October the 1st, our National Day. I'd like to talk some more, but I've got to get going now. It was nice talking to you, though. [Person1]:  Yeah, it was nice to meet you. Hope I run into you again sometime.
[Person1]:  Hello, Sir. What can we do for you today? [Person2]:  Hello. I've been asked to come and see about something called L / C? What is it exactly? [Person1]:  L / C stands for'letter of credit'. This is necessary for trade between two countries. A Letter of Credit is quite literally that, a letter addressed by the buyer's bank to the seller's bank stating that they could vouch for their good customer, the buyer, and that they would pay the seller in case of the buyer's default. Nowadays, it's sometimes used for domestic trade too. [Person2]:  So the other party could be across the world or just on the other side of the street!
[Person1]:  Okay, here's the lease. Read it over before you sign it. As you can see, the deposit is $ 300. [Person2]:  Oh, okay. I can get it back when I move out, right? [Person1]:  Yes, assuming there's been no damage to the apartment. Before you move in, you can make a list of any marks, scratches, and so forth that are already there. [Person2]:  All right. Here's the lease and the check for the deposit. [Person1]:  Great. You can move in next Monday. Your first month's rent is due then.
[Person1]:  I'm going to the United Stated to attend my daughter's commencement. [Person2]:  How nice! Are you going to convert some RMB to US dollars? [Person1]:  Yes. But I will not take much cash with me I can ask the bank to give me the traveler's checks. So it will be safer. [Person2]:  How can you cash them when you arrive in the United States? [Person1]:  I will go to the bank, give them my check, show them one piece of my identifications, and the most important thing is that I should sign my name to endorse the check. [Person2]:  It sounds quite simple. Next time when I travel abroad, I will apply for this kind of check too.
[Person1]:  Could I have a word with you, Madam? [Person2]:  Is that you, Janice? Just speaking. [Person1]:  I have to tell you that I can't be in today and tomorrow. [Person2]:  So sorry to hear that. What's wrong with you? [Person1]:  I feel sick and coughed a lot at night. [Person2]:  Is that serious? You ought to see a doctor. [Person1]:  Yes, I did this in the morning. And my doctor wanted me to have a rest these two days. [Person2]:  That's good. Do you suppose you will be back at company the day after tomorrow? [Person1]:  I hope so. And I will definitely tell you if I can not. [Person2]:  Well, take care of yourself. And hope you will be better as soon as possible.
[Person1]:  What time is it now? [Person2]:  It's half past seven. I think we will be late for the film. [Person1]:  Don't worry. There is still twenty minutes to go. [Person2]:  But it's three kilometers from here to the cinema. How can we get there in such a short time? [Person1]:  I think we can walk there in twenty minutes. [Person2]:  But I am afraid I can't walk that far. [Person1]:  If you don't feel like walking, we can take a taxi. [Person2]:  Hey, taxi!
[Person1]:  Bye, Mark, have a nice weekend. [Person2]:  Thanks, same to you. Doing anything exciting? [Person1]:  No, not really. We were thinking of going to the beach, but I don't think Martin is well enough to go. So he will probably stay in and watch TV. And I'll plant the rose bushes I bought yesterday.
[Person1]:  Maths Department, Dr. Webster speaking. [Person2]:  Hello, Professor Webster. This is Janet Hill calling. I live two doors down from your teaching assistant, Don Williams. Don asked me to call you because he's lost his voice and can't talk to you himself. [Person1]:  Lost his voice? That's too bad. Is there anything I can do for him? [Person2]:  Well, he has a class this afternoon from 2 [Person1]:  Does he want me to try to find somebody else to teach it? [Person2]:  No, not exactly. What he wants to do is to get someone to go in for him-just to pass back the mid term exam papers. He's already marked them. And they're on the desk in his office. The whole thing wouldn't take more than...Oh, ten minutes or so. [Person1]:  2 [Person2]:  Carter Hall, Room 214. Will you need his office key to get the exams? I could bring it to you. [Person1]:  Well, actually, that won't be necessary. We have a master key in the Maths Department, so I can get into his office. [Person2]:  Thank you, Professor Webster. [Person1]:  My pleasure.
[Person1]:  Well, do you have anything planned for this Saturday? [Person2]:  Er, I'm kind of busy. Why do you ask? [Person1]:  I was wondering if we could get together and do something, like going to a concert or taking a walk by the lake. [Person2]:  I'd love to, but I'm really busy this weekend. [Person1]:  That's too bad. [Person2]:  I have promised to help with the cleaning of the house at 10 [Person1]:  How about after the dentist's appointment? [Person2]:  Then, I'll have to meet Jim at 4 [Person1]:  OK, then, maybe some other time.
[Person1]:  Cindy, I have this room to myself?  [Person2]:  It's all yours.  [Person1]:  It's twice as big as my room in Taiwan!  [Person2]:  Well, I hope it's comfortable enough for you.  [Person1]:  I think I'm going to like it here.  [Person2]:  You have a phone on the bedside table that you can use.  [Person1]:  Wow, I have my own bathroom!  [Person2]:  Kind of. It leads to my bedroom.  [Person1]:  We share the same bathroom, in other words. 
[Person1]:  Morning, Charles. [Person2]:  Morning, Diana. How was your Christmas? [Person1]:  Great! [Person2]:  Where did you go? [Person1]:  I went to London and stayed with my uncle for 2 weeks. [Person2]:  How lucky! How did you get there? [Person1]:  By air, of course. What about you? [Person2]:  I went to visit my grandparents at a village in France. I often go there, if I have free time. [Person1]:  Great. I've never been to the countryside. What did you do there? [Person2]:  Many things, I fed chickens, water plants, and rode horses. [Person1]:  That sounds fantastic. Did you go there with your parents? [Person2]:  No, I went with my brother, Mark. Oh, hurry up, it's time for class. [Person1]:  Alright.
[Person1]:  What are you writing online? [Person2]:  I'm replying to a man's article in the forum. [Person1]:  Do you know him? [Person2]:  No, I think his viewpoint expressed in the forum is wrong, so I want to show him my opinion. [Person1]:  Do you do that kind of thing often? [Person2]:  Yes, I like to discuss with different people online. [Person1]:  What do you usually talk about? [Person2]:  Any topic. Politics, science, film stars, in a word, everything in the world! [Person1]:  Sounds interesting. [Person2]:  I think so, but sometimes we may start a flamewar in the Forum. [Person1]:  War? You fight with each other online? But how is that possible? [Person2]:  Haha, we do not fight face to face. The main tool for us to use is our words expressed in the forum. [Person1]:  I see.
[Person1]:  I was going to make myself some tea. Do you want some? [Person2]:  No, thanks. I'm fine with my coffee. [Person1]:  You know, it's not healthy to drink so much coffee. How many cups do you have every day anyway? [Person2]:  More than 3 cups I guess. [Person1]:  And do you put cream and sugar in your coffee? [Person2]:  When I drink hot coffee, I always add cream and sugar, but when I drink iced coffee, I only add cream. [Person1]:  Do you usually drink both hot and iced coffee in the same day? [Person2]:  Well, I need at least 2 cups of hot coffee in the morning. Otherwise I just can't wake up. In the afternoon I like to have iced coffee, but I never have iced coffee after dinner. [Person1]:  Don't you worry that you might get addicted to coffee? [Person2]:  Um, I'm not worried at all. Look, I don't smoke. I don't drink alcohol and I don't buy a bunch of expensive stuff that I don't need. Therefore, I don't think drinking coffee is a dangerous thing in my life. And instead it has already become a habit of mine.
[Person1]:  A guy in my office got the flu the other day. Today I seem to have come down with it, too. [Person2]:  Very likely. You have a slight fever. Do you have a headache, too? [Person1]:  Yes. I wonder if you could do something to help me recover soon, because I'll be on a business trip in two days. [Person2]:  Well, you have to let your flu run its course. You must stop working and stay in bed to get plenty of rest. Usually it will take 4 to 6 days to make a full recovery. [Person1]:  But I'm going on a business trip in two days! [Person2]:  Maybe you'll have to cancel it or postpone it. If you go out while you are sick, it won't help you recover. You may even pass your disease on to others.
[Person1]:  I am so busy today. [Person2]:  Can I help you? [Person1]:  I'm not sure. Perhaps you could do the shopping. [Person2]:  I'll be glad to help. [Person1]:  Or maybe make the beds. [Person2]:  All you have to do is ask for help. [Person1]:  Thanks. That's terrific! [Person2]:  I'm ready and willing to help.
[Person1]:  May I help you? [Person2]:  I'm returning a book. [Person1]:  Do you need anything else? [Person2]:  I also need to check out this video. [Person1]:  This is all you want to check out? [Person2]:  Just the video. [Person1]:  I'm going to need your library card. [Person2]:  I have it right here. [Person1]:  You'll need to take care of the video. [Person2]:  I will. [Person1]:  We will fine you if you damage it. [Person2]:  I get it. Thank you.
[Person1]:  Julia, why have you prepared a candlelight dinner? Anything special to celebrate? Did you get a promotion? [Person2]:  Honey, don't tell me that you forgot our anniversary, did you? [Person1]:  Oh, my dear, how can I forget such an important day? I was just kidding. Look at this box. [Person2]:  What's in it? [Person1]:  Have a guess. [Person2]:  A necklace? [Person1]:  No. [Person2]:  I have no idea. [Person1]:  Open it now. [Person2]:  Oh, my god. A diamond brooch. It's so beautiful. You're so kind to me, A. Thank you! [Person1]:  You're welcome, honey. I hope we will celebrate our golden wedding anniversary in future.
[Person1]:  Can I help you? [Person2]:  Yes, would you like to tell me what's playing for tonight? [Person1]:  Sure. There is a folk concert tonight. [Person2]:  Are there any good seats left? [Person1]:  Sorry. There are only some seats in the back. [Person2]:  Well, what time does it begin? [Person1]:  It begins at 7 p. m. . [Person2]:  OK. I see. [Person1]:  How many tickets do you want? [Person2]:  Just two. [Person1]:  OK. Fifty yuan for each. [Person2]:  Here is the money.
[Person1]:  Excuse me. Can you tell me how to find some books on social science? [Person2]:  Sure. You see all these little drawers here and all the way around the walls? [Person1]:  Yes. [Person2]:  These drawers contain cards describing every book in our library. Together they constitute the library's ' card catalog '. You can see that each drawer runs from one part of the alphabet to another. Fox example, this drawer goes from SCA to SCM. [Person1]:  So if I'm looking for a look called A History of Western Society, I'd just look under'A'. [Person2]:  No. You'd look under'W'. The articles'a'and'the'don't count in our alphabetization, and cards are generally omitted for extremely common words and phrases such as'history of', 'introduction to', 'story of'and so forth. [Person1]:  What if I don't know the title of the book? [Person2]:  Well, you can look under the author's name. [Person1]:  Could you give me an example? [Person2]:  Suppose you want to find a book by your professor, William Smith. You'd look under SMITH and then WILLIAM. Since that's very common name, you may have to go through several'William Smith'until you come to the one who wrote book on the subject you are interested in.
[Person1]:  So, what do you think? How do you like New York? [Person2]:  I'm having a great time. I love it. I'm glad we came. [Person1]:  Yeah. I really like the stores and the shopping. [Person2]:  I love the museums, too. [Person1]:  But the traffic is pretty bad. [Person2]:  Yeah. I hate all this traffic. It's really noisy. [Person1]:  Listen, it's almost dinnertime. There are lots of restaurant around here. What do you want to try? Italian? Greek? Japanese? Thai? [Person2]:  I can't stand making decisions. You choose! [Person1]:  OK. Let's go American. Where's the nearest McDonald's?
[Person1]:  I think we should home school our children when we decide to have kids. [Person2]:  What? Why? [Person1]:  Well, our public schools here are not very good and private school are just too expensive. I have been reading up on home schooling and it has a lot of advantages. [Person2]:  Like what? I think that by doing something like that we would be isolating our children from social interaction. [Person1]:  Well, first of all, I would be able to teach them everything they learn in school in a more relaxed and fun way. I also think that having a one-on-one class is much better since you can focus more on his or her strengths or weaknesses. [Person2]:  I think neither your parents or mine would agree to such an idea. [Person1]:  I will bring it up over Sunday brunch. [Person2]:  Good luck with that!
[Person1]:  I am wondering if you have a room with twin bed. [Person2]:  Yes, we have one and it faces the beautiful sea. [Person1]:  That's wonderful. I want to stay for 2 days. [Person2]:  OK, we will make it ready for you. [Person1]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  Guess what, Gilly? I won both bids. [Person2]:  Good for you. Did you use Paypal? [Person1]:  Yeah. It was so easy and super-fast, once I figured it out. [Person2]:  That's the beauty of it, and the danger. [Person1]:  I should get the items within a week. But in the meantime I'm bidding on a digital video camera. [Person2]:  How much? [Person1]:  Thirty U. S. dollars. . . and it's only been used for six months. [Person2]:  Mmmm, sounds like risky business. Good luck.
[Person1]:  I simply couldn't help giving him the fish-eye when I knew all that. [Person2]:  But Ben is not a bad man. I know him from A to Z. [Person1]:  However, he disappointed us very much this time. [Person2]:  I can understand that. But. . .
[Person1]:  That China-gown of Tang-Dynasty style is so beautiful. Would you show it to me, please?  [Person2]:  Absolutely. Here it is.  [Person1]:  Could I try it on?  [Person2]:  Please do, the fitting-room is over there.  [Person1]:  It feels a little tight around the waist. Do you have a bigger one?  [Person2]:  I'm sorry. We don't have this color in your size. We have some green ones in your size. Would you please have a look at this green one?  [Person1]:  OK. How much does it cost?  [Person2]:  It's 486 yuan. 
[Person1]:  Hello, Jill.  [Person2]:  Tom, You're back, come in please. How are you?  [Person1]:  Fine, only a little tired.  [Person2]:  You'll recover after a good night's sleep.  [Person1]:  Thank you very much for looking after my house in my absence.  [Person2]:  That's all right. Would you have a cup of coffee?  [Person1]:  Yes, Please. It's very kind of you.  [Person2]:  Don't mention it.  [Person1]:  The rooms are very tidy and the flowers grew very well. You are very helpful. I want to thank you for everything you've done for me.  [Person2]:  It's my pleasure.  [Person1]:  I bought you some books on literature, I don't know if you would like them.  [Person2]:  Thank you. Thank you for the trouble you've taken.  [Person1]:  Not at all. 
[Person1]:  Good morning, Jason. How did you sleep?  [Person2]:  Pretty well, thanks. Still feeling the effects of jet lag a bit, but last night I got at lease six hours of rest.  [Person1]:  Great! So, are you ready for a full day of shopping?  [Person2]:  Yep. Let's do it. I'm pretty excited!  [Person1]:  I know a place that should be perfect. It's called the China Friendship Shopping Center and it's pretty much like an American mall - except with more variety. You can even buy a live chicken there if you want.  [Person2]:  Live chicken? Thanks, but no thanks. So. . . . tell me about bargaining. How can I do it like a local?  [Person1]:  Well. I'll be honest and say you'll never be as good at bargaining as a local person. You're a foreigner and the sellers can see that. But. . . if you're smart, you can get bargains that are not too far away from the local price.  [Person2]:  Cool! Teach me!  [Person1]:  For starters, you want to do a lot of scouting first. You've got to know what things cost.  [Person2]:  Someone told me to go to a convenience store and see how much a soft drink or a tube of toothpaste costs. The idea is that by comparing the prices of those items, you can figure out the relative prices of everything else.  [Person1]:  That could be helpful. But when you go into a shopping center. . . prices become very flexible. You have to be able to read the market. 
[Person1]:  Thank you for lending me the book.  [Person2]:  Sure. But it's a very difficult one, you need to have a dictionary at your elbow.  [Person1]:  But I'm not used to looking up every new word when I'm reading a novel. I only look up the most necessary ones. 
[Person1]:  Hi, George. I'm going to have a job interview next week. Could you give me some advice? [Person2]:  Sure. First of all, it ' s very important for you not to be late. Job interviewers usually don ' t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time, only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic. [Person1]:  Yeah, that's very important. [Person2]:  So you ' d better explore the place the day before and at the same time, look around to see what the employees are wearing. So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment. [Person1]:  I ' ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer. [Person2]:  That ' s right. You need to create a good image in a limited time, usually about 30 to 45 minutes. [Person1]:  It ' s always easier to say something than to do it. [Person2]:  It ' s not too difficult to make a good impression. For example, you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed. Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style. This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications. [Person1]:  But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans. [Person2]:  I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview. Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job, or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes. [Person1]:  It ' s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes. [Person2]:  You misunderstood me. Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job, or that you are snobbish or frivolous. [Person1]:  I know what you mean. I ought to wear right clothes at the right time. [Person2]:  You got it. Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement. [Person1]:  It seems that ' clothes make the man '. [Person2]:  It may not be true, but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior.
[Person1]:  Which film shall we see? [Person2]:  There is nothing good at the moment. Let's do something different. Would you like to go to a concert? [Person1]:  Yes, I'd love to. Here is a good one, Mozart and Beethoven. It's on the Festival Hall. Shall we go there? [Person2]:  Fine! Do you want anything to eat now? [Person1]:  No, I'm not hungry. [Person2]:  Well, let's go and have something to drink instead. I know a good place. It's a little expensive, but it's fun.
[Person1]:  Can I help you? [Person2]:  My wife and I want to go to Beijing for a tour. Can you arrange it? [Person1]:  Yes, we can arrange that. [Person2]:  I'd like to know what kind of tour your travel agency has. [Person1]:  Our travel agency provides all kinds of tours, ranging from individual tour to group package tour. [Person2]:  Excellent. [Person1]:  When do you expect to come? [Person2]:  September 28th. [Person1]:  What specific places do you wish to visit? [Person2]:  We would like to visit the Great Wall, the Ming Tombs and the Imperial Palace. [Person1]:  OK.
[Person1]:  Hey, let's eat out tonight. [Person2]:  What's the occasion? You won the lottery? [Person1]:  No. Just want to relax a little bit. You don't have to win the lottery to relax, do you? [Person2]:  Well, I am kind of broke. [Person1]:  Come on. It's on me. [Person2]:  Really? It's very nice of you. [Person1]:  Don't be silly. I'll take you anywhere you wanna go. [Person2]:  Wonderful! You know what? I wish you wanted to relax everyday. [Person1]:  Dream on!
[Person1]:  Would you mind taking your feet off the table, Mike? [Person2]:  Not at all. But I've found satisfaction in it! [Person1]:  Do you put your feet on your own table? [Person2]:  No, I never do that. [Person1]:  Why not? [Person2]:  I don't want to mark my table, of course. [Person1]:  Well, will you please put them down? [Person2]:  I'm sorry. I thought you wouldn't come back so early. [Person1]:  I forgot something on the table. [Person2]:  Oh, you've got a good memory.
[Person1]:  What are your strengths and weaknesses? [Person2]:  As I said, I am diligent and industrious. On the other hand, I am too hard-working and I put myself under much pressure to make things perfect. [Person1]:  What is your problem in working? [Person2]:  I am too introverted to let others become my friends.
[Person1]:  Oh dear, I'm late. I have to be in the office by 8am. [Person2]:  Oh really what's happening? [Person1]:  Well there is an important meeting with a new client. [Person2]:  Ok but you must stay calm. Do you want me to give you a lift? [Person1]:  Oh, you don't have to do that but it would be a great help. [Person2]:  Ok, wait one minute. I must remember where I left the keys.
[Person1]:  Did you hear that famous speech by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez? [Person2]:  What was it about? [Person1]:  He said that only education will lift Latin America out of poverty. [Person2]:  When and where did he give the speech? [Person1]:  In the southern city of Cusco, where he was attending a conference on December 10th. 1700 students were present. He told the students to read Victor Hugo's classic novel Les Miserables to understand poverty. [Person2]:  Hugo Chavez must think highly of that novel. [Person1]:  Yes, he said he was reading the novel for the second time. He was impressed by its description of human misery. But he truly believes that poverty in Latin America will eventually be eliminated.
[Person1]:  Miss Liu, please come in. [Person2]:  What can I do for you, sir? [Person1]:  Copy this report for me. [Person2]:  OK. But which size should I use? [Person1]:  You should use the A4 paper is all right. [Person2]:  I see. Should I have it bound? [Person1]:  It is unnecessary. [Person2]:  That is all right.
[Person1]:  Excuse me. Can I help you? [Person2]:  Er... Could I have some writing paper and envelopes? [Person1]:  Do you mean paper for writing letters? [Person2]:  Yes. [Person1]:  They are here in the showcase. Which one would you like? [Person2]:  I want this kind of paper and that kind of envelope. [Person1]:  All right, sir. Anything else? [Person2]:  Yes, five fifty-- cent stamps. [Person1]:  Er... There will be four dollars and sixty cents altogether. [Person2]:  Here is five dollars. [Person1]:  Thank you. Here is the change. [Person2]:  Thanks.
[Person1]:  hi, Emally, do you know that guy over there?  [Person2]:  The tall one? Sure, that's Daive, he works with Lily.  [Person1]:  He is cute. What dose he do?  [Person2]:  I'm not sure, he is a manager I think.  [Person1]:  Really? Are you going to introduce us?  [Person2]:  Well, he has already taken you know, that's his wife right there. 
[Person1]:  Are you a smoker?  [Person2]:  Yes, I'm afraid I am. My husband is a smoker too.  [Person1]:  Would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker?  [Person2]:  No. But my husband smokes 20 or more a day.  [Person1]:  When did you begin to smoke?  [Person2]:  I had my first cigarette when I was 17.  [Person1]:  Might I ask if you have tried to give up smoking?  [Person2]:  Yes. Twice. 
[Person1]:  I left a suitcase on the train to London the other day.  [Person2]:  Can you describe it, sir?  [Person1]:  It's a small blue case and it's got a zip. There's a label on the handle with my name and address on it.  [Person2]:  Is this case yours?  [Person1]:  No, that's not mine.  [Person2]:  What about this one? This one's got a label.  [Person1]:  Let me see it.  [Person2]:  What's you name and address?  [Person1]:  David Hall, 83, Bridge Street.  [Person2]:  That's right. D. N. Hall. 83. Bridge Street. Three pound and fifty pence please.  [Person1]:  Here you are.  [Person2]:  Thank you.  [Person1]:  Hey!  [Person2]:  What's the matter?  [Person1]:  This case doesn't belong to me! You've given me the wrong case! 
[Person1]:  Excuse me. Where is Martin Luther King School? [Person2]:  What? [Person1]:  Where is Martin...? [Person2]:  Wait a minute. Let me turn off my car. Now, what were you saying? [Person1]:  Where is Martin Luther King School? [Person2]:  Hum...Go along the road and turn right. [Person1]:  Wait. I have a map. [Person2]:  Good. Look, we're here and there's the school. [Person1]:  I see. I just go along the road. [Person2]:  Then turn right. [Person1]:  Turn right and go straight. [Person2]:  Martin Luther King School is next to the bank. [Person1]:  Wonderful, thank you. [Person2]:  You're welcome.
[Person1]:  Tom is just not my type, and he's not interested in me. [Person2]:  So, what's he doing? [Person1]:  He is interested in taking piano lessons. [Person2]:  A computer kid wants to study piano? [Person1]:  That's what his friend told me, he'll be my first adult student. [Person2]:  Well, if he likes piano, he could be your type after all. [Person1]:  Don't count on him, he's just my student.
[Person1]:  How are your new neighbors Nancy? [Person2]:  They seem nice enough, but they have a son, who's driving me crazy. [Person1]:  What do you mean? [Person2]:  He comes home every night around 10 [Person1]:  Oh no. [Person2]:  Oh yes, sometimes it takes us till midnight just to get them to settle down again. [Person1]:  Have you tried talking to them? [Person2]:  We haven't even really met them yet except to say a quick hello. I hate to get off on the wrong foot. [Person1]:  You are not going to like them when you do meet them if he keep on simmering. [Person2]:  I know, but I feel stupid complaining. [Person1]:  You said yourself is driving you crazy. [Person2]:  Well, you know how early I have to get up to be here at the office. I'm just not getting enough sleep and neither are the kids. They're so irritable when I get home in the afternoon. [Person1]:  Maybe you could go over some time with a little gift or planned for the yard or something. Then you could ask about their son whether they have any other children and they'll be sure to ask about yours. [Person2]:  Yeah, and then what? [Person1]:  Then you could mention that the hardest thing at this stage is getting your kids to get to sleep at night. [Person2]:  And keeping them asleep. [Person1]:  That's the idea and you should do it soon. The longer you wait, the harder it will be to do politely.
[Person1]:  Did you ever take history 231? [Person2]:  Yeah, last semester. [Person1]:  I took the course this semester. What do you think about the professor? [Person2]:  He's a terrible instructor and demands a lot, but fortunately, he's an easy grader. [Person1]:  What did you end up getting? [Person2]:  I got an A minus. Sounds good but none of my test scores were that high. So I don't know how I got a decent grade. Are you enjoying the class so far? [Person1]:  I hate it, and I was about to withdraw. But after hearing your experience, I think I will tough it out. [Person2]:  Yes, definitely stay in the class, you will get a better grade than your test scores. He does that deliberately to make all the students study a lot. [Person1]:  Thanks for letting me know. I feel relieved now.
[Person1]:  I hate spring in this city. It's always raining. We hardly get any sunshine. [Person2]:  You're right. It's terrible. [Person1]:  Summer will soon be here. I like summer very much. [Person2]:  Summer? I can't stand it. It's too hot, especially if you have to take the bus to work like I do. [Person1]:  Well. I can't imagine that, but I really hate the rain. [Person2]:  I don't mind it really. [Person1]:  But summer in Qingdao is lovely, especially the beach. I usually spend the summer there. Peter and I go there every summer. You can come with us next time, Brian. I'm sure you will enjoy lying on the beach very much. [Person2]:  No, thanks. I prefer a more active holiday. [Person1]:  For example? [Person2]:  Well, I was thinking of climbing mountain Huang. [Person1]:  Climb the mountain? Oh, after a day of climbing, you will be very tired and won't want like to do anything. [Person2]:  Perhaps, but I don't mind.
[Person1]:  What kind of place shall we rent? [Person2]:  It should be close to the university. Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is, the later we can get up. [Person1]:  Absolutely. That's the most important thing to take into consideration. I'm not too worried about the size of the flat. [Person2]:  Neither am I. so a small place is ok, but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive. Do you mind if it's in a noisy area. [Person1]:  I don't mind. I'm not a light sleeper, but quieter is better for when we have to study at home. [Person2]:  Good point. Ok, let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us. [Person1]:  Yes, if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days. I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early. [Person2]:  How much do you think the rent will be? [Person1]:  I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month.
[Person1]:  I am really interested in buying this television. [Person2]:  That's so great! [Person1]:  How much are you selling it for? [Person2]:  This t. v is only $ 2500. [Person1]:  You can't be serious. [Person2]:  That's how much this t. v costs. [Person1]:  That's too expensive for me. [Person2]:  This television is of very high quality. [Person1]:  You can't go down on the price. [Person2]:  By how much? [Person1]:  I'll buy it for $ 2000. [Person2]:  I'm sorry, but the price is final.
[Person1]:  hi, darling! I have a one-month vacation saved up. How about a trip to Europe? [Person2]:  I could go for that. But I'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year. [Person1]:  oh, but I really need to leave this town for a change. Working day after day has worn me out. Do you have any other suggestions? [Person2]:  we should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away. How about the countryside? There must be many interesting places, and we could enjoy the fresh air and the delicious local spec [Person1]:  wonderful! I think that's a great idea. How soon until we can make this happen? I can't wait! [Person2]:  tomorrow I have an appointment with my dentist. What about next Monday? [Person1]:  perfect. I'll start preparing tomorrow. If we're going to drive, I'll need to fill up the tank. [Person2]:  no need. I think it's still plenty full. Even so, I'd rather travel by bus or train. It would cost much less than driving. Oil prices are soaring nowadays, you know. [Person1]:  we can take the train, that will be faster. I'll book the tickets tomorrow morning. [Person2]:  great! Oh, one more thing, don't forget to check the weather before we go. I'd hate to get caught in the rain. [Person1]:  no problem. I'm really looking forward to the coming week. [Person2]:  Me, too. Now let's make a list for what we need to take with us.
[Person1]:  Hey Suzie. Guess what? I'm having a baby! [Person2]:  Really? That's so great. Congratulations. [Person1]:  Thanks. I'm so excited. We've been trying for 8 months now. [Person2]:  That's really exciting. How many months are you pregnant? [Person1]:  Three months. [Person2]:  Are you going to find out if it is a boy or a girl? [Person1]:  I want to, but Bob doesn't. He wants to be surprised like the old fashioned way. [Person2]:  Maybe it's more exciting not knowing. [Person1]:  I'd rather know and buy all the baby things ahead of time. [Person2]:  There are so many things you have to prepare for. [Person1]:  I know I am going to be busy, but I know I can handle it. I have been looking forward to this day for a long long time. [Person2]:  It really must be an exciting time for you guys. [Person1]:  Thank you so much.
[Person1]:  Have you received any degrees? [Person2]:  Yes. In 1996 I received my Bachelor of Science degree from Hebes University, and in 2001 I received my MBA degree from Peking University. [Person1]:  How about your academic records at college? [Person2]:  In fact my records were excellent. My overall GPA was 9 on a 10 scale, which was the highest in my class. [Person1]:  That's very impressive. Which course did you like best? [Person2]:  English. It was both interesting and useful, so I showed a great interest in it. [Person1]:  Can you tell me why you changed your major when you were a graduate student? [Person2]:  Because I am very interested in administration and I did take some courses in it. I also performed well in the subjects. Hence I believe that I can do a good job in this position. [Person1]:  Did you get any honors and awards at college? [Person2]:  Yes. I was awarded a scholarship from the university every year. In 1995 I participated in the National Contest of Maths Models and I won the prize.
[Person1]:  Would you like to mail it by air or sea? [Person2]:  Hmm. . . How long will it take to mail things to the USA by air? [Person1]:  About 10 days. You can send it express mail if you need it faster. It will only take three or four days. [Person2]:  I want to send it by express mail. The faster, the better. [Person1]:  OK, the postage is 275 yuan. [Person2]:  Here you go. [Person1]:  This is the receipt, please keep it. Have a good day. [Person2]:  Thanks.
[Person1]:  do you like cooking, Julia? [Person2]:  I really enjoy it, especially when it ends up tasting good! [Person1]:  how often do you usually cook? [Person2]:  I usually make a few salads for lunch throughout the week and I make dinner about 6 times a week. [Person1]:  that's a lot of cooking. You must save a lot of money by eating at home so much. [Person2]:  I do. If you cook at home, you can eat healthy food cheaply. [Person1]:  what kind of dishes do you usually make? [Person2]:  I almost always make either a beef roast or a chicken roast with asparagus, parsnips, peas, carrots and potatoes on Sundays. [Person1]:  do you make a lot of traditional British food? [Person2]:  aside from the Sunday roast, we usually eat dangers and mash, toad-in-the-hole, or fish'n chips once a week. [Person1]:  how about spicy food? [Person2]:  my family loves spicy food. We often eat Chinese, Thai, Indian, or Mexican food when we're in the mood for spice. [Person1]:  what's your favorite dish to make? [Person2]:  I absolutely love making mousaka, which is a Greek dish with eggplant. But it takes a lot of time, so I don't often make it.
[Person1]:  Sam, I am so sorry. It was your birthday yesterday and I completely forgot about it. [Person2]:  Don't worry about it. I keep forgetting everyone's birthdays as well. [Person1]:  Margaret really told me off when she found out that I had forgotten all about it. We did try to phone you, but you and Jane must have gone out. [Person2]:  Yes, Jane invited me for dinner to this new restaurant which opened near us. [Person1]:  Oh, yes, I know the one. How was the food? [Person2]:  The food was excellent, but Jane ordered a birthday cake, which they forgot about. So as you can see, you were not the only one. [Person1]:  Oh, no. [Person2]:  Yes, Jane was quite upset about it. The manager came to apologize and we did get free dessert, but still. . . [Person1]:  I would think this was the least they could do. [Person2]:  In the end it was a nice evening and I got an iPad as my birthday present which I wanted for a while. [Person1]:  Great. I have also been thinking of getting one. Do you think you could ask Jane to have a quiet word with Margaret? My birthday is not that far away. [Person2]:  I can try, but knowing Margaret she will see through that immediately.
[Person1]:  How are you? [Person2]:  I'm fine thanks. How about you? [Person1]:  I'm okay. What are you doing these days? [Person2]:  Not a lot, actually. Busy at work of course - we've got a big project coming up in Malaysia. I may have to go to KL in a few weeks. [Person1]:  That's great. When are you starting? [Person2]:  Probably in a week or two. I'll let you know.
[Person1]:  What's the plot of your new movie? [Person2]:  It's a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders. I play the part of the detective. He has to catch the killer, but there's very little evidence. It's a psychological thriller with some frightening scenes, but I hope audience won't be too scared to go to the movie theatres! [Person1]:  Did you enjoy making the movie? We heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director. [Person2]:  I have had disagreement with every director. I'Ve worked with. We'Ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences. It was the same when I made this movie. I don't know where rumours of my disagreement with Rachel Kelly come from. We got on very well and I hope to work with her again. I enjoyed making the movie very much. [Person1]:  Critics are not very happy with the movies that you'Ve made recently. Does that bother you? [Person2]:  Not at all. The feedback from audience has been great. I care about what they think more than what the critics think. [Person1]:  Did you do you own stunts in the movie? [Person2]:  I wanted to, but my insurance company wouldn't let me. All of my stunts were done by a stuntman. As you know, I used to do my own stunts, but I'll leave that to the experts in future. [Person1]:  Thank you very much for doing this interview. [Person2]:  My pleasure. Have you seen the movie yet? [Person1]:  Yes. I have. I liked it very much. Like you, I was very impressed with Rachel's performance in the movie. She's going to be a star.
[Person1]:  What's up, officer? [Person2]:  Are you aware that you ran through that stop sign? [Person1]:  There was a stop sign? [Person2]:  How could you not notice it? [Person1]:  If there really was a stop sign, I couldn't see it because of the overgrown bushes. [Person2]:  You know. You're right. The bushes are covering the sign. [Person1]:  If I saw the stop sign, I would've stopped for it. [Person2]:  Now that I think about it, I can see how you missed it. [Person1]:  Am I getting a ticket for this? [Person2]:  I'll let you off with a warning. [Person1]:  Thank you, I really do appreciate that. [Person2]:  Don't worry about it. I need to have something done about those bushes.

[Person1]:  Lucy, take my picture here, OK? [Person2]:  Sure. Just a minute. Let me take my camera out. [Person1]:  What's the matter? [Person2]:  I'm not sure. [Person1]:  Is it broken? [Person2]:  I hope not! Oh, I see. [Person1]:  What is it? [Person2]:  The batteries are worn down. I need replace them. [Person1]:  Where can we get batteries? [Person2]:  All photography shops carry them. [Person1]:  OK. Let's take a walk and look for a shop that does.
[Person1]:  I need help figuring out how to use this phone. [Person2]:  Sure. First you pick up the receiver and hit one of the first 3 buttons. Do you hear a tone? [Person1]:  Yes, I hear the tone. [Person2]:  OK. Now you dial 9 on the keypad. Do you hear the tone change? [Person1]:  Yes, it changed. [Person2]:  Well, when you hear it change, that means you have an outside line. Where are you trying to call? [Person1]:  I am trying to call home. [Person2]:  OK. Well, to dial to the outside you just now dial the number. For a call inside the company just hit the extension number. Do you know the extensions? [Person1]:  Yes, I have a list of extensions. [Person2]:  Well, if you ever need help with an extension, you can dial O.
[Person1]:  Can I also take the MET to get there? [Person2]:  Yeah sure, it's much quicker. Do you know how? [Person1]:  No, can I trouble you to lend me a hand? [Person2]:  Ok, not a problem. Let's go to the station. [Person1]:  You have to buy a ticket first. You want to go to Shi Da, right? [Person2]:  Yeah. [Person1]:  Ok, then you need to go to Tai Power Building Station. [Person2]:  Where is that? [Person1]:  Look at the map to see where you are. Then look at where you want to go. The number is how much money you have to pay. [Person2]:  Oh, that's simple enough. [Person1]:  Then, when you have your ticket, you go wait on the platform. [Person2]:  Anything else I should know? [Person1]:  Just remember to hold on to your ticket. You need it to get out of the station when you get there.
[Person1]:  To start with, may I know why you are interested in working for our company? [Person2]:  First, as far as I know, your company has had an impressive growth record. Second, I want to get into the foreign trade business. [Person1]:  Now you are with Quandong Company. What is your chief responsibility there? [Person2]:  I'm in charge of marketing activities in South-East Asia, for example, organizing trade conferences and arranging exhibitions. [Person1]:  Do you have any questions about the job? [Person2]:  Yes. Are the chances for employees to be transferred to overseas branches of the company? [Person1]:  Certainly. This is an international company, and ther're good chances for you to work overseas. [Person2]:  That would be good.
[Person1]:  I'm terribly sorry. I'm late. [Person2]:  I've only been waiting for over an hour, that's all. [Person1]:  Yes, I know, I... I tried to get here in time, but just after I left home, the car broke down. [Person2]:  The car broke down? [Person1]:  Yes, and.., well.., luckily.., there was a garage near me, and.., and it took them a while to repair it. [Person2]:  Why didn't you at least phone? [Person1]:  I would have! But I didn't know the number of the restaurant. [Person2]:  You could have looked it up in the telephone book! [Person1]:  Yes, but... You'll never believe this... I couldn't remember the name of the restaurant. I knew where it was, but forgot the name. [Person2]:  I see, well, it was lucky you find a garage to repair your car.
[Person1]:  Bye for now. [Person2]:  Bye. But where are you going? [Person1]:  The bank, the supermarket and... [Person2]:  Will you buy an exercise book for me? [Person1]:  I guess so. But I'll go to the post office first before I go to the supermarket. [Person2]:  Can you also buy me a pen? The one you gave me last week doesn't work now. [Person1]:  How come? [Person2]:  It fell off the desk and was broken. [Person1]:  Can you be more careful with your things? [Person2]:  Ok. Oh. Can you wait a second? [Person1]:  What for? [Person2]:  You are going to the post office, right? [Person1]:  Yes, so what? [Person2]:  Here's a letter for Sam. Can you post it?
[Person1]:  What's the matter with you? You look angry. [Person2]:  I had words with Jack just now. [Person1]:  Come to the point. Why did you argue? [Person2]:  When I asked him to clean up the bedroom, he didn't listen and left his dirty clothes everywhere. [Person1]:  So you lost your temper? [Person2]:  Yes. How could I bear it? [Person1]:  I hope you'll patch up soon. You should respect each other. [Person2]:  If he doesn't apologize to me, I won't forgive him.
[Person1]:  Have you noticed a lot of differences between your country and ours? [Person2]:  Well, that's a difficult question, but I can think of a few. People here dress quite differently, because the weather is warmer here. We wear winter clothes half the year-thick trousers and warm sweaters. Here, people dress more fashionably. Everyone looks very well dressed. [Person1]:  Is clothing expensive in your country? [Person2]:  Yes, it's more expensive than here. [Person1]:  Do you find it easy to talk to people here? Can you make friends easily? [Person2]:  Oh, yes. It's easy to meet people here, even if we speak different languages. People are the same everywhere. They worry about the same things. They worry about the cost of living and about the future of their children. [Person1]:  Yes, you are dead right.
[Person1]:  What are you reading?  [Person2]:  Gee! You scared me!  [Person1]:  Aha, Fitness Consultant. Very good, Don't you know about the rules in this office?  [Person2]:  Yes, Ma'am. No magazines during the office hours. I'm sorry.  [Person1]:  Well, don't do this again next time. What is it about, anyway?  [Person2]:  It is about sports for white-collar workers, people like you and me.  [Person1]:  What kind of sports?  [Person2]:  Aerobic sports, for example, jogging, yoga, skating...  [Person1]:  Interesting. What were you reading just now?  [Person2]:  Stretching exercise after sitting a long time.  [Person1]:  Really? That sounds interesting!  [Person2]:  Can I have my magazine back now?  [Person1]:  No. It's confiscated for now. And I will return it to you after I finish reading it. 
[Person1]:  Hi, Andy. I am going to Isabel's. Are you coming?  [Person2]:  No. The things are too expensive there for me. I can't afford it.  [Person1]:  That is no problem at all. Isabel's is having a clearance sale, and today is the last day. You don't want to miss such a good chance, do you?  [Person2]:  Really? That's wonderful. Can you wait a second? I need to change.  [Person1]:  All right, but hurry up. It takes you hours to change.  [Person2]:  I will. Do you think we can get something really nice and cheap? I mean this is the last day.  [Person1]:  I think so. They don't sell shoddy cloth for one thing.  [Person2]:  Should we ask Cindy to come along? She saw the evening gown made of silk last month that she wanted to buy very much. She didn't buy it of course. It would cost her three months' salary.  [Person1]:  She already bought that evening gown.  [Person2]:  When?  [Person1]:  Yesterday. She wore that gown last night, and showed it off to everybody at Mr. Mile's party.  [Person2]:  Oh? Isn't that like her.  [Person1]:  Hurry up, will you? We'll have to go to the gas station first.  [Person2]:  All right, all right. I am ready to go. Let's go! 
[Person1]:  Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend?  [Person2]:  Sorry, I thought you knew.  [Person1]:  But you should have told me you were in love with her.  [Person2]:  Didn't I?  [Person1]:  You know you didn't.  [Person2]:  Well, I'm telling you now.  [Person1]:  Yes, but you might have told me before.  [Person2]:  I didn't think you'd be interested.  [Person1]:  You can't be serious. How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her?  [Person2]:  Sorry, I didn't think it mattered.  [Person1]:  Oh, you men! You're all the same. 
[Person1]:  Hey, that's a very nice hairdo you're wearing!  [Person2]:  Oh you're exaggerating. I'm never really good at making hairdo.  [Person1]:  You did it yourself? Wow, you are good!  [Person2]:  Thanks for saying so, but my husband thinks otherwise.  [Person1]:  He's just got no idea of how good you are. 
[Person1]:  I think I going to need some iced water too. Is there an extra charge for that? [Person2]:  Yes, we charge 50 cents for water. [Person1]:  That's fine. Could you give me some more napkins, too? [Person2]:  Sure. Do you need anything else? [Person1]:  Yes, I would also like some sweet and sour sauce and pepper. [Person2]:  I'll put all that into the bag for you. [Person1]:  Do I owe you anything for the sauce, pepper and napkins? [Person2]:  No, there is no charge for those.
[Person1]:  Hey, Ann. Wake up. It's time to get out of bed. [Person2]:  Oh, Dad. Do I have to get up right now? [Person1]:  Yes, or you'll be late. [Person2]:  Why didn't my alarm go off today? [Person1]:  It went off 30 minutes ago. [Person2]:  I must have slept right through it. [Person1]:  Rise and shine. [Person2]:  OK. I know.
[Person1]:  That looks like an interesting book. [Person2]:  It is. It's got pictures of interesting building from all over the world, with brief descriptions of how they were build, their purpose, and so on. [Person1]:  There are the pyramids. It's easy to see how they got that name! they don't have smooth sides though. [Person2]:  They don't now, but most of them did originally. There's picture of the pentagon in the united states. It's very distinctive with its five sides. [Person1]:  Look at that cylindrical office building. I'Ve never been seen one that shape before. [Person2]:  Yes. Usually only TV towers are cylindrical in shape. [Person1]:  TV towers are usually thicker at the bottom than at the top. They're not perfectly cylindrical. [Person2]:  This is the world's largest sports stadium. It's a massive oval. [Person1]:  What sports do they play there? [Person2]:  It says here that it's m mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings. [Person1]:  Is that building a perfect cube? [Person2]:  According to the book, it is. I'Ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube. Look at the building. From the air, it looks like a square with a semi-circle attached to each of its four sides. What [Person1]:  Is says here that it's a war memorial. Now, there's a distinctive structure-the stomium in Brussels. See? It consists of several connected by cylinders. I believe you can go up and down inside it.
[Person1]:  Ms. Green, are the schools more or less similar everywhere throughout the United States, or do they differ in various sections? [Person2]:  The system of public schools is fairly uniform everywhere throughout the United States. [Person1]:  Do most students in the United States attend private schools or public schools? [Person2]:  Most public schools in the United States are very good, and the majority of students attend the public schools. [Person1]:  Which students go to private schools, then? [Person2]:  Children needing special instruction. Children whose parents can afford to send them to private schools, and children whose parents want them to receive a religious education. [Person1]:  But are the public schools good everywhere? [Person2]:  No, public schools can be very different. Even in the same city. [Person1]:  Dose it cost anything to attend the public schools? Are there any restrictions as to who may and may not attend? [Person2]:  The public schools in the United States are free to everyone and there is no cost to the student. In most states, even the textbooks are free. There are no restrictions as to color, race, or religion. Any student wishing to attend the public schools may do so.
[Person1]:  Do you think discrimination against women in the work force is still prevalent even today? [Person2]:  From my own experience as a career woman, I would have to say that while things are getting better now than they used to be, it is still a widespread problem. Society is changing, but there is still a glass ceiling for women in many career tracks. [Person1]:  do you think the glass ceiling phenomena is because of traditional social customs? Or are there more issues coming into play? [Person2]:  I think it's a very complicated issue. A part of the difficulties women have advancing in the work force are due to few opportunities and many male managers. Don't underestimate the good ole'boy system. Men have power, so it's easier for them to stay in power. [Person1]:  What about affirmative action? Hasn't legislation changed a lot of the make hierarchy? [Person2]:  Affirmative action has given us management quotas and bans sexual discrimination, but it's still a man's world.
[Person1]:  Good evening. I've come to see Miss Morrison [Person2]:  Oh! Good evening. I'm sorry, but she is not in. She's gone out to the theatre [Person1]:  Oh! I've just come back from Canada and I've brought a parcel from her parents [Person2]:  Please come in [Person1]:  But you're busy, aren't you? [Person2]:  I was preparing my supper but I've finished now. [Person1]:  I can leave the parcel with you, can't I? [Person2]:  Oh! yes
[Person1]:  Does tea-serving follow any special etiquette in China? Each time I dropped in at my Chinese friends'homes, their parents would offer me a cup of hot, strong tea, though they never inquired of me about whether I want it. [Person2]:  You've got a point there. It is a custom and good manners to serve tea to a guest who comes to pay a visit. There is no need to ask if he needs it or not, or if he wants something else. It might be an insult to the guest if he is left sitting there without being served tea. [Person1]:  So the guest is presumed to be thirsty and in need of some drink after the trip. In that case, I guess, in return, the guest doesn't have to drink it if he wouldn't like it. [Person2]:  It wouldn't be considered rude behavior if he doesn't even take a single drop. But he'd better receive the teacup with both hands and bow his thanks when the cup is brought before his face. When the host pours hot water into his cup, he may also choose to tap his index finger on the table, meaning ' Thanks '. No matter if he likes it or not, it is impolite if he doesn't even lay a finger on the cup. [Person1]:  So next time, I'd better take a few sips, to'save face'at least, right? [Person2]:  Sure. The guest is welcomed by being served tea. But if after chatting for a while, the host asks servants or family members to serve a new cup of tea, or add some hot water, he is giving another signal. [Person1]:  What does that imply, then? [Person2]:  More often than not, the understatement is'I'm afraid it's time you leave'.
[Person1]:  I want to start a tradition of family vacations with our family right now before we have kids. [Person2]:  You want to make sure it's good solid habit before anything else takes its place, like work? [Person1]:  Yes, so this year we are going to take our first family vacation, just you and I. [Person2]:  And where are we going to go? [Person1]:  I don't know yet. [Person2]:  Are we going all out or just starting with a mini family vacation? [Person1]:  I want to go all out if we can afford it. [Person2]:  Well, I was looking in this magazine the other day and cruises are not very expensive at all. Take a look at this!
[Person1]:  I am not sure what to do during the holidays, any suggestions?  [Person2]:  Well, going to a cinema, visiting the galleries, exhibitions and museums, finding and meeting old friends, exercising in the health club or mountain biking. There are so many good choices.  [Person1]:  The problem is that I find all of them are full of fun. I just don't know what to do first.  [Person2]:  Why not start with the most interesting one?  [Person1]:  Actually, I'm interested in all of them. The more choices we have, the harder to make a decision.  [Person2]:  Toss a coin to decide then. 
[Person1]:  Hey Mark. What are you doing?  [Person2]:  Just watching some TV.  [Person1]:  Anything interesting on?  [Person2]:  Not really. Just watching the sports highlight on ESPN.  [Person1]:  So I take it you're pretty bored too.  [Person2]:  Just killing time until I find something to do. What are you going to do?  [Person1]:  It's Saturday and we are sitting at home doing nothing. What's wrong with us?  [Person2]:  You wanna shoot some hoops?  [Person1]:  I already tried to call up some of the guys, but they are all busy.  [Person2]:  Where's your girlfriend? I thought you were going out with her today.  [Person1]:  She's out shopping with her friends.  [Person2]:  Let's go to Starbucks and think of something to do then.  [Person1]:  Aright. Do you have any cigarettes?  [Person2]:  I only have a couple left. Why don't you pick some up on the way.  [Person1]:  Ok. See you there in about 30 minutes.  [Person2]:  Aright. See you there. 
[Person1]:  Excuse me, may I ask you some questions? [Person2]:  Go ahead, please. [Person1]:  I hear that you are going to put on a new play soon. I'd like to know about what you do in the play. Could you explain exactly what you do? [Person2]:  OK, it's a comedy. The director asked me to play the part of a young lady. We are very busy practicing. [Person1]:  When will the play be put on? [Person2]:  We plan to put it on next week. [Person1]:  How do you enjoy your work? [Person2]:  Very much, but we have to practice a lot. We practice the movements and try to remember the lines. [Person1]:  What do you plan to do after this play? [Person2]:  I intend to take part in a film and I'll try to work as a director. [Person1]:  I wish you a lot of success. [Person2]:  Thank you very much.
[Person1]:  How important are friends to you, Bill? [Person2]:  That's kind of a strange question for this setting. Don't you think so? [Person1]:  Well, the teacher hasn't come in yet, class hasn't begun and I was just wondering about it. So what do you think about friends? [Person2]:  I've never regarded them as particularly important. Perhaps that's because I come from a big family, two brothers and three sisters, and lots of cousins. That's what's really important to me. What about you? [Person1]:  My situation, you know, is different. So I have different ideas. To me, friendship is being most important thing in life. It's more important even than love. If you love someone, you can always fall out of love again. And that can lead to a lot of hurt feelings and bitterness. But a good friend is a friend for life.
[Person1]:  Hi. Today, I am the interviewer for your visa application. [Person2]:  OK. Here is my application form and all the documents. [Person1]:  Can you tell me why do you want a visa to America? [Person2]:  Because I want to have a view of the exotic landscapes to extend my views and understanding of the world. [Person1]:  OK. Do you plan to go to America all by yourself or with your family? [Person2]:  Myself. [Person1]:  Have you finished all you preparation? [Person2]:  Yes. Everything is ready.
[Person1]:  Try it on in front of the mirror. [Person2]:  Well, I think the color is a little too bright. [Person1]:  We have darker ones. Do you like the style? [Person2]:  Yes. What's this made of and how to wash it? [Person1]:  lt's made of silk and you had better wash it by hand in cold water.
[Person1]:  Do you think we can go driving right now? [Person2]:  Yeah, sure. Let's go. [Person1]:  Buckle up. [Person2]:  All right. Now what? [Person1]:  Now you put the key in the ignition and start the car. [Person2]:  Which direction should I take? [Person1]:  Make a left on this next street. [Person2]:  Tell me how far to go. [Person1]:  Keep going until I tell you to stop. [Person2]:  Okay, but let me know ahead of time. [Person1]:  That's all for today, so park right there. [Person2]:  That was great. Thanks for taking me driving.
[Person1]:  What can I help you with today? [Person2]:  I have a problem. [Person1]:  What is the problem? [Person2]:  I wrote a check for $ 100 and it bounced. [Person1]:  Do you have enough money in your account? [Person2]:  I think so. [Person1]:  Let me check that for you right now. [Person2]:  Okay. Thank you. [Person1]:  Apparently there is only $ 57 left in your account. [Person2]:  You can't be serious! [Person1]:  That's what my records show. [Person2]:  I see. Thanks for your help.
[Person1]:  Come on, Tara. Let's go up to the window and buy two tickets. The movie is starting in a few minutes. [Person2]:  We can't break into the line. Don't be so impatient. We'll be at the front of the line soon. [Person1]:  Two tickets, please. How much are they? [Person2]:  Oh no, Ari. I didn't mean for you to pay for me when I invited you to go tonight. Let's go Dutch. I'll pay my own way. I insist. [Person1]:  I'm looking forward to this film. I read a good review of it in this morning's newspaper. [Person2]:  Me, too. It will be great to see something light and funny for a change. I'm tired of heavy drama. [Person1]:  Are these seats okay? [Person2]:  They're fine, but I can't watch a movie without popcorn.
[Person1]:  hello! How are you today? [Person2]:  hi. I'm feeling very nervous. I just had a test and I'm not sure how well or how badly I did. [Person1]:  it's not use worrying about it now. you'Ve done test and you can't change any of your answers. [Person2]:  that's true. I really should go home and prepare for the next test, but I'm feeling tired. [Person1]:  let's go and get a coffee together. That will help you to wake up again! [Person2]:  ok. I feel like sitting down and having a chat. How have you been recently? [Person1]:  oh, you know me. I'm always happy! If I think I'm getting into a bad mood, I call some friends and socialize or have a chat. [Person2]:  that's a good idea. I usually just sit at home alone and get increasingly moody. [Person1]:  I hate spending too much time at home. I get bored of it really quickly. I'm always excited about going out to party or other social event and meeting people. [Person2]:  perhaps I'm being too shy. I should go out more too and not spend time worrying about tests!
[Person1]:  What are you going to do for your year abroad, Tim?  [Person2]:  Study study study! I want to learn a lot.  [Person1]:  You're going to take courses?  [Person2]:  Yes, I'm going to take some university courses there.  [Person1]:  Sounds hard.  [Person2]:  Yes, but I think it's probably for the best.  [Person1]:  Won't you get lonely?  [Person2]:  Hey, I'm a pretty cool guy; I'll make friends. And I'll have a lot of extra-curricular activities too. You know, like fencing or theater or something. 
[Person1]:  Hi, I haven't seen you in a while. [Person2]:  Yes, it has been a long time! [Person1]:  How long has it been since we last saw each other? [Person2]:  I think that we last saw each other two years ago. [Person1]:  What have you been doing for the past two years? [Person2]:  I have been going to graduate school at USC. [Person1]:  What are you majoring in? [Person2]:  I am studying international communications. [Person1]:  You should easily be able to find a job with that major. [Person2]:  I am counting on being able to get a good job.
[Person1]:  If you wanna keep healthy, you must give up smoking. It's extremely bad for your health, you know. [Person2]:  I know it's not good for me, but the problem is I just can't help it. [Person1]:  Well, I've got an idea, put the label cancer sticks on each pack of cigarettes, and read it before you smoke. It may give you a feeling to reduce it. [Person2]:  I'll try.
[Person1]:  Mom, I want to get a motorcycle. Is that all right with you? [Person2]:  You mean a murder cycle? Did you know more cyclists die in accidents than motorists? [Person1]:  Mom! I'll wear a helmet and I'll drive sane. I promise. [Person2]:  I'll tell you what. You can get a motorcycle on one condition. [Person1]:  What's that? [Person2]:  You spend two weeks with dad in his ambulance as an EMT trainee and volunteer at the emergency room for one month. [Person1]:  And after that? [Person2]:  After that, we'll let you decide if you still want a murder, I mean motorcycle.
[Person1]:  This is our main service area. We do all the routine services here and have two full-time mechanics. [Person2]:  How often do you service the vans? [Person1]:  They're serviced regularly. We give them a basic service every 10, 000 km or so and a main service once a year, or every 100, 000 km. [Person2]:  I see. What does the service involve? [Person1]:  Well, the same as for private vehicles really, but we do it more often because they get a lot of wear and tear. [Person2]:  Can you carry out major repairs here? [Person1]:  Yes, we've got all the necessary equipment. We can give the engines a major overhaul. If there's a serious problem, we strip down the engine and find the faulty component. Would you like to look around?
[Person1]:  I'll have sole, then. [Person2]:  All right. How about other guests? [Person1]:  The rest of us will have this today's special, please. [Person2]:  OK. [Person1]:  I'm sorry but I ordered sole, not the same as the others. Will you change it? [Person2]:  I'm afraid we have no more sole. [Person1]:  Then, I'll have this pork cute instead. [Person2]:  Certainly. Just a moment, sir.
[Person1]:  Help me organize these coins. [Person2]:  That's a lot of money! What did you do? Break the piggy bank? [Person1]:  Yeah, I'm gonna go to the bank and change it for bills, but first I have to separate them into little piles. [Person2]:  Ok, I'll find all the quarters and dimes while you sort the nickels and pennies. [Person1]:  Great, then we can add everything up and take it to the bank. [Person2]:  I found some coins that are not from here. [Person1]:  Oh yeah, those are from my trip to London. I have a couple of different pence, but in all it won't add up to one pound. [Person2]:  Are you sure the bank will change these coins for you? [Person1]:  Hopefully!
[Person1]:  You look really nice today. [Person2]:  Thank you. I just got this outfit the other day. [Person1]:  Really, where did you get it? [Person2]:  I got it from Macy's. [Person1]:  It's really nice. [Person2]:  Thanks again. You look nice today, too. [Person1]:  Thank you. I just got these shoes today. [Person2]:  Really? What kind of shoes are they? [Person1]:  These are called All Star Chuck Taylors. [Person2]:  I really like those. How much did they cost? [Person1]:  They were about forty dollars. [Person2]:  I think I'm going to go buy myself a pair.
[Person1]:  What time does the train for Boston leave? [Person2]:  9 [Person1]:  When does it arrive? [Person2]:  It should be there at 11 [Person1]:  How much is a one-way ticket? [Person2]:  It's $ 32. 00.
[Person1]:  Sam, can we stop at this bicycle shop? [Person2]:  Do you want to buy a new bicycle? [Person1]:  Yes, and they have a sale on now. [Person2]:  What happened to your old one? [Person1]:  I left it at my parent's house, but I need one here as well. I've been using Jim's old bike but he needs it back. [Person2]:  Let's go then. [Person1]:  Look at this mountain bike. It is only $  330. Do you like it? [Person2]:  I prefer something like this one - a touring bike, but it is more expensive. [Person1]:  How much is it? [Person2]:  The price on the tag says $  565 but maybe you can get a discount. [Person1]:  OK, let's go and ask.
[Person1]:  What can I do for you today? [Person2]:  It's a little embarrassing really ; you see I think I've got a counterfeit note. [Person1]:  Do you remember where you got it? [Person2]:  No, I don't. Usually I'm very careful about checking the money I'm given, but for some reason this one slipped through. [Person1]:  Counterfeit notes these days can be very sophisticated and difficult to spot with the naked eye. But I must warn you that if it does show to be a counterfeit I have no option but to confiscate it. [Person2]:  I understand. To be honest, I'll be glad to get rid of it if it is a fake. [Person1]:  The machine shows it to be counterfeit. You'll need to fill in this form and I'll give you a receipt to show the money has been confiscated.
[Person1]:  Good afternoon, miss, can I help you? [Person2]:  Yes, I'd like to buy this dress, please. [Person1]:  It's certainly a pretty dress. I can ring you up at the register over here. [Person2]:  Great. [Person1]:  Will you be paying by cash, check, or credit card? [Person2]:  I want to use a credit card. Do you take Discover? [Person1]:  Sorry, no. We only take MasterCard or Visa. [Person2]:  I'll put it on my Visa card, then. [Person1]:  Very well, ma'am. Oh, there seems to be a problem, it says it's rejected. [Person2]:  There must be something wrong with the system. Try my MasterCard. [Person1]:  Alright. Thank you. Yes, it seems to be working fine. Your total is $ 199. 00, sign here, please. [Person2]:  Sure. [Person1]:  Here you go, and here's your receipt. Have a nice day. [Person2]:  Thanks. You have a good one, too.
[Person1]:  Excuse me. May I see Mrs. Smith? [Person2]:  It's me. What can I do for you? [Person1]:  Nice to meet you, Mrs. Smith. I'm coming here for an interview by appointment. [Person2]:  Are you Mr. Wu? [Person1]:  Yes, I am. [Person2]:  Nice to meet you, too. Did you have any difficulty finding our company? [Person1]:  Not really, I am familiar with this area.
[Person1]:  Do you know who's just got married? Old McDonald. [Person2]:  Never! He's over 80, isn't he? [Person1]:  He's nearly 90. [Person2]:  Good gracious! Are you sure? [Person1]:  I am. What's more, his wife is 84. [Person2]:  Is she really? [Person1]:  Yes, she is. And guess what, he is her sixth husband. [Person2]:  Really? Quite a woman, isn't she?
[Person1]:  Hey, Peter. I'm sorry. [Person2]:  Hi, Diana. What's wrong? [Person1]:  We were going to Hong Kong this weekend. But I'm afraid I can't go. [Person2]:  How come? [Person1]:  I have a really big geography test and I have to study for it. [Person2]:  We can go next weekend instead? [Person1]:  No, I don't want to ruin your weekend. You go ahead and please take the book I bought to my friend Sally. Tell her I have to study all weekend, because I can't afford to fail the test. [Person2]:  OK, then I'll go with them. But it's a pity you can't come.
[Person1]:  Hi. Welcome to Parent-Teacher Conference. [Person2]:  Thanks. [Person1]:  So, what is your child's name? [Person2]:  It's Megan Jones. [Person1]:  Megan. Uh, let's see. Oh yeah, Megan. Um, she missed the last couple of days. Has she been sick? [Person2]:  No, she's been having some problems with the other kids in your class, and ... [Person1]:  Well, you know, junior high school is a difficult time, but she just needs to speak up a little more in class. I think ... [Person2]:  No, it's ... it's more than that. Some of the kids in your class have really been bullying her a lot. [Person1]:  What do you mean? [Person2]:  Well, um, they've been teasing her a lot about her appearance, and then, the other day, you didn't help things [ What? ] Yeah, she said you made a comment about her clothes. [Person1]:  What do you mean? I mean ... [Person2]:  She said you commented on her shirt and jeans, like they were from the 1970s or something like that. [Person1]:  Well I was just kind of joking a little bit with her. [Person2]:  Well, yeah, that's what you think, but other kids follow your example. In fact, one of the kids took a picture of her with their phone and posted it and had some real nasty comments on Facebook. It was terrible. [Person1]:  Well, you know, kids can be kids. [Person2]:  No, don't you get it? This is bullying; it's cyberbullying, and adults like you are part of the problem. Forget it. I'm planning on discussing this with the principal tomorrow. [Person1]:  Oh, wait, wait, wait. Um, uh, oh. I'm sorry if I hurt her feelings [ Yeah. You did! ], but ... [Person2]:  I get sick and tired of people thinking that a little teasing is okay. Too many kids are killing themselves because they feel that there's just no way to escape this. [Person1]:  Okay. Well, I guess I need to be a little bit more careful, but ... [Person2]:  Yeah, you do. I really hope I can get Megan to come to school tomorrow. She's been really, really anxious and depressed [ Wow. ] for some time, and your comments and those that the other kids made haven't helped. [Person1]:  Wow. Uh, I'm really sorry. Could you see if you can bring her to school tomorrow? Uh, I'd like to apologize and see what I can do to, maybe, improve the situation. [Person2]:  Thanks. I'd appreciate it. That would help.
[Person1]:  I'm calling about your ad in today's paper for a secretary. Is the positions still available? [Person2]:  Yes, it is. [Person1]:  I'd like to apply. [Person2]:  Do you have any experience? [Person1]:  Yes, I do. [Person2]:  And can you type 60 words per minute? [Person1]:  Yes, I can. May I request an interview? [Person2]:  Yes. What's your name? [Person1]:  Peter Smith. [Person2]:  Is two o'clock Friday afternoon convenient for you? [Person1]:  Two o'clock is fine. Thank you very much.
[Person1]:  Parcel Express, good morning! How can I help you? [Person2]:  Good morning. I'm thinking of sending a parcel to New York next week. Can you tell me what the procedure is, please? [Person1]:  Certainly. When you ring us, we need the following information. The invoice address [Person2]:  Just a moment. I'm taking notes. Phone number, right. [Person1]:  Then we need the full name, address and phone number of the person you are sending the parcel to. [Person2]:  Ok, anything else? [Person1]:  Yes, the weight and dimensions of the parcel. That's height, weight and length. And the value of the goods and full description. [Person2]:  Value, description. [Person1]:  Yes, but don't seal the parcel. You need to leave it open so that the driver can check the contents when he collects it. After the recent bombing, the airline said that we'd have to check all parcels. They told us we had to do it. [Person2]:  Fine. Now last question. How long will the parcel take to get to New York? [Person1]:  One to two working days. There are daily flights at midday. And if we collect the parcel from you at 10 [Person2]:  Right. Thank you very much. You've been very helpful. [Person1]:  Not at all. Goodbye. [Person2]:  Goodbye.
[Person1]:  Stan, you've already finished your essay? I've been working on mine for two weeks, and I'll need another week before it's finished. [Person2]:  I know, Jenny, it's a huge project - researching. thinking of an argument and then finding details that show the argument is true. [Person1]:  That part only took me one week. But writing and rewriting,and then deleting and writing again ...that's killing me! [Person2]:  That part didn't bother me. [Person1]:  What's your secret? [Person2]:  I write an outline [Person1]:  That sounds hard. [Person2]:  It's easier than you think, and when it's time to write, everything goes really smoothly. I have an outline from last semester that I could show you, if you're interested.
[Person1]:  You are early today! Did you drive here? [Person2]:  That's my last choice. Driving a car in rush hour is obviously not a good idea. [Person1]:  So you took a bus? [Person2]:  No, the subway instead. I found it the easiest and cheapest way for me to get to the office.
[Person1]:  You're going to make a trip to San Francisco, aren't you? [Person2]:  Yes. But I haven't got the plane ticket yet. I'm thinking of postponing the trip to next month since this is the busiest month for the airlines.
[Person1]:  Good morning. What can I do for you? [Person2]:  I am looking for a flat for 2 people near the university. [Person1]:  Well. There are several places available and the rent ranges from 80 to $150 a month. What are your requirements? [Person2]:  I think of flat for no more than $100 a month is good. I prefer to live in a quiet street and I need at least 2 bedrooms. [Person1]:  Well, we have got 2 flats that meet your requirements. This one costs $85 a month, it's 2 miles away from the university. [Person2]:  Well. That's a little far to walk. What about the other one? [Person1]:  The second one is 3/2 miles away from the university, but it is smaller and more expensive. It's $100 a month. [Person2]:  Can we go to have a look at the second one now? I want to examine the room before making a final decision. [Person1]:  No problem, but please wait for 5 minutes. I need to finish typing this piece of material. [Person2]:  OK.
[Person1]:  John, I'm sorry, the air tickets for the International Day are sold out. [Person2]:  Really? I didn't expect that. [Person1]:  It's possible because everyone wants to travel during the holiday weekend. [Person2]:  I should have booked the tickets in advance. [Person1]:  Take it easy. I'll like you know if anyone decides to cancel his reservation.
[Person1]:  I was wondering if you could help me with something. [Person2]:  Sure, anything you say. [Person1]:  Actually, it ' s a little bit silly. [Person2]:  Don ' t worry about it, just ask. [Person1]:  What words do I need to know to buy a pair of shoes? [Person2]:  You need to know the type of shoes you want. [Person1]:  Don ' t worry about that. I can point it out in the store. [Person2]:  The shoes can be comfortable or not comfortable, too wide, too narrow, or just right ; and long or short. In girls shoes, the heel can be high or low. [Person1]:  Let me write all that down. I ' m going shopping this afternoon.
[Person1]:  I understand we will need seven air conditioning units on the two floors. That's what you think, yes? [Person2]:  Yes. You could use five or six units. But five or six wouldn't be very efficient. I recommend seven. [Person1]:  And if we take the Decker units you suggested, what would the price be? [Person2]:  Let me calculate the price for you. I can give you a 15 % discount if you buy the seven units. Let's see here. Your total would be 5929 dollars. [Person1]:  Isn't there any way we can get central air conditioning in this building? [Person2]:  As I said, it is possible, but it would be much more expensive. I think it would be at least 12000 dollars to do a complete system. [Person1]:  That's too much. We need to use the separate units, I guess. [Person2]:  It's more practical, and the new units really are very quiet. Your customers won't even notice them. [Person1]:  So you say we can do it for 6000 dollars. [Person2]:  Yes, that's for the units. Installation would probably be another 700 to 1000 dollars. But it depends on the time spent, of course. [Person1]:  You mean installation isn't included? I'm very surprised. [Person2]:  No, Ma'am. Installation isn't included. The price I quoted was just for the units. [Person1]:  In Taipei, you know, the company usually installs the things they sell. They don't charge extra. [Person2]:  I know that, Ma'am. But they would just raise the price of the units to cover their costs. Here in L. A. , installation is charged separately. [Person1]:  Yes, I suppose I should get used to it. But I'm not really willing to spend more than 6000 dollars for this. We haven't even opened yet. [Person2]:  I understand, Ma'am. [Person1]:  And the other company that gave me a quote on this said they could do it for 4000 dollars. [Person2]:  It's a question of quality, Ma'am. At that price, you would not get good equipment. I've been in this business for almost twenty years. I know what happens. If you don't get quality air conditioning now, you will just have to replace the system after two years. [Person1]:  I will tell you what I can agree to. If you can quote me a price of 6000 dollars, installation included, I can accept. [Person2]:  Well. [Person1]:  You do seem like a better company than the other one. So I am willing to pay more than 4000 for you. But I won't pay more than 6000. [Person2]:  Well, we don't usually do it, but. . . I believe we can accommodate you on this. We will do the installation for free. Because we appreciate your business. [Person1]:  Good. I hope we can arrange the contract as soon as possible.
[Person1]:  Did you watch the Premiership last night? [Person2]:  Yes, I watched United play Chelsea. What a fierce battle! allay were engaged in intensive pressing and tackling in midfield. Well, it was not like a normal English League match. [Person1]:  No, it wasn't. Rather, it looked like a Bundesliga match, where physical contact is so frequent. English League teams are apt to pass the midfield quickly with long passes. It seems to me English soccer players are very gentlemanly. As Diego Maradona spoke teasingly, they often knew only chasing hard after the ball, but forgot to steal it. [Person2]:  Haha. That's probably why slide tackle and fouls are less common, and offsides more frequent in English League matches than those on the Continent. And the ball is often kept flying overhead, drawing beautiful curves in the sky. Such games are quite pleasing to the eye. [Person1]:  Which team do you back then? [Person2]:  I'm a firm United supporter. I like their playing style. The Reds always have several excellent wing-backs, Like Riggs, Peckham and Gary Neville. They often make wonderful crosses when they assist in attacking. [Person1]:  But the Reds keep a weak midfield. I think Juventas of Italian Series A have always maintained a very formidable midfield. It is the main source of its strength.
[Person1]:  Please make yourselves at home. Let me take your coats. Dinner is almost ready. I hope you brought your appetite  [Person2]:  Your house is lovely, Armand! Very interesting decor. . . very. . . Gothic.  [Person3]:  I think it's amazing! You have such good taste, Armand. I'm thinking of re-decorating my house. maybe you could give me a few pointers?  [Person1]:  It would be my pleasure. Please have a seat. Can I offer you a glass of wine?  [Person3]:  We would love some!  [Person1]:  Here you are. A very special merlot brought directly from my home country. It has a unique ingredient which gives it a pleasant aroma and superior flavor  [Person3]:  Mmm. . . it's delicious!  [Person2]:  It's a bit bitter for my taste. . . almost tastes like. . . like. . .  [Person3]:  Ellen! Ellen! Are you okay?  [Person1]:  Did she pass out?  [Person3]:  Yeah. . .  [Person1]:  I hope that you didn't poison her drink too much! You'll ruin our meal! 
[Person1]:  What's going on? [Person2]:  Nothing really. How about you? [Person1]:  A lot, like the party I'm having on Friday. [Person2]:  Well, that's cool. [Person1]:  Will you be able to make it? [Person2]:  I'm busy this Friday. I'm sorry. [Person1]:  What do you have to do? [Person2]:  I'm having dinner with my family [Person1]:  Maybe you can come next time. [Person2]:  I'll make sure and come to your next party. [Person1]:  I'll look for you at my next party. [Person2]:  I'll be there.
[Person1]:  This looks like a nice restaurant. [Person2]:  Yeah, it is. I come here all the time. [Person1]:  Let's sit over there. [Person2]:  OK. [Person1]:  Can you pass me a menu please. [Person2]:  Sure. What are you going to have to drink? [Person1]:  I'm going to have a glass of beer. How about you? [Person2]:  I think I'll have a glass of wine. [Person1]:  Do you want to order an appetizer first? [Person2]:  Not really, maybe we can just order some bread. [Person1]:  OK. What are you going to have to eat? [Person2]:  I'm not sure. I haven't decided yet. Can you recommend something? [Person1]:  Sure, I've had the steak and the lobster before. They're both very good. [Person2]:  I think I'll have the lobster. What are you going to have? [Person1]:  I'm not that hungry. I think I'm just going to have a salad. [Person2]:  I'm gonna go to the bathroom. When the waitress comes back, will you order for me? [Person1]:  Sure. No problem.
[Person1]:  My doctor says that I need a blood test. [Person2]:  I can help you with that. Just have a seat and roll up your left sleeve. [Person1]:  What are you taking my blood for? [Person2]:  Your doctor has requested a check of your white blood count. [Person1]:  What information does that give him? [Person2]:  If your white blood cell count is off, it could signal an infection somewhere in your body. [Person1]:  Is a blood test painful? [Person2]:  I am putting a tourniquet on your arm to plump up the vein. It will only feel like a little pin prick. [Person1]:  Oh, my God, that hurts! [Person2]:  That was it! Thank you for coming in today.
[Person1]:  Is there anything I can do for you? [Person2]:  Yes, we would like to take a tour to L. A. [Person1]:  Well, that's really a big city. How long do your vacations last? [Person2]:  2 weeks. Can I have a brochure of the sightseeing tours? [Person1]:  Here you are. Take your time.
[Person1]:  Mmm. . . it is delicious. [Person2]:  Oh, do you really like it? [Person1]:  Yes. It's superb. [Person2]:  Well, it's kind of you to say so. [Person1]:  In fact, could I ask you for the recipe? [Person2]:  Sure. It's really very easy. First, mix together an egg, two teaspoons of salt, and two pounds of ground beef. Then, add two ounces of milk. Are you with me? [Person1]:  Yes, I've got it. [Person2]:  OK. Next, put the mixture into a baking pan and bake it forty-five minutes at 360 degrees. [Person1]:  Wait a minute. I didn't catch you there. Could you repeat that? [Person2]:  Sure. Bake it forty-five minutes at 360 degrees. [Person1]:  Now, I've got it. Thank you.
[Person1]:  Jacob, are you interested in helping me out and going on a blind date with a friend of mine? [Person2]:  That depends. What does she look like? [Person1]:  Well, she's got a beautiful face and long curly red hair. [Person2]:  How tall is she? [Person1]:  She's fairly tall, maybe 2 inches taller than me. [Person2]:  Is she chubby? [Person1]:  Not at all. She's actually very athletic. [Person2]:  It sounds like she's pretty good-looking. Does she wear glasses? [Person1]:  No, but she does wear contact lenses. [Person2]:  How's her skin? [Person1]:  She's got a gorgeous complexion with a few freckles on her nose. [Person2]:  Does she have any piercings or tattoos? [Person1]:  I think she has her ears pierced and she definitely has a few tattoos [Person2]:  What's the tattoo on her foot like? [Person1]:  It's a butterfly - everyone in her family has one. [Person2]:  Even her mom? [Person1]:  Yes, even her mom. [Person2]:  What's her personality like? [Person1]:  She's a lot like me. [Person2]:  So there is something wrong with her! It was beginning to sound like she was too good to be true!
[Person1]:  I can't believe you got such great seats to this baseball game! [Person2]:  I'm glad you like them. [Person1]:  We are right by home plate. I can see everything perfectly. [Person2]:  I almost got seats by first base, but I thought you would like these more.
[Person1]:  Where are you going for your holiday this year, Jane? [Person2]:  Florida. [Person1]:  Great! How long are you going to stay there? [Person2]:  One week. Just for Christmas time. [Person1]:  Have you got any friends there? [Person2]:  No. I have always wanted to go, but I've been too busy. Now I've got a week's holiday, and I can enjoy Christmas special prices. My dream will come true. [Person1]:  Lovely! I guess you will certainly go to Disneyland. [Person2]:  You are right. You have been there, haven't you? [Person1]:  Yes, but just a couple of days. [Person2]:  Tell me something about it, will you? [Person1]:  There are so many things to see in the park. It has several main sections. They are named Main Street, Frontier Land, Fantasy Land, Tomorrow Land and Adventure Land. The park is often called a 'Magic Kingdom'. [Person2]:  It must be an unforgettable experience for you. [Person1]:  That's true, especially the Magic Mountain and Fantasy Land. I'm sure you'll enjoy your visit too. [Person2]:  Thank you. I believe so.
[Person1]:  Hello. Is that reception? [Person2]:  Yes, madam. [Person1]:  This is Mrs. Bates, Room 504. I sent some clothes to the laundry this morning. But they are not back yet. You see, we are leaving early tomorrow morning. [Person2]:  Just a moment, madam. I'll put you through to the housekeeper.
[Person1]:  What do you think of the novel you just finished reading?  [Person2]:  I like it a lot. It has a very funny beginning, I think. It attracts your attention the moment you begin reading it.  [Person1]:  What do you like best about it?  [Person2]:  I like the plot. It's so full of twists and turns. I also like the main character. She is so humorous and smart.  [Person1]:  What do you think of the ending?  [Person2]:  The ending is a bit weak. It's so abrupt, like those of most other detective stories. 
[Person1]:  Three other people started to bid. One called himself Buddhabuyer, so I knew he meant business. I raised my bid twice, but it kept going up.  [Person2]:  How high did the price go?  [Person1]:  I don't know. I dropped out at $250.  [Person2]:  You didn't watch the end of the auction?  [Person1]:  No. It wasn't the super bargain I thought it was. 
[Person1]:  Oh, no. This can't be happening. [Person2]:  I wonder what's going on. [Person1]:  I'm going to ring the alarm. I told them weeks ago to check it. I would have been better off taking the stairs. [Person2]:  Do you mean this has happened before? [Person1]:  Yeah, it was a few weeks ago but I wasn't in here. Oh, if I'm in here a long time I don't know what I'm going to do. [Person2]:  Well, for crying out loud. Don't lose your head. Calm down. [Person1]:  You know I knocked myself out to be on time for an appointment. And now look. [Person2]:  Complaining isn't going to help. [Person1]:  How can you be so calm? Has this ever happened to you? [Person2]:  No. This is my first time but why should I panic? What good would it do? I'd rather pass the time in here pleasantly. [Person1]:  How can that be possible? [Person2]:  Well, we could use our phones to listen to music, read e-books or, hey, why don't you just sit down and tell me about yourself? [Person1]:  OK.
[Person1]:  So, Misaki, you're from Japan, right? [Person2]:  Yes, I'm from Akita, the northern Japan. [Person1]:  What is it like? [Person2]:  There are a lot of mountains. And you can actually see colors changing on them in the fall. [Person1]:  Sounds beautiful. [Person2]:  Yeah, in my home, Yashima town, there are only 6,000 people. But there is an amazing waterfall which I consider to be the best in Japan, really tall and wide. [Person1]:  Cool. So when is the last time you went home? [Person2]:  7 days ago. My parents still live there.
[Person1]:  Hello, ma ' am. Can I help you? [Person2]:  I ' m looking for a sweater. [Person1]:  What size are you looking for? [Person2]:  Well, I ' m looking for size 10 but you don ' t have it. [Person1]:  How about this one? I think it looks terrific on you. [Person2]:  Yes, I like the color. Can I try it on? [Person1]:  Sure. The fitting room is on your right. [Person2]:  It fits well. I like it a lot. What do you think? [Person1]:  You look pretty in red. [Person2]:  Oh, it ' s my favorite. How much is it? [Person1]:  $ 29.99. [Person2]:  Okay. I ' ll take it. Thank you very much for your help. [Person1]:  You ' re welcome.
[Person1]:  What's wrong with it? [Person2]:  It's broken. I just bought it yesterday, you know, it costs me $ 556. [Person1]:  It sounds too bad. What will you do? [Person2]:  Mike suggests me to return it. [Person1]:  That's what I want to say.
[Person1]:  Oh, dear! which dress should I choose? I can't make up my mind. Please help me. [Person2]:  You know I don't know anything about fashion. [Person1]:  Which dress do you like best? [Person2]:  Well, they are both all right. [Person1]:  Only all right? [Person2]:  Oh, no. I mean you look very nice in both of them. [Person1]:  Mike, that's no help to me at all. I can't wear both of them at the same time. I want a decision. [Person2]:  But after all, it is your decision, not mine. [Person1]:  Oh, yes. The green dress is very smart. but I can't be sure if it goes with a hat.
[Person1]:  Good afternoon, can I help you? [Person2]:  Hello. I've been told to come in and see someone about my L / C. I just had a message to come in and see someone called Kristy. [Person1]:  I'm Kristy. Can I help? [Person2]:  I received a letter asking me to come in and see you. I'm Mr. Simons from Dalton's Electrics. [Person1]:  Oh, yes. Hello Mr. Simons. I have some information about your L / C amendment. The negotiating bank has just informed us that the 3rd party does not wish to accept the amendment. [Person2]:  Oh dear! Where should I go from here? [Person1]:  I'd recommend going back to the 3rd party, personally this time, and discussing what exactly it is they aren't happy with. Hopefully you can reach some sort of agreement, which is viable for everyone.
[Person1]:  How's your father? [Person2]:  He's fine. He retired last week. It's turning point in his life. Now he can relax and enjoy his retirement. [Person1]:  He can spend more time with his grandchildren. [Person2]:  Oh, I don't think he wants to. He wants to travel to several different countries around the world. [Person1]:  So, he wants to have a more active retirement. Good idea! [Person2]:  How do you want to spend your old age? [Person1]:  In the same way, probably.
[Person1]:  Hi, boss. You wanted to see me? [Person2]:  Zina. Look, I know when I hired you, I told you I'd pay you a salary. But I just can't. [Person1]:  Excuse me? I hope I didn't just hear what I think I just heard. [Person2]:  I know it's awkward, but you're going to be thanking me later. I'm going to make you rich. [Person1]:  You're going to make me rich by not paying me?
[Person1]:  May I help you? [Person2]:  Yes, I would like to check in. [Person1]:  Do you have a reservation? [Person2]:  Yes, my name is Carol Tiang. That's spelled J - I - A - N - G. [Person1]:  I'm sorry, Ma'am. I can't find anything under that name. Do you have your confirmation number? [Person2]:  No, I don't have it with me. But I know I have a reservation. My husband made it for me last month. [Person1]:  Well, let me look again. How do you spell your first name, Ma'am? [Person2]:  C - A - R - O - L. Carol. [Person1]:  I don't find a Carol in the computer for today. I have a Carol Larson here. But that reservation is for next Monday. [Person2]:  No, that's not me. My name is Tiang, not Larson. My husband reserved for me. [Person1]:  Are you sure he used your name, Ma'am? Maybe he reserved under his name. [Person2]:  His name is Lin, L - I - N. [Person1]:  I'm sorry. I have nothing here. [Person2]:  Miss, I know he made this reservation for me.
[Person1]:  Who was the best teacher that you ever had? [Person2]:  That would have to be Miss Baymler, my fourth grade teacher. [Person1]:  What was she like? [Person2]:  She was patient, kind, fun, smart, caring, and yet strict, too. I really learned a lot from her. [Person1]:  What kind of things did you learn? [Person2]:  She taught us that you can do anything that you want to do. [Person1]:  Anything? Do you really believe that we can do anything? [Person2]:  If you really want to do something and you work hard at it, I believe you can do it. [Person1]:  You said she was strict. Did she have a lot of rules? [Person2]:  She had some rules that helped us to feel comfortable. For example, the students had to treat each other with respect, or they would be disciplined. [Person1]:  I see. She sounds like she really cared about her students. [Person2]:  Yes. She treated us all fairly. She don't have any teacher's pets. [Person1]:  Really? Doesn't every teacher have a teacher's pet? [Person2]:  Well. To be honest, I usually sucked up to teachers because I wanted them to give me good grades. However, Miss Baymler didn't treat me any differently. She really didn't have any teacher's pets. [Person1]:  Do you know what she is doing now? [Person2]:  As a matter of fact, I do. After she taught our class, she got married and moved to another city. Then, she started writing children's book. [Person1]:  Have you ever read one of the books? [Person2]:  Of course! Both children and adults enjoy her books. [Person1]:  Why don't you recommend one to me? [Person2]:  ok! I'll bring one to you next time.
[Person1]:  I have a problem with my credit card. [Person2]:  What's wrong with it? [Person1]:  There is a charge on my card that I didn't make. [Person2]:  Can you tell me what the charge was? [Person1]:  It's for a purse that cost $ 350. [Person2]:  Are you positive that you didn't buy the purse? [Person1]:  I can't even afford a purse that expensive. [Person2]:  I'm very sorry. When was this purchase made? [Person1]:  I was at work, but the purchase was made at 3 [Person2]:  We're going to investigate this claim. [Person1]:  OK. Do I have to pay for this charge? [Person2]:  You won't have to pay for anything.
[Person1]:  How are things with you? [Person2]:  I'm fine. Thank you. [Person1]:  How may I help you? [Person2]:  I need to make a deposit. [Person1]:  Will you be depositing cash or a check? [Person2]:  I will be depositing cash. [Person1]:  How much would you like to deposit? [Person2]:  It's going to be $ 300. [Person1]:  What account would you like to deposit that into? [Person2]:  Could you deposit that into my account for stocks, please? [Person1]:  Can I do anything else for you today? [Person2]:  That'll be all. Thank you very much.
[Person1]:  We're supposed to check in at the air-china's counter. Thirty minutes before take off, Joe. [Person2]:  Yes, I know. The boarding time on the ticket says 17 o'clock.' [Person1]:  Do we need to show our ID cards when checking in. [Person2]:  Yes, It's essential. [Person1]:  What about our luggage? [Person2]:  We can check it and hand carry small bags. And we have open each for inspection [Person1]:  Are they going to frisk all the passengers? [Person2]:  I think so. we certainly don't want a highjack to happen on our plane today.
[Person1]:  Dad, what will we have for dinner? [Person2]:  I don't know. Maybe fried fish, chicken soup and... [Person1]:  Oh, no, I'm tired of such things now. [Person2]:  I'm sorry. But that is the only thing I can cook. What do you want to have then? [Person1]:  I do wish Mom were at home. Why don't we go and eat out for a change? [Person2]:  Oh, that's a good idea. I like Kentucky fried chicken very much. [Person1]:  Dad, you always talk about fried chicken. Let's have something different. I'd like to go to McDonald's this time. [Person2]:  OK then. You'll drive, won't you? [Person1]:  No, I'm a bit tired today. You should drive. [Person2]:  OK, OK. I always do things like that. I hope your Mom will be back soon. Ah here we are.

[Person2]:  Hamburger, salad, and a glass of Coke. Is that all for you, Jill? [Person1]:  Right, and give me an ice cream, too. I'll go and find the seats. [Person2]:  And I'll get some vegetables for myself, and a coffee...
[Person1]:  Hey, I'm a little bit upset about that television you people sold me. I got it home and the thing doesn't work! The lines.., the... there're lines all over the picture! I'm just not satisfied. I'd like to have my money back, or give me a new television. [Person2]:  Well, it's not my fault! What did you do with it when you got it home? [Person1]:  I just plugged it in and turned it on. [Person2]:  Well, it was working fine when you took it... when you left here. [Person1]:  Well, I think the least you people can do is to come over and adjust it for me, and make sure the thing's working all right. [Person2]:  Well, I wouldn't mind doing that. Or you could bring it here and I'll have a look at it. But you bought a second-hand TV and there's only a... two-day warranty on it. [Person1]:  Second-hand? Second-hand?! That thing was supposed to be new! Your salesman told me it was brand new. [Person2]:  Well, I can't be responsible for that.
[Person1]:  Hello. Is this Ann?  [Person2]:  Yes, it is. Kelly?  [Person1]:  Yes, it's me.  [Person2]:  Do you have a cold?  [Person1]:  No. Worse than that. I have a flu. I'm in bed with a fever.  [Person2]:  Oh, no! What about your presentation today?  [Person1]:  I'd like to do it, of course. But I just can't. I'm afraid I'd fall down in the middle of it.  [Person2]:  I understand. What should I tell Mr. Morley?  [Person1]:  Why not just tell him I'm sick? I'll ring him myself this afternoon.  [Person2]:  Alright. Have you been to see a doctor?  [Person1]:  Not yet. I feel too lousy to go out. Anyway, I have a flu. I know what it is. I don't need a doctor to tell me that.  [Person2]:  Do you think you'll be able to come in tomorrow? Or should I call off your appointments for tomorrow too?  [Person1]:  I'm not sure yet. Maybe this will all be gone in a day. So it's probably better if you don't call off my appointments. I will call you later this afternoon and tell you what I think.  [Person2]:  It's rainy weather today. Maybe it's better if you just stay inside. Make yourself some chicken soup and sleep.  [Person1]:  Yes, that's what I plan to do. Except I won't make the chicken soup. Right now I don't think I could swallow more than a spoonful of it.  [Person2]:  That bad, huh?  [Person1]:  Yeah, I'm very nauseous. It's mostly nausea and a fever.  [Person2]:  Well, I'll cancel your appointments for today. And I'll tell Mr. Morley.  [Person1]:  Thanks, Ann. Talk to you this afternoon.  [Person2]:  Hope you feel better. 
[Person1]:  Good morning. Mrs. Smith.  [Person2]:  Good morning! Can you help me, please? I'm looking for some books for my mother.  [Person1]:  Well, what kind of books does she like?  [Person2]:  She's very fond of detective stories?  [Person1]:  I see. Has she read any detective stories?  [Person2]:  Oh, yes!  [Person1]:  Do you know if she's read this one?

There are a lot of people there.  [Person1]:  Good luck with that.  [Person2]:  Thanks.

[Person2]:  No I haven't. I haven't visited the Bund either. I've always had too much work to do.  [Person1]:  So you haven't done much then, in Shanghai?  [Person2]:  Actually, I've eaten soup dumplings in a lovely restaurant on Nanjing Lu. They were delicious!

[Person2]:  What do you do? [Person1]:  I work for a travel agency. Working in a restaurant was just too boring. [Person2]:  Your new job sounds interesting. Have you got time for a coffee? So we could catch up. [Person1]:  Sure, why not? [Person2]:  Oh, there's a nice cafe about 2 minutes from here. [Person1]:  Let's go then.
[Person1]:  Hello! [Person2]:  Hello, Is that Stefan? [Person1]:  I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you've dialed the wrong number. There is no Stefan here. [Person2]:  Really? Are you sure? I called before and he was there. [Person1]:  Yes. I'm sure. You have the wrong number. I have used this number for more than 20 years. [Person2]:  That can't be true. I remember the number clearly. Is your number 1199886? [Person1]:  No, it isn't. It's 1199866. It seems that you have misdialed. [Person2]:  Oh, I'm sorry I bothered you. I'm really sorry. [Person1]:  It doesn't matter. It happens to everyone. [Person2]:  Sorry again for bothering you. [Person1]:  That's all right.

[Person1]:  No, I was invited to give a talk in my school. [Person2]:  So how much did you pay for it? [Person1]:  I pay just $70 for it. I saved $30. [Person2]:  That's really a bargain. [Person1]:  You're right. Well, what did you do while I was out shopping? [Person2]:  I watched TV for a while and then I did some reading. It wasn't a very interesting book so I just read a few pages. Then I took a shower. [Person1]:  I thought you said you were going to see Mike. [Person2]:  I'll go and visit him at his home tomorrow. He'll return home tomorrow morning. [Person1]:  I'm glad he can finally returned home after that accident.

[Person1]:  Who do you work for at the moment, Ms. Mann? [Person2]:  Um, I work for the BBC World Service. [Person1]:  Ah, and how long have you worked for the BBC? [Person2]:  I've been with the BBC for five years. Yes, exactly five years. [Person1]:  And how long have you been their German correspondent? [Person2]:  For two years. [Person1]:  And what did you do before the BBC? [Person2]:  I worked as an interpreter for the EU. [Person1]:  As you know, this job is based in Geneva. Have you ever lived abroad before? [Person2]:  Oh yes, I have. [Person1]:  And when did you live abroad? [Person2]:  Well, in fact, I was born in Argentina and I lived there until I was eleven. Also, I lived and worked in Brussels for two years when I was working for the EU. [Person1]:  Mmm... That's interesting. Have you travelled much? [Person2]:  Oh yes, indeed. I've travelled all over western and eastern Europe, and I've also been to many parts of South America. [Person1]:  Mmm... And why did you go to these places? [Person2]:  Well, mostly for pleasure, but three years ago I went back to Argentina to cover various political stories for the BBC.
[Person1]:  Tell me, Jack. Do you look through the Web much? [Person2]:  Well, to tell the truth, I'm so busy with my work. I don't really have much time to surf the Web. Let me think...I suppose I log on a couple of times a week, for about two or three hours at a time. [Person1]:  So, what do you do on the Internet when you log on? [Person2]:  Well, sometimes I look up information I need for my job. It saves a lot of time looking through books in the library. [Person1]:  Yes, it sure does.
[Person1]:  Clara! How are you? I haven't heard from you for at least three years. What are you doing? [Person2]:  I came back from Australia. Now I've opened a company. I heard from Miss Sue that you are getting married. Congratulations! [Person1]:  Thank you! [Person2]:  Why did you keep so quiet about it? [Person1]:  I'm sorry. I mean to tell you. But I couldn't find you by your previous address. [Person2]:  When will the wedding be? [Person1]:  January 1st. [Person2]:  I want to give you a present. What would you like? [Person1]:  Let me see. Oh, a bunch of flowers will do. [Person2]:  I see. Bye. [Person1]:  Bye.
[Person1]:  What can I do for you?  [Person2]:  I am trying to find this book.  [Person1]:  What's the problem?  [Person2]:  It doesn't seem like this library has it.  [Person1]:  Have you checked the computer?  [Person2]:  I have already.  [Person1]:  What did it say?  [Person2]:  It says the book is on the shelf, but I didn't find it there.  [Person1]:  I can always borrow the book from another library.  [Person2]:  You can do that?  [Person1]:  I'll make the call and contact you when it gets in.  [Person2]:  That's fantastic. Thank you. 
[Person1]:  I'm tired. I went to sleep late last night. [Person2]:  Did you work overtime again? [Person1]:  No, I watched that new reality TV show till midnight. [Person2]:  Oh, you didn't watch that rubbish, did you? It's just a group of people stuck in a house doing nothing. I have to admit it was attractive when it was new. But it's strange to think people are still watching the same shows nowadays. It seems to me that those shows just feed the big desire everyone seems to have for media attention. Everyone wants to be a star these days. [Person1]:  But there are still some people signing up for those shows just to experience a different life or to earn some money. [Person2]:  Anyway, I have no interest in these nobodies, whose idea of fame is that they were on a reality TV show. I admire people with real talent do actually earn their fame because they are different from the rest of us. [Person1]:  Uhm, I don't think so in that way. Maybe we need to rethink what fame is.
[Person1]:  Good morning, Susan. Did you sleep well last night? [Person2]:  I fell asleep right away, didn't wake up once and didn't have any bad dreams. [Person1]:  Great! You look much more relaxed today. [Person2]:  Much better. But I'm still worried about something. [Person1]:  What's that? [Person2]:  Well, I have to drive to school for a meeting this morning and I'm afraid I may get stuck in the rush hour traffic, and I will be pretty upset. [Person1]:  Don't worry! Just breathe deeply when that happens. [Person2]:  OK, I'll try that. [Person1]:  Is there anything else bothering you? [Person2]:  Just one more thing. A school called me this morning to see if I could teach a few classes this weekend. But I'm supposed to work on a paper that's due on Monday. [Person1]:  Try not to take on more than you can handle. [Person2]:  You're right. I'll probably focus on my paper. Thanks.
[Person1]:  Did you have your own room when you were little Jack? [Person2]:  No, I think for the first 17 years of my life. I always had somebody else in the room with me. [Person1]:  I always wanted my own room you know, because there were 5 kids in our family and we had to share rooms.I had my own room for the first time when I was about 15. [Person2]:  When I had my own room for the first time in my life, I felt very proud and wrote in my diary. I will treasure this new freedom. [Person1]:  Well, many of my friends had their own rooms even when they were young, even as babies. I was so jealous. But there were only 3 bedrooms in our house for 7 people so it was really crowded.
[Person1]:  It gives me great pleasure to introduce Mr. . . eh Mr. . . [Person2]:  Miss! [Person1]:  Yeah! May I introduce Mis. . . eh. . . Miss. . . [Person2]:  My name is Jane Brown! [Person1]:  Oh yeah! Would you please welcome. . . Miss Jan Brown.
[Person1]:  Hi, sir. Come and have a look here. We have all kinds of sweaters. [Person2]:  I'm looking for a sweater for my wife. Tomorrow is her birthday. And I know she needs a woolen sweater. [Person1]:  How do you like this grey one? It's pure wool, one hundred percent of Xinjiang wool. [Person2]:  It feels good. Are there cowl-neck pullovers with the same color? My wife prefers a turtleneck to a V-shaped collar. [Person1]:  Yes, we do. What size do you want? [Person2]:  Size one. By the way, what if I bring home this sweater and my wife doesn't like it? [Person1]:  Well, you can always bring it back to us for a full refund. [Person2]:  All right. Could I have it gift-wrapped, please? [Person1]:  Yes, just a moment, please.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, is this the right counter for express mail? [Person2]:  Yes, it is. What can I do for you? [Person1]:  I want to send some important documents to Canada for my postgraduate admission. [Person2]:  Are they urgent, please? [Person1]:  Yes, the deadline for applying is 1st Feb, so I hope they will arrive in 3 days. [Person2]:  Well, DHL is famous for its speed and reliability. It is the fastest international postal service available. The document will arrive in two or three days. [Person1]:  Really? But can you guarantee the safety? [Person2]:  Yes, I promise. Your document won't be broken or lost. All the items are handled by special staff and carried by a courier. It is reliable. [Person1]:  OK. I will send them now.

[Person2]:  This is your receipt which you have to keep until the remittee receives the express. You can also check your post on our web. The post number is on the top of the receipt. [Person1]:  Thank you. I have got quite clear idea of it.
[Person1]:  I need to pay the fine on my ticket. [Person2]:  Do you have the ticket with you? [Person1]:  Yes, I have my ticket with me. [Person2]:  Let me see your ID. [Person1]:  I forgot to bring that with me. [Person2]:  You need it to pay your fine. [Person1]:  Why can't I just give you the money for the fine? [Person2]:  Because, I need to see a photo ID in order to verify who you are. [Person1]:  Okay, I think I understand. [Person2]:  All right, come back and bring your ID. [Person1]:  So once I pay this off, my record will be cleared? [Person2]:  Once you pay it, your record will be cleared.
[Person1]:  Your resume says you have had one years experience working in a foreign representative office in Shanghai, may I ask why you quit? [Person2]:  I worked in a foreign representative office for one year. However, I leave there two years ago because the work they gave me was rather dull. I found another job that was more interesting. [Person1]:  Have you done any work in this field? What have you learned from the jobs you have had? [Person2]:  I have learned a lot about business know-how and basic office skills. In addition, I learned at my previous jobs how to cooperate with my colleagues.
[Person1]:  No.11 Police Station. Can I help you? [Person2]:  Yes. It's about my son Leech. He went to the school this morning but hasn't been hack yet and it's 6 [Person1]:  Just a moment, please. May I have his name? [Person2]:  Leech Smith, 112 Broadway. [Person1]:  Thank you. Now Mrs. Smith, what is the matter exactly? [Person2]:  Well, Leech left home at 7 o'clock this morning, but just now her teacher called me and asked why Leech didn't go to school. [Person1]:  Do you think it's possible that he went to friend's home? [Person2]:  I don't think so. I called her friends and our neighbors, but none of them had seen Leech today. [Person1]:  I see. Now, Let's move to some details. How old is he? [Person2]:  10 years old. And he is 1.5 meters' tall. [Person1]:  What's he wearing? [Person2]:  A blue shirt, and white shoes, carrying a green school bag. [Person1]:  We'll do our best to find him, Mrs. Smith. Please try not to worry.
[Person1]:  How about your exam? [Person2]:  I failed again. [Person1]:  Why? Did you oversleep again? [Person2]:  No, I didn't. [Person1]:  Then, what's wrong with you? [Person2]:  Oh, I can't tell you. [Person1]:  Tell me. Maybe I can help you. [Person2]:  Nobody can help me. [Person1]:  Don't say things like that. Tell me your trouble. We are good Mends, aren't we? [Person2]:  Yes. It's something like this. This time, I made full preparations, but Smith told me he could get perfect marks. I decided to copy his paper and I did copy, though not completely. It turns out that his marks were lower than mine. And we both failed. [Person1]:  lt serves you right.
[Person1]:  We've just moved into a house. [Person2]:  Really? Congratulations! [Person1]:  Thank you, and we want to buy a new television set. [Person2]:  What kind of television do you want to buy? [Person1]:  A colour TV set, of course, but I'm not sure about the size. Maybe we should buy a big one. If we buy a small one, we might have to change it in a few years' time for a bigger one. That would be a waste of money. What's your opinion? [Person2]:  I don't think it's necessary to buy a very big one. [Person1]:  Any reason? [Person2]:  Yes. As I know, your sitting room isn't very big. If you put in a very big television, it will be bad for your eyes, and a smaller TV set can still pick up good programmes. [Person1]:  Mm, that's quite true. I'll think about it. [Person2]:  You'd better make a quick decision because the price may go up soon.
[Person1]:  Oh, I'm fed up with my job. [Person2]:  Hey, there's a perfect job for you in the paper today. You might be interested. [Person1]:  Oh, what is it? What do they want? [Person2]:  Wait a minute. Uh, here it is. The European Space Agency is recruiting translators. [Person1]:  The European Space Agency? [Person2]:  Well, that's what it says. They need an English translator to work from French or German. [Person1]:  So they need a degree in French or German, I suppose. Well, I've got that. What's more, I have plenty of experience. What else are they asking for? [Person2]:  Just that. A university degree and three or four years of experience as a translator in a professional environment. They also say the person should have a lively and inquiring mind, effective communication skills and the ability to work individually or as a part of the team. [Person1]:  Well, if I stay at my present job much longer, I won't have any mind or skills left. By the way, what about salary? I just hope it isn't lower than what I get now. [Person2]:  It's said to be negotiable. It depends on the applicant's education and experience. In addition to basic salary, there's a list of extra benefits. Have a look yourself. [Person1]:  Hm, travel and social security plus relocation expenses are paid. Hey, this isn't bad. I really want the job.
[Person1]:  I feel very ill, Doctor. [Person2]:  What is the matter with you? [Person1]:  I have a terrible sore throat. I have a headache, too. [Person2]:  Have you been coughing and sneezing? [Person1]:  I cough a lot, but I don't sneeze. [Person2]:  Put this thermometer under your tongue. I want to see if you have a fever. Let me see. Yes. You have a fever. [Person1]:  Is my temperature very high? [Person2]:  No, not very. Here is a prescription. Stay in bed and rest. Drink hot tea. Come in and see me in my office on Monday.
[Person1]:  I visited the new museum near the city center last month. It opened two weeks ago. You'd like it. [Person2]:  Why? Is there lots of information about trees? [Person1]:  No. It's mainly about wild birds that live in the forest. When I went there, there was a special plant exhibition, and they're having a study day for teenagers there about different kinds of clouds. [Person2]:  That's useful for me when I go sailing.
[Person1]:  What's the problem, Nada? You look down in the dumps.  [Person2]:  I don't know. My life is a big mess. Everything is so compliceted.  [Person1]:  come on, nothing can be that bad.  [Person2]:  but promise me, you'll keep it a secret.  [Person1]:  ok, I promise. So what's troubling you so much?  [Person2]:  I've fallen in love with my boss.  [Person1]:  really? Is he married?  [Person2]:  no, of course not. He is still single.  [Person1]:  then what's your problem?  [Person2]:  I try to keep it to myself. But there is a lot of gossip about us.  [Person1]:  oh, I see. Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip.  [Person2]:  worse still, he is trying to avoid me these days.  [Person1]:  office romance is very tricky.  [Person2]:  it gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed.  [Person1]:  cheer up, Nada. You'll be fine. 
[Person1]:  Hello sir, may I help you? [Person2]:  Yeah, I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet. [Person1]:  I see. Well, you have come to the right place. We have over one hundred models of more than twenty leading mobile phone manufacturers. [Person2]:  Sounds good. I don't want it to be too expensive, maybe something mid-range. [Person1]:  We have this new ETC smart phone. It comes with the Android OS so you can download applications. It also has a built-in camera, mp3 player and touch screen. It works on the 3G network so you have fast access to the internet wherever you are. [Person2]:  What about Wi-fi? [Person1]:  Of course! You can access the internet from any hotspot as well as from home. [Person2]:  One last thing. Is it waterproof?
[Person1]:  Hello there. Is there anything I can help you with? [Person2]:  Yes, please. 70, 000 US dollars is being transferred into our account. [Person1]:  Which company are you from? I'll check your details. [Person2]:  I'm the accountant with Go Thong Computers. [Person1]:  Ah, yes. Mr. Can, isn't it? Yes, the money has been transferred successfully. But you'll need to change it into RMB before you can have it. [Person2]:  No problem. Can I withdraw all of it now? [Person1]:  You have an account with us, right? If so, there shouldn't be any problem.
[Person1]:  OK, Devon, I've been putting on a few pounds and you're quite a lean fit guy. [Person2]:  Well, thank you. [Person1]:  What do you recommend? What can I do to lose weight? [Person2]:  Well, I exercise a lot. I go running at least three times a week. But more than that I enjoy playing sports and so different sports use different muscles and all of it helps to lose that weight that you might have gained. [Person1]:  Yeah, well, actually, one of the problems is that I actually exercise a lot. [Person2]:  Do ya? [Person1]:  Yeah, so maybe it's my diet. [Person2]:  It could be and so in that case you might want to eat something perhaps more nutritious or maybe even less of what you do eat. Maybe, I eat three meals a day and I try not to snack in between. No potato chips. No popcorn. No candy bars. [Person1]:  That's pretty tough!
[Person1]:  Well, my particular interest is collecting stamps, especially the rare ones. What about you? [Person2]:  I'm afraid that's not my cup of tea. I just find skin-diving attracting. [Person1]:  So have you ever been to the stamp display of the town?
[Person1]:  I cannot understand why she always helps and supports her brother. [Person2]:  Why do you say so? [Person1]:  Because he is often in trouble. [Person2]:  She has promised her mother that she would be with him through thick and thin. [Person1]:  Oh, I see.
[Person1]:  Thank you for joining us this evening at Chez Attitude. [Person2]:  I am Mr. Foster, and we have a 7 [Person1]:  Welcome, Mr. Foster, if you would have a seat in the lounge area, our hostess will be ready to seat you in just a moment. [Person2]:  We are going to have a drink while we are waiting. Please let the hostess know that she can find us there. [Person1]:  She will come and let you know when your table is prepared. [Person2]:  Those patio tables are new, aren't they? Would it be possible to be seated out there? [Person1]:  An outside table is available right now if you would like to be seated immediately. [Person2]:  We would love to sit outside. Thanks for your help! [Person1]:  Here is your table, and now may I take your drink order while you are considering what to have for dinner? [Person2]:  Yes, could you please bring us a pitcher of margaritas and four glasses while we are figuring out our dinner order? [Person1]:  I'll put your drink order in and be right back to get your dinner order. [Person2]:  We'll be ready to order by the time you get back!
[Person1]:  This is frank speaking, may i ask who is calling? [Person2]:  This is Jane, I'd like to speak to Mr. Wang, please. [Person1]:  I'm sorry, he is not here at the moment. He has gone to the International Business Center. [Person2]:  When do you expect him back? [Person1]:  I'm not sure, he didn't say when he wound return. If you'd like. you can leave him a message until he is back to you until the moment it's free. [Person2]:  Yes, thank you. When he gets back, please just let him know that jane called. And i need him to call me back. [Person1]:  Does he have your number? [Person2]:  Yes, he does. But i give it to you again. 5264453 6 [Person1]:  That was 5264453 6, right? [Person2]:  Yes, thank you very much. [Person1]:  You are welcome.
[Person1]:  Oh, I think Jimmy is coming up next! Jeez, he looks so small out there. [Person2]:  He is going to need to do some serious praying if he wants to get a hit off that player. That kid is only 12 years old, but he looks like he is already a professional baseball player! [Person1]:  Yeah... oh, no! Strike three on Marcus! That's two outs. [Person2]:  We always seem to strike out against pitchers that throw really fast. We just can't seem to be able to get the bat on the ball. Maybe the coach isn't working these kids hard enough in practice. [Person1]:  Oh, I don't know about that. I was a little early when I came to pick up Jimmy yesterday, and the coach was throwing really hard to them in batting practice. I think he usually does a great job. We should really have him over for dinner. [Person2]:  Yeah, let's look at the calendar when we get home. Oh, look, there he is! Come on, son! Get a hit! [Person1]:  Woo-hoo, let's go, Jimmy! [Person2]:  Oh, strike one... that's OK, big guy! Be patient up there! [Person1]:  You got this one... strike two... oh, honey, he was really late on that last one! [Person2]:  Keep your eye on it, Jimmy! You can do it! Just like we practiced... [Person1]:  Whoa! What a hit! It's gone! It's a home run! All right, Jimmy, way to go! Yee-haw! [Person2]:  That's my son down there!
[Person1]:  Jack, would you like to come to my house with your wife for dinner at six tomorrow evening? [Person2]:  We would like to. Who else will be there? [Person1]:  Well, I also invite the White's. [Person2]:  That sounds great. I enjoy making friends, chatting with others. I always stay at home and feel bored. By the way, is it a formal dinner or informal one? [Person1]:  Informal, of course, just feel at home. [Person2]:  Great! Oh, I can't wait.
[Person1]:  Well, the salad's almost ready. How's the beef going? I'm starving. [Person2]:  So am I. The beef looks just about ready. Just one minute ... ow! [Person1]:  What's the matter? [Person2]:  Oh, my finger, I burned my finger! [Person1]:  Oh, wait, I'll get some ice and put it on your finger. [Person2]:  OK. [Person1]:  There. [Person2]:  Ah, ah, much better. The ice really works. [Person1]:  How does it feel? [Person2]:  Oh, I feel good. Thanks. Let's eat.
[Person1]:  This is the good life! We have it good don't you think?  [Person2]:  Yeah of course! Although, don't you ever wonder what could have been?  [Person1]:  What do you mean?  [Person2]:  Well, sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things a little differently.  [Person1]:  For example?  [Person2]:  Like for example, if I hadn't studied architecture, I would have become an artist like I wanted to.  [Person1]:  I see. Yeah now that I think of it, I wouldn't have gotten married if I hadn't moved to this town and met Sally.  [Person2]:  You see! Everything happens for a reason! We wouldn't even have met if I hadn't been in that car accident ten years ago!  [Person1]:  Well, I have no regrets!  [Person2]:  I'll drink to that! 
[Person1]:  Have you heard what Fred did last night? [Person2]:  No. Not yet. What happened to him? [Person1]:  I guess he was a little drunk and he had a fight in the car with his girlfriend, while he got so mad at her that he drove his car straight into the front of a drug store. [Person2]:  What do you mean? [Person1]:  I mean he drove inside. The front of the store was completely broken up. Actually I saw it just now as I walked by. It still parked inside the store next to the milk. There, some food all over the car. It's a terrible state. [Person2]:  I'm afraid Fred is in trouble. Where is he now? [Person1]:  I hear he's in the police station. It's lucky no one was hurt.
[Person1]:  How was your dinner party? [Person2]:  I think it went pretty well. People really seemed to enjoy themselves. [Person1]:  That's nice. [Person2]:  But we shouldn't have invited my wife's boss again. We can never get him to leave. [Person1]:  Really? How late did he stay this time? [Person2]:  Until 2 o'clock in the morning. And we both had to get up early the next day. [Person1]:  Oh, he shouldn't have stayed so late. You should have asked him to leave earlier. [Person2]:  Well, it's pretty difficult to do that to my wife's boss.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, but I'm not feeling too well. I think I'm going to throw up. [Person2]:  There's an airsickness bag behind the seat that's in front of you. [Person1]:  I must've missed it. [Person2]:  Is this your first time flying? [Person1]:  Yes. I'm going to San Francisco. [Person2]:  Oh, it's a beautiful city. I think you'll like it. [Person1]:  Hey, I'm feeling much better already. [Person2]:  Sometimes if you don't think about it, that sick feeling will go away on its own. [Person1]:  Thanks. By the way, my name is Mary. [Person2]:  I'm Frank. Nice to meet you.
[Person1]:  Hello! Is this Mr. Chang? [Person2]:  Yes. Who is speaking? [Person1]:  This is Kelly speaking. I am calling from London. How are you, Mr. Chang? [Person2]:  Oh, Kelly, I couldn't recognize your voice. Well, I'm fine. [Person1]:  Mr. Chang, I just want to tell you that we are leaving London for Beijing by flight CP 645 on Saturday morning. Could you meet us at the airport, please? [Person2]:  Excuse me, I couldn't quite hear you. This line is crossed. Can you speak louder, please? [Person1]:  I will say it again... Do you hear me now? [Person2]:  Much better. I will definitely go to the airport to meet you. [Person1]:  Thank you very much. Goodbye. [Person2]:  Goodbye.
[Person1]:  I find that you spend little on handset charge every month. Have you any trick? [Person2]:  It's simple. You can use call transfer. [Person1]:  Is it so simple? [Person2]:  Sure. You know, we spend most of our time at home or in the office every day, so I receive handset calls with the hand-free telephone, so I need pay little for receiving calls. [Person1]:  It's true. [Person2]:  Call transfer has many other advantages. When I am in places where network can't cover, such as the high building, I also use call transfer function, which transfers my calls to the hand-free telephone and I will not miss any call. [Person1]:  That's all? [Person2]:  In hospitals or on planes, handsets will interfere with some equip-ment, so we must close our handsets. If you set call transfer, the problem will be solved.
[Person1]:  Are you okay, man? You don't look very well. [Person2]:  Ugh, I feel terrible. I went out last night with Trevor, and things got a little out of hand. [Person1]:  Nice! So, where did you guys go? [Person2]:  We hit a couple of local bars, and met up with some friends. Everything was cool until Mike came along, and it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday! [Person1]:  Oh no! Mike's birthday is a drinkfest for sure! [Person2]:  Tell me about it! We drank everything in the bar! [Person1]:  Is that why you missed work today? [Person2]:  Yeah. I woke up this morning feeling really nauseous. I threw up like five times. [Person1]:  Www! [Person2]:  I was so dehydrated that I drank like a gallon of water, and my head has been pounding all day. I swear, I'm never gonna drink again! [Person1]:  Too bad man, tonight is Tracy's going away party and she asked if you were gonna go. [Person2]:  Oh, yeah. I'm there!
[Person1]:  finally we're on board! [Person2]:  yes. It was so crowded. I'm worn-out. Let's find our seats. [Person1]:  are they window seats or aisle seats? [Person2]:  let me see. . . yes, one window seat and one aisle seat. [Person1]:  ok. But can I trade my seat with you? I prefer the one near the window. I'm a terrible flyer. I always get airsick and can never relax until after I've landed. [Person2]:  that's fine. I'd like to be on the aisle anyway. It's easier to get in and out. [Person1]:  thanks. Where shall we put our luggage? [Person2]:  I think the smaller carry-on bag can go in the overhead compartment, and the others can go under the seat. [Person1]:  good idea. [Person2]:  don't forget to keep the seat belt on. [Person1]:  ok. Hope it's a pleasant trip. [Person2]:  yes! [Person1]:  and no hijackers. [Person2]:  oh, you have too wild of an imagination.
[Person1]:  Welcome back! How was your vacation? [Person2]:  It was fantastic and nice, but I am glad to be back! Being a tourist can be really really tiring! [Person1]:  Where did you go for you vacation? [Person2]:  Because it's of the COVID-19, we got a really good package deal to Edinburgh, so we went there. [Person1]:  I've always wanted to go to the United Kingdom. Is Edinburgh in Scotland, isn't it? [Person2]:  Yeah, it's capital of Scotland. [Person1]:  Oh yes, I remember. The art festival is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world! Did you go to see the festival? [Person2]:  That was the first thing we did. I have a few pictures. Do you want to see them? [Person1]:  Sure. What's this one a picture of? [Person2]:  Oh, that's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling. I'm standing on the royal mile street, and there are people acting around me. It is in the centre of the city. [Person1]:  You don't look very happy in that picture. [Person2]:  No, by that time, I was sick of sightseeing and too many people. I had had enough of art galleries, cathedrals, fountains, statues, and palaces! [Person1]:  So what did you do? [Person2]:  We spent that afternoon walking around a second-hand market. We had a few coffees, watched a movie, and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel. [Person1]:  My travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing. Did you go to the Holyrood Palace? [Person2]:  Of course! You can't go to Edinburgh without going to their famous palace! I was surprised by how beautiful the palace is. [Person1]:  That's what everyone says! I can't wait to go for myself some day.
[Person1]:  How many credits are you taking this semester? [Person2]:  I have to have at least eighteen to keep my scholarships and grant. But so far, I only have fifteen. [Person1]:  What's the matter, are the classes you want full? [Person2]:  Yes. And now I'm down to either taking a class I'm not going to need or considering a double major. [Person1]:  If you were to take on a double major, what would be your first choice? [Person2]:  I think with International Business a language would be appropriate. [Person1]:  Have you even thought that far ahead? I mean what country would you like to do business with? [Person2]:  As a matter of fact, I would like to work in South America. So some Latin language like Spanish or Portuguese would work.
[Person1]:  How are you doing, Andrew? [Person2]:  Not well. I'Ve been feeling pretty lonely lately. [Person1]:  But you have so many friends! How could you be lonely? [Person2]:  You know what they say'a friend to all is a friend to none'. I don't feel like I really know any of my friends. In fact, I should probably call them acquaintances, not friends. [Person1]:  What about me? I'm your friend. [Person2]:  I know you are, you are my girlfriend. I wish I had a guy friend to hang out with sometimes. [Person1]:  I know what you mean. I find it difficult to make new friends, too. It's not as easy as it was when we were young, is it? [Person2]:  Not at all. [Person1]:  I'Ve made a lot of new friends since I started learning English. Maybe you could join a club or take a class to make some new friends. [Person2]:  That's a good idea. [Person1]:  What kind of qualities do you look for in a friend? [Person2]:  I'm not sure. I guess I'd like to meet some people who have a positive attitude and want to have a good time. [Person1]:  People who play ultimate Frisbee have a positive attitude ; maybe you should join the ultimate Frisbee club. [Person2]:  That's a possibility. Thanks!
[Person1]:  Hey, Joe! Where have you been these past few days? [Person2]:  I'Ve been busy with a first aid course that I started about a week ago at the Red Cross. [Person1]:  Cool! I'Ve always wanted to do something like that! Have you learned anything useful? [Person2]:  For sure! I mean we'Ve learned how to apply pressure to stop bleeding, how to check for a pulse, and even how to apply CPR! [Person1]:  Have you treated any real emergencies? [Person2]:  Well, they took us along with some paramedics. There was this guy who fell off his motorcycle and suffered a concussion as well as a couple of compound fractures. His wounds were pretty serious so they had to rush him to the hospital. It was intense! [Person1]:  I can imagine! I tend to faint when I see blood, so I think I won't be taking up a course like that anytime soon!
[Person1]:  You don't look very well. [Person2]:  I'm not feeling too well. I've caught a cold. [Person1]:  Is it because of the bad weather? It's been really miserable for the past tew days. [Person2]:  Hasn't it! It's been cold and windy recently. Do you like the weather here? [Person1]:  Not really, but I've got used to it now. [Person2]:  Oh, I'm going for a trip to New York this autumn. What's the weather like in New York? [Person1]:  Not quite good. It's windy and dry. We have got continental climate there. It's dry all the year round. Usually autumn is the best season of the year In New York. [Person2]:  Is it cold in autumn there? Should I take any warm clothes with me? [Person1]:  No, it isn't very cold at that time. You'll only need some light wool clothing with somejackets and shirts.
[Person1]:  How much do you pay wholesale for your products? [Person2]:  We have a few different wholesale vendors, so our cost varies a bit over the fiscal year. But the difference is miniscule, a fluctuation of about 0. 2 %. [Person1]:  That must impact your bottom line at least a little bit, doesn't it? After all, your sticker price is pretty much set in stone. How much do they go for retail? [Person2]:  Retail price is 29. 95 per unit. We take into consideration changes in supply cost when figuring this price. [Person1]:  Is that including tax? [Person2]:  No, that's the price before tax. The tax rate is varies from different marketing areas, so it is difficult for us to figure in. [Person1]:  How much is your profit margin then? [Person2]:  Our profit margin is in the neighborhood of 20 %.
[Person1]:  It's my first visit to Prague, I'll be here for three days for a conference, then I have a day on my own to do some sightseeing before I head back home. What do you suggest I see when I'm here? [Person2]:  There are many interesting places you should be sure to see. One problem is transportation, however. Because the city is very old, the roads are narrow and congested. If you only have three or four days to visit, you don't want to spend them waiting in traffic in a cab. I suggest you take the subway. [Person1]:  The subway? But is there a subway station next to my hotel? I have to go between the conference center and the hotel several times a day. . . [Person2]:  No worries, there's a subway station at the conference center itself, and a shuttle from your hotel to the conference center that takes only 5 minutes. When you do your personal sightseeing, you can first take the shuttle to the conference center, then hop on the metro. [Person1]:  Is it expensive to ride on the underground? [Person2]:  You can get a daily pass that will allow you to travel unlimited for the whole day for about 6 dollars. Otherwise, you can pay by trip, which is about 50 cents to 2 dollars each trip, depending on how far you go. [Person1]:  Is it easy to get lost? [Person2]:  No, no. . . . it's very hard to get lost. There are two lines, one that goes in a circle, the other that is straight. If you get lost, there are always subway attendants that can help you find your way.
[Person1]:  Is there a swimming pool in this hotel? [Person2]:  We don't have a full-sized swimming pool, but we do have individual swim stations. [Person1]:  What exactly does that mean? [Person2]:  Basically, a swim station is like a treadmill, except instead of running, you swim. [Person1]:  That sounds really neat. Is there an extra charge for these swim stations? [Person2]:  If you're a registered guest, you have free access to our swim stations. [Person1]:  Are the swim stations open 24 hours, like the rest of the gym? [Person2]:  To conserve electricity, the stations operate only from 7a. m. till 10. [Person1]:  I'll go down there as soon as I can! [Person2]:  I don't think you'll be disappointed. People really seem to like the swim stations.
[Person1]:  You know John? [Person2]:  Which John? Mr. Turnbow's son? [Person1]:  Yes. I'Ve read news about him in today's paper. [Person2]:  And he's bright and intelligent. I'm sure he can pass the university entrance exam. [Person1]:  I wish he could too. [Person2]:  How's your boy, Jack? [Person1]:  He's a bit tired, you know. It often takes him a couple of hours to brush up. [Person2]:  Poor boys! They work harder at school nowadays, don't they? [Person1]:  Good luck to them.
[Person1]:  Excuse me. I need to find out where the city center is. [Person2]:  Ah well, let me see ... You turn left and then go straight on. [Person1]:  Ah left, thank you. Er ... I wonder if you could tell me whether there's a museum somewhere in the city. [Person2]:  Well, it's further down the city center. You go across the bridge and it's on the other side of the river. [Person1]:  I see. Could you tell me a bit more about it? [Person2]:  I'm not really sure. I've never been there myself. I think it's quite interesting. [Person1]:  Worth visiting, you think? [Person2]:  Well, it's one of the tourist attractions of the city. [Person1]:  I see. Thank you very much.
[Person1]:  Hello, may I speak to Mr. Brown? [Person2]:  I am sorry, he is out for lunch. Would you like to leave a message? [Person1]:  Err, what time do you expect him back? [Person2]:  Say, in half an hour. [Person1]:  Thank you, I'll try back later.
[Person1]:  Good morning, madam. [Person2]:  Good morning. I wonder if you can help. I've lost my coat. [Person1]:  Where did you lose it, madam? [Person2]:  Er... I left it on a bus yesterday morning. [Person1]:  Can you describe it? Is it a raincoat? [Person2]:  No. It's a long white overcoat. It's got a belt, and one of those thick furry collars that keep your ears warm. It's a very nice coat, actually. [Person1]:  Hmm. I'm afraid we haven't got anything like that, madam. Sorry. But, may I have your name and your telephone number? We'll contact you as soon as we've got it.
[Person1]:  Let's try that song again. You played it well, but try to play the second part a little faster this time. [Person2]:  Ugh. I already played it three times! My hands are too cold to play well. [Person1]:  OK, let's try another song. Play the short, slow piece that you like so much, the one that sounds like guitar music. That should warm up your hands! [Person2]:  Oh, that one is easy! I played it four times this morning. It's my favorite. [Person1]:  Good! You will be a great piano player one day if you keep playing the songs that you enjoy!
[Person1]:  My amenities bill says that I owe $ 10 for a movie, but I never ordered one. [Person2]:  Let's see. It says that you were charged Monday at 9 [Person1]:  That's absolutely wrong! I was out exploring the city Monday night. [Person2]:  Okay, let me see what I can do for you. [Person1]:  Thank you. I didn't think it would be this simple. [Person2]:  I can take the $ 10 off your bill, but I need to charge you $ 2 for the service. [Person1]:  Are you serious? I have to pay $ 2 for a movie I never watched? [Person2]:  Unfortunately, sir, it's how the computer is programmed. [Person1]:  This is outrageous! I'm never coming back to this hotel again! [Person2]:  I'm sorry, sir. Perhaps you'd like to write a letter to headquarters.
[Person1]:  why are you in such a good mood today?  [Person2]:  well, yesterday, I decided to face my fear of heights.  [Person1]:  I didn't know you were scared of heights! Was it really bad?  [Person2]:  let me put it this way. I've never seen a porfessional soprts game in a stadium because I could never get myself to walk to the top of the stairs to sit down.  [Person1]:  so what did you do about it yesterday?  [Person2]:  I went sky-diving!  [Person1]:  you're kidding me! that sounds really scary!  [Person2]:  It was scary, but it felt great, too.  [Person1]:  weren't you scared?  [Person2]:  of course I was scared. But I had an instrustor that went with me and that helped.  [Person1]:  so have you cured your fear of heights?  [Person2]:  I think so. After I jumped out of the plane, I realized that I should just enjoy life. Worrying about it or not doing things out of fear is just plain silly.  [Person1]:  I'm impressed.  [Person2]:  are you scared of anything?  [Person1]:  well, sometimes I get scared when I'm in my apartment all by myself.  [Person2]:  what do you think is going to happen?  [Person1]:  I always worry that the door is unlocked or that a window is open and that a stranger will come in and steal my things.  [Person2]:  it sounds like you just need to be more careful. 
[Person1]:  Let me see. How much should I pay for you?  [Person2]:  Don't think about it!  [Person1]:  No, this will not do. Let me see.  [Person2]:  You pay for the taxi and dinner, then to even things up.  [Person1]:  Good ideas. 
[Person1]:  Hello sir, how may I help you?  [Person2]:  I would like to buy some flowers, please. Something really nice.  [Person1]:  I see, may I ask what the occasion is?  [Person2]:  It's not really an occasion, it's more like I'm sorry.  [Person1]:  Very well. This arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends. It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out. It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness.  [Person2]:  I think I'm gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear. What else do you recommend?  [Person1]:  Mmm, well this is our I'm sorry I cheated on you package. Two dozen red roses lined with tulips, carnations and lilies. The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you.  [Person2]:  I don't think that's gonna cut it. I need something bigger and better!  [Person1]:  I'm sorry sir but, what exactly did you do?  [Person2]:  Well, I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier.  [Person1]:  Get out of my store,you jerk! 
[Person1]:  Of course I'll pick you up Kevin. You're my favorite cousin. Great. I'll see you at 3 [Person2]:  Claudia, it's professor Albby. [Person1]:  Oh, hi, Professor Albby. How are you? [Person2]:  Fine, thanks. Miss Leska is sick today. She has a class from 2 [Person1]:  Oh, sorry. My cousin is visiting this week from Seattle and he arrives today at 3 [Person2]:  Oh, I see. Gee. I don't know what to do. [Person1]:  Well, wait. Listen, my roommate Terra can go to the bus station and meet my cousin. Miss Leska always helps me. [Person2]:  That's great. Thanks a lot. See you at 1 [Person1]:  Bye.
[Person1]:  Jack, I don't know how to write my resume. Could you tell me about that? [Person2]:  You should first write your name and contact information. [Person1]:  What does the contact information include? [Person2]:  Such as your land line phone number, mobile phone number and e-mail box. [Person1]:  Anything else? [Person2]:  Then you should write your objectives, such as seeking a position in foreign trade. [Person1]:  I see. It is the position desired [Person2]:  Yes. After that you should emphasize your skills, educational background and related experience. [Person1]:  I see. Skills are about specialty, and educational background is easy as well. But what about related experience? I have little work experience. [Person2]:  Don't worry. It will take time to accumulate experience. You need to be confident for yourself. [Person1]:  I see. By the way, should I write the educational background starting from elementary school? [Person2]:  Generally from the college [Person1]:  Thank you very much. I will write it right now.
[Person1]:  Hello. May I speak to Jerry, please? [Person2]:  Sorry, but he is out for lunch right now. [Person1]:  I see. Can you give me some idea how long he'll be back? [Person2]:  I think he will be back around 2 [Person1]:  That's nice. My name is Steven, my phone number is 6789777. Okay, I'll be waiting for his call. Thank you and bye! [Person2]:  My pleasure, bye!
[Person1]:  Can I get some medicine to help me? [Person2]:  For your high blood pressure, we have several choices of medications. [Person1]:  What types of drugs can I try? [Person2]:  Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic that helps you with water retention. [Person1]:  What about side effects from that medication? [Person2]:  Most people have no side effects. You will have to make sure that you drink plenty of liquids with this medication. [Person1]:  Do I only need to take that one drug? [Person2]:  I am going to add a second drug for now, Lisinopril, which is an ACE inhibitor. [Person1]:  What can I expect when I take that medication? [Person2]:  You will feel much better except for the fact that you might have a little cough.
[Person1]:  Ah! It hurts. Don't touch it. [Person2]:  What part hurts? [Person1]:  The shoulder. [Person2]:  Well, maybe you broke it. But what I'm worried about is this cut. [Person1]:  It's not a cut. It's a gash! It's bigger than a cut! Ah! I need a doctor. [Person2]:  C'mon. Just don't move. [Person1]:  I'm bleeding too much. [Person2]:  We don't have a decent First Aid Kit, do we? [Person1]:  Yes. My bike has one under the seat. Get it, quick! [Person2]:  There's some tape, iodine, and cloth bandages. I don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding. What we need is a tourniquet. [Person1]:  Wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm, then twist. That will work as a tourniquet. After that, you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound. [Person2]:  Good plan. Let me put some iodine on the cut. [Person1]:  No, forget that! Do the tourniquet first. I'm losing too much blood. [Person2]:  Alright, alright. How did you cut this so bad? [Person1]:  I ran it against that fence pole as I crashed. What do you think? Damn, it hurts! [Person2]:  We'll have to get you to a hospital. I can ride you on the back of my bike. [Person1]:  I'm lucky I wasn't killed. I must have been going around forty-five miles an hour. There was too much gravel on that corner. I slid out. [Person2]:  Yes, I almost slid too. Alright. This tourniquet is tight. How does it feel? [Person1]:  Make it tighter. I want the blood stopped. Then wrap some bandages around the cut. Then we can go. Ouch! I hope I can walk. [Person2]:  Alright, I'm twisting it around. You tell me when to stop. [Person1]:  There. Stop!
[Person1]:  Can you tell me what the date and time of our field trip is? [Person2]:  We are leaving on our science field trip at 8 a. m. next Monday. Do you have something to write that down on? [Person1]:  Yes, I can write that on my calendar. [Person2]:  That will be on the second of December. Be there half an hour early to get your bags on the bus. Do you understand? [Person1]:  Yes, I understand. [Person2]:  The bus will bring you back 6 days later on December 8th. Is someone coming to get you? [Person1]:  No, I don't have a ride yet. [Person2]:  We will be leaving the campground at 5 in the evening and arrive at our campus at 8 p. m. Any more questions. [Person1]:  How much will the trip cost? [Person2]:  I put all of that information in the packet. I'll give you another copy if you need one. See you on Monday!
[Person1]:  Have you seen that house? [Person2]:  Yes, it looks interesting. [Person1]:  You're right. I love it very much. [Person2]:  It must be old. [Person1]:  At least more than 100 years old. [Person2]:  Let's enter it! [Person1]:  I can't open the door. [Person2]:  It must be locked. [Person1]:  Let me ask the old woman in that reception office. [Person2]:  She can't answer you. [Person1]:  She must be deaf. [Person2]:  It must be a haunted house. Are you frightened? [Person1]:  Frightened? You must be joking.
[Person1]:  I don't think Poppas is right for this position. [Person2]:  I agree. He's got experience as a computer operator but he has very little training in programming. What about Anderson? [Person1]:  I like him. He seems very enthusiastic and he knows a lot about programming. [Person2]:  That's true. Do you think he is dependable enough, though? He's already had two different jobs this year. He might work for a couple of months and then decide to leave. [Person1]:  I suppose so. But his last supervisor wrote a three-page letter of recommendation. He says Anderson is an excellent programmer. [Person2]:  He probably is. But we don't want him to leave after we've spent a lot of time training him. Actually, I think Logan is the best candidate. [Person1]:  She hasn't worked since she got married, hasn't she? [Person2]:  She's been taking care of her family. But she is really devoted. [Person1]:  Oh, yes. The letter from her principal says she did a wonderful job. Do you think she'll be a good programmer? [Person2]:  I bet she will. She has an excellent letter of recommendation from her teacher at the institute she attended. [Person1]:  That's true. [Person2]:  And Logan seems more professional. She was well-dressed and seemed to have a very positive attitude about working for us.
[Person1]:  Sam, we are hard up for the everyday expenses. When can you find a job. [Person2]:  I'm looking for it, but you see, the market shard for jobs, too. [Person1]:  You liar, I saw you again in the inn. I bet you don't want to work at all.
[Person1]:  Today is the old couple's golden wedding. [Person2]:  That must be a long love story. [Person1]:  Yeah. They promised to stick together forever when they were young. [Person2]:  They have made it. Will our love last 50 years? [Person1]:  I don't know.
[Person1]:  Hello, Friendship Restaurant. May I help you? [Person2]:  I'd like to book a table tonight. [Person1]:  Yes, Sir. For how many people, please? [Person2]:  Eight. [Person1]:  What time? [Person2]:  Eight o'clock tonight, would you please set us in a private room? [Person1]:  So sorry, we're fully booked in that room. Would you like to make reservation some other time? [Person2]:  Maybe not, thank you all the same then.
[Person1]:  Oh, my god. How can you stand living in such a messy dorm? [Person2]:  Our place is spotlessly clean, compared with others. [Person1]:  Have you even tried to clean it once since you moved in at the beginning of the semester? [Person2]:  In fact, I just swept the floor three days ago. [Person1]:  I think we need to restart the dormitory sanitation inspection system. [Person2]:  I bet nobody will care about it.
[Person1]:  Good morning, Plaza Hotel. Can I help you? [Person2]:  Hello, I'm just checking the room rates. How much are the single rooms, please? [Person1]:  Well, sir, the singles are now from 180 to 240 dollars. [Person2]:  And the doubles? [Person1]:  The double rooms are now 270 to 330 dollars. [Person2]:  That includes tax, I suppose. [Person1]:  No. But the price does include breakfast and service charge is extra. [Person2]:  Thank you very much. I think I got that. That's singles from 180 to 240 dollars, doubles to 270 dollars. [Person1]:  No. The price of doubles is from 270 to 330 dollars. [Person2]:  Oh, I see. And can I get an extra bed if we need one? [Person1]:  Yes, of course. An extra bed is 45 dollars. [Person2]:  Okay, that's fine. Thank you very much. [Person1]:  You're welcome.
[Person1]:  Welcome. How can we be of service today? [Person2]:  Hello. My aunt in the US has sent me $ 500. She sent it yesterday, using the standard service. It's my birthday today, you see. [Person1]:  Well, happy birthday. If it was sent yesterday using the usual service, it should be here already. You do have an account with us, right? [Person2]:  Yes. Here's my card. Do you need my ID? [Person1]:  Please. Just to double check all the details. [Person2]:  There you go.
[Person1]:  Good day! What can we do for you? [Person2]:  I'm considering buying a new car, the old one hasn't been running too well recently, and was wondering what kind of credit you can offer me. [Person1]:  Buying a new car is a big expense ; we understand that, so we have a variety of loans to suit your needs. [Person2]:  That's great. I'm looking to borrow quite a large sum, though. [Person1]:  With our Personal Automobile Consumer Loan, the borrower can borrow up to 80 % of the purchase price. [Person2]:  That's good news. The car I'm interested in is priced at 120, 000 RIB, but I think I can get a bit of discount on that. I can afford to put up around 40, 000 RMB myself. [Person1]:  That's great. You will need to make an initial down payment of 20 %, and then we can get going with this. [Person2]:  The funds are all ready to go in my personal account, so let's transfer it.
[Person1]:  We are through. [Person2]:  Why? [Person1]:  Why? Isn't it obvious? First you impose way too much on me, and I'm tired away. Second, you stood me up on the Valentine's Day. [Person2]:  I'm very sorry for that, but I sent you several messages to explain, my mom was seriously ill, and I had to look afer her. [Person1]:  But I ended up with finding out lady that night, that you were with other girl at cafe near your home. [Person2]:  That girl was my cousin. [Person1]:  You've got so many cousins. I called you later that night. But you didn't have the guts to answer the phone. [Person2]:  I didn't take my cellphone with me at that time. [Person1]:  I don't buy a story. [Person2]:  I know you don't hear me right know, please calm down. Anyway, I don't wanna part. I'll drop by tomorrow. [Person1]:  No, don't, I don't want to see you anymore. Don't ever call me again.
[Person1]:  Ladies and gentlemen, our flight will be delayed for one hour due to the congestion of the airport. [Person2]:  Excuse me, Miss. What did the announcement say? [Person1]:  We'll be delayed for one hour, because the airport is very crowded. [Person2]:  No kidding! We'll miss the connecting flight. [Person1]:  Oh, will you? That's too bad. We're very sorry to cause you a lot of trouble. [Person2]:  I really have to get to Paris by this evening. Would you please try to find any other available flight?
[Person1]:  I'd like to recommend an extremely efficient work-out machine at this fitness club. [Person2]:  Great! I need your professional advice. [Person1]:  The rowing machine. So many people just ignore it, but it's a full body exercise. It combines strength training with the heart.
[Person1]:  How are you, Mrs. Brandon? [Person2]:  Pretty good. How are you doing? [Person1]:  Not so good. I just lost my job today. [Person2]:  I'm sorry to hear that. [Person1]:  How are your students doing? [Person2]:  They are very nervous about their final test. [Person1]:  I remember you gave our class a hard final test in my first year of college. Many of us failed. But I really learned a lot from you. You see, I can speak very good English. [Person2]:  Thank you for saying so.
[Person1]:  Excuse me. I'm with the airport office. I'm doing a survey. Can I ask you some questions? [Person2]:  Sure. Go ahead. [Person1]:  How do you feel about the arrival area? Were you happy with it? [Person2]:  Yes, but it's a long way from the gate to the Immigration. [Person1]:  Oh, I'm sorry about that. Well, how about Immigration? How long did it take you to get through? [Person2]:  Oh, it's really quick-it took me only about 3 or 4 minutes. [Person1]:  Oh, good. OK, then, I see you bought some duty free items. Were you happy with the prices? [Person2]:  Well, I thought they were a little high. [Person1]:  A little high? Compared to...? [Person2]:  Oh, to most places in Asia- although I will say the prices seem lower here than in the States. [Person1]:  I see. Well, how about the general appearance of the airport? [Person2]:  Oh, excellent. It's about the cleanest airport I've ever been in. [Person1]:  So, all in all it is clean and efficient? [Person2]:  Yes, oh, I've got to go, here comes my suitcase.
[Person1]:  What can I get for you today?  [Person2]:  Could I get a hamburger, please?  [Person1]:  Would you like cheese on that?  [Person2]:  No, thank you.  [Person1]:  Would you like a drink?  [Person2]:  Let me have a soda.  [Person1]:  What kind of soda would you like?  [Person2]:  May I have a Sprite, please?  [Person1]:  Sure, no problem.  [Person2]:  I would also like a bag of chips.  [Person1]:  Will that be all?  [Person2]:  That's everything. 
[Person1]:  Actually, you can take advantage of our 'New Millennium Woman' promotion.  [Person2]:  Does that include some kind of 'Love, Amy Card'?  [Person1]:  Yes. If your 'Love, Amy' purchases amount to 10, 000NT or more, you get a V. I. P. card and a 20 percent discount.  [Person2]:  Hmmm. . . I'll have to think about it.  [Person1]:  OK. Just think for a bit. I'll go help another customer. I'll be right back. 
[Person1]:  How was your trip? [Person2]:  Berlin was great. David really likes living there. We had a good time hanging out. The 5 days went by fast. [Person1]:  How long has David been there? [Person2]:  6 months. He seems to have gotten really comfortable there. He knew where all the best restaurants, cafes and nightclubs were, and the people there seemed really relaxed. It was a nice change from life in London. [Person1]:  Well, I like the pace of life here, and I thought German people are usually really serious.I visited a friend in Frankfurt 4 years ago and that's how they seemed to me. [Person2]:  Well, I think the German people in Berlin are different. There are a lot of creative people in Berlin. David knew a lot of painters, musicians and writers there. They were interested in art. I think most people in London are more concerned about money. [Person1]:  Maybe, but there are a lot of artists in London, too. [Person2]:  That's true. Anyway, David asked me to say hello to you. We were remembering the time we had when we all worked together.
[Person1]:  Hi, can I speak with the apartment manager, please? [Person2]:  Hello, this is the apartment manager speaking. [Person1]:  I'm calling about the apartment for rent on Main Street. [Person2]:  Would you be interested in seeing the apartment? [Person1]:  I would love to see it. [Person2]:  Are you free today at around 6 p. m.? [Person1]:  Yes, I will be able to make it then. [Person2]:  Well, I'll see you at 6 p. m. Do you know how to get there? [Person1]:  I used to live in that area. [Person2]:  I'll give you an application form when I see you. [Person1]:  That sounds good. Do I need to bring anything? [Person2]:  No. Just bring yourself.
[Person1]:  David, why didn't you clean the room? [Person2]:  I'm not in the mood. [Person1]:  Why are you feeling depressed? [Person2]:  I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me. That's a real let-down. [Person1]:  I don't think she will do such a thing. [Person2]:  But she did and made me disappointed. [Person1]:  Oh, cheer up. A girlfriend is not everything. [Person2]:  But she means a lot to me. [Person1]:  Then forgive her mistake.
[Person1]:  May I help you find something, sir? [Person2]:  I'm looking for an engagement ring for my girlfriend. I have an idea of what she likes, but I want to surprise her with something special, too. [Person1]:  We have all shapes, sizes, qualities and price ranges, do you know about the four Cs of picking a diamond? [Person2]:  I think so. Aren't the four Cs, cut, clarity, carat and color. [Person1]:  You've got it. Tell me a little bit about what you might be wanted. [Person2]:  Well, my price range is a 5, 000 dollars to 7, 000 dollars, I'm looking for a marquise cut on the wide band. [Person1]:  You have good taste. Let my show you what I have.
[Person1]:  I'd like to buy a fridge. What about the quality of higher products? [Person2]:  I strongly recommend it. As an international enterprise, it produces high quality household appliances. [Person1]:  Is there a warranty? [Person2]:  Yes, all their products have warranties. [Person1]:  How long is it? [Person2]:  The fridges is covered by a one-year warranty. [Person1]:  Which model is the best seller of this year? [Person2]:  This one. How do you like it? [Person1]:  It's too big for me. Could you recommend something else? [Person2]:  Sure, this way please.
[Person1]:  Room service. What can I do for you? [Person2]:  This is room 504. The room is so cold. [Person1]:  Have you turned on the air-conditioner? [Person2]:  Yes. of course. I turned it on half an hour ago. I don't think it work at all. [Person1]:  I am sorry, sir. We will send our staff right now.
[Person1]:  What sort of experience do you have? [Person2]:  I used to work as a mechanic and I was responsible for the maintenance of all the company vehicles. [Person1]:  Where was your last job? [Person2]:  I worked in Hanson Paper Company. [Person1]:  Why did you quit your last job? [Person2]:  Because the company is far away from home, and I have to study after work so I can't afford to waste time on the road everyday.
[Person1]:  Now, if I look here I see that you completed a BA in English? [Person2]:  Yes, that's right. After graduating from high school in New York I attended York University in the UK. My major was English, and my minor was business studies. I completed my BA in 2004. [Person1]:  Yes, I'm pleased to see that you also got a distinction. [Person2]:  Yes that's right. I'Ve always enjoyed studying. My friends say I'm a bit of a bookworm, but my father always pushed us to succeed school. [Person1]:  Well, it looks like his encouragement paid off Rebecca. So how about extracurricular activities at University? [Person2]:  Well I'Ve always been keen on writing, so I became the editor for the University student newspaper, which I really loved. Also I volunteered for a group called Shelter, to help the homeless in York. [Person1]:  What did that involve? [Person2]:  Providing warm meals and shelter, especially in the winter months. I found it really fulfilling to be part of that group. [Person1]:  I'm sure. Okay, now let's move on to your work experience, shall we? [Person2]:  Yes, okay.
[Person1]:  You did an excellent job in this project. [Person2]:  Thank you. It was a lot of hard work. But I'm glad I did it. [Person1]:  Congratulations. [Person2]:  When will you give me a raise? [Person1]:  Ha. . . I am not sure. [Person2]:  I feel quite embarrassed for having to request a pay raise so quickly. [Person1]:  Let me think. How much did you have in mind? [Person2]:  5 000 yuan per month. [Person1]:  That's a lot of money. Let me think about it carefully.
[Person1]:  What are you reading, Bill? [Person2]:  It's this week's New Scientist. Why? [Person1]:  I was just wondering. It looks interesting, but I've never actually read it myself. It's for real scientists, or can ordinary people like me understand it? [Person2]:  Oh, it's for anyone really. It usually has articles and stories about current affairs about science, as well as papers about new developments in research, I'm reading about a new telephone that allows you to see the person you are speaking to, as well as hear him. [Person1]:  Oh, I've heard about it. Is it on the market yet? Can I buy one? [Person2]:  No, not this one. But the company has made other models to try out on business. This one is special because of its color, and the images moving. [Person1]:  Oh, that's interesting. [Person2]:  You see, the first videophones--that's what they are called--were made in Japan. But they can only show a still black-and-white image, so this videophone is much better than that. Mind you, I'm not sure I'd want one, would you? [Person1]:  Well, no. I don't think I would. I bet it costs a lot of money. Does it say how much it costs? [Person2]:  Yes. The early black-and-white ones cost several hundred pounds. But the one is about costs several thousand pounds. [Person1]:  Hum. Why does anybody want one, do you think? [Person2]:  Business organizations that need to frequently contact overseas organizations would want it. It's like a face-to-face conversation. So maybe a lot of overseas travel can be avoided. [Person1]:  Yes, I suppose so.
[Person1]:  Excuse me. but I think you made a wrong turn. You are supposed to turn left on Rosen Boulevard. [Person2]:  Oh. I'm sorry. Didn't you say 1323 Willson? [Person1]:  No, 3023. It's OK though. You don't have to take me there, I can walk from here. [Person2]:  Why don't I just make a U turn at the corner? [Person1]:  Well, you shouldn't make a U turn there. It's the one-way, street. See the sign up the head? [Person2]:  Well, maybe if I turn left here I can comedown the next street, [Person1]:  You can't do that either during the rush hour. Really though, don't go to any trouble. Sometimes one can wait 30 minutes for a taxi. So I'm happy to get this close, [Person2]:  Thirty minutes! I've been riding around all day looking for passengers.
[Person1]:  Hello, Nancy. I'm sorry, but I just missed the 8 [Person2]:  It doesn't matter. The next bus will be coming at 9
[Person1]:  I'm forming a music band.  [Person2]:  Do you already know how to play an instrument?  [Person1]:  Uh. . . Yeah! I've told you a thousand times that I'm learning to play the drums. Now that I know how to play well, I would like to form a rock band.  [Person2]:  Aside from yourself, who are the other members of the band?  [Person1]:  We have a guy who plays guitar, and another who plays bass. Although we still haven't found anyone to be our singer. You told me that you had some musical talent, right?  [Person2]:  Yes, I'm a singer.  [Person1]:  Perfect. So you can audition this weekend here at my house.  [Person2]:  Great! Wait here? You don't have enough room for the amplifiers, microphones or even your drums! By the way where do you keep them or practice? 
[Person1]:  Are you going to the cafeteria downstairs?  [Person2]:  Yes.  [Person1]:  Could you please get me a takeaway? I have some urgent work to finish. So I don't have enough time to go out for lunch.  [Person2]:  No problem. What should I bring?  [Person1]:  I am not picky on food. Just bring me the day menu. 
[Person1]:  I need to order new business cards.  [Person2]:  Do you have any idea how many you'd like?  [Person1]:  I think 2, 000 would be enough.  [Person2]:  Would you fill out this form, please?  [Person1]:  I don't want to make any changes to my old card.  [Person2]:  If you detect any difference, I'll take you out to dinner.  [Person1]:  . . . Okay, that's it. Here's the form, and here's my old card to use as a model.  [Person2]:  Thank you. Your order will be ready seven days from now.  [Person1]:  I need it sooner. Let me have it in three days, okay?  [Person2]:  We can certainly give you faster turnaround, but it will cost you extra. 
[Person1]:  I've got some bad news about the bike you lent me.  [Person2]:  What's that?  [Person1]:  I fell on the way to school, and your bike got scratched. I'm really sorry.  [Person2]:  Don't worry about it. It's not new, it already has a few scratches. Did you get hurt?  [Person1]:  No, thank you.  [Person2]:  That's the most important thing.  [Person1]:  It's kind of you to say. I feel a little stupid.  [Person2]:  Forget about it.  [Person1]:  When you lent me the bike, it looked brand new, almost anyway.  [Person2]:  Maybe, but really I have fallen a couple of times and it's been hit once or twice as well.  [Person1]:  I appreciate that, thank you. 
[Person1]:  What do you think are the most important things to do when running a business?  [Person2]:  Well, there are several things. Of course, you must do everything you can to keep costs down and revenues high.  [Person1]:  So, do you think workers should be paid as little as possible?  [Person2]:  No. if you do that, the workers won't like their jobs. They will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover. Those things will increase you costs.  [Person1]:  How can a business maxmise revenues?  [Person2]:  You need to invest in some good adverstising. You have to know where your potential customers are and target them. It's no good trying to sell computer games to older people. The market is too small.  [Person1]:  What else do you suggest?  [Person2]:  Find out what other companies charge for the same products or services. Price yourself near the low end. Don't be much cheaper than everyone else, because many customers distrust very cheap things. They think that is must be poor quality if it's that cheap. 
[Person1]:  Good morning, Ann. [Person2]:  Good morning, Mr.Jones. [Person1]:  How about a cup of coffee? [Person2]:  I will make it now. [Person1]:  And can you tell me what meetings I have this week? [Person2]:  I will bring the diary. OK, this afternoon you have a meeting with your accountant at 5 [Person1]:  OK, what time is my meeting in London? [Person2]:  At 11
[Person1]:  Why don't you sit down? Now there are several questions I must ask you if you don't mind. [Person2]:  Not at all, go ahead. [Person1]:  What is the purpose of your visit to the state? [Person2]:  I'm going to attend a conference on air pollution. [Person1]:  When and where is this conference being held? [Person2]:  It's being held in the first two weeks of February at Stanford University in California. [Person1]:  Who will pay your expenses? [Person2]:  Stanford University. Here is the official letter of invitation. [Person1]:  I see, fine. When do you want to go? [Person2]:  I'd like to leave in mid January of my passport is ready by then. [Person1]:  That shouldn't be difficult. Why don't you found me about January tenth? I should be able to give you an answer then. [Person2]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  Mary Westin, it's been 100 years. I haven't seen you since we were in high school. [Person2]:  Randy Bedford, Oh my goodness. You look exactly the same. Even your hair is the same, curls everywhere. [Person1]:  Well, you look a lot different. But I mean that in a good way. [Person2]:  Well, I got tired of that blonde hair. So I decided to become a redhead. I also lost a lot of weight. I don't want to look like I did in high school ever again. [Person1]:  So what do you do? [Person2]:  I'm a lawyer in Brookefield. I just come out here on weekends to do my shopping. What about you? [Person1]:  I sell insurance, but I'm actually working in Springfield, where to open a new office here in Irvington. So that's why I'm out here. [Person2]:  Do you like your job? [Person1]:  Well, I guess I make a nice living. But it's really boring work. I wish I could just change careers. [Person2]:  I agree. I actually have the opposite problem. I work for an environmental law firm, so the work is exciting. The only problem is that the pay is quite low. So I'm basically living hand to mouth every month. [Person1]:  I'd switch places with you in a second. Say, would you like to have dinner with me tonight? I know a great seafood place. [Person2]:  That would be fantastic.
[Person1]:  Did you see the picture of the guy on the front page of the newspaper this morning? [Person2]:  No. I haven't had a chance to read the paper yet. [Person1]:  you've got to see it. It's an unbelievable picture! [Person2]:  What's so interesting about it? [Person1]:  Well, this guy fell asleep on the sofa and when he woke up, half his face had been bitten off! [Person2]:  What? How did that happen? [Person1]:  They think his dog was trying to wake him up and couldn't, so ended up biting him in his face. [Person2]:  Wow. What does his look like now? [Person1]:  It looks pretty frightening. He doesn't have any lips, so all you can see are his gums and teeth. Most of his nose and chin are missing too. [Person2]:  What did he look like before his dog bit his face off? [Person1]:  He was actually quite handsome. What a shame. [Person2]:  What's he going to do now? [Person1]:  It said that he's hoping to get a face transplant, but until then, he's looking forward to Halloween so he isn't the only one wearing a mask.
[Person1]:  How about you and Tom? What time is your wedding? [Person2]:  Don ' t be kidding, OK? [Person1]:  What ' s the matter? So angry. I ' m just playing a joke with you. [Person2]:  Because I have given him up as a bad job. Our relation has been over.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, can you tell me the name of the book you read? [Person2]:  Harry Potter. [Person1]:  Harry Potter? Is that book funny? [Person2]:  Actually, the language itself is not so funny, but you can imagine the scene, that's funny. [Person1]:  Got it. [Person2]:  Have you ever read this book before? [Person1]:  No, but my little brother likes it very much. [Person2]:  It's really a good book. You will like it too. [Person1]:  I'll try to read it. Actually, I like literature very much. [Person2]:  Wow, that sounds like a scholar. By the way, who's your favorite writer? [Person1]:  Jane Austen. [Person2]:  Me too. Pride and Prejudice is my favorite. [Person1]:  I like it too. But Sense and Sensibility is my favorite.
[Person1]:  Hello, Mr. Gao. We appreciate your letting us have the apartment. [Person2]:  My pleasure. You're a sweet couple. Do you have any questions? [Person1]:  The ad said rent was thirty thousand. That includes utilities and phone, I assume. [Person2]:  No, it doesn't. And there's a maintenance fee for each month. It's forty NT per ping. [Person1]:  That's another one thousand six hundred? [Person2]:  Yes, but that doesn't include cable. It's for cleaning and trash removal. You just leave your trash outside your door.
[Person1]:  Good morning. My name is Penny White. I'm new here. [Person2]:  Nice to meet you. My name is Tyler Smith. Let's go to your office desk, follow me please. [Person1]:  OK. [Person2]:  Here is your working place. Nancy will come to show you how to set up the telephones. I'm going to call her now so that you can get started. Is that OK? [Person1]:  Yes, that's OK. I'm glad to get started. [Person2]:  If you have any further questions, just ask me. [Person1]:  OK. Thank you very much. [Person2]:  You are welcome. Have a nice day.
[Person1]:  . . . Now that we have been over the gory details of our disastrous first quarter, Ed! Give us some good news. How are things looking for us in termsof sales this month?  [Person2]:  Uh well. . . would you like the bad news first or the really bad news?  [Person1]:  What? Ed, don't tell me you only have bad news!  [Person2]:  Well sir, our sales have dropped, no plunged, fifty percent in the past month alone. We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits arefalling fast. The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory, or getting rid of our staff. If we consider redundancies, it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages. It's a real mess.  [Person1]:  For crying out loud. . . How fast are we losing money?  [Person2]:  Um. . . how can I put this? Let's just say that at this pace, we will be filing for Chapter eleven in less than three months.  [Person1]:  What! Geez! How could this have happened? So what's the bad news?  [Person2]:  Oh, that's the really bad news. Our supplier suffered QC problems and, well, half of our production is faulty. We're going to have to recall all itemssold in the last quarter. And the worst part? We're going to have to shoulder this cost.  [Person1]:  Are you joking? Get the supplier on the line now! They have to assume the costs of this mess!  [Person2]:  We tried that, sir. The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country.  [Person1]:  We're doomed!  [Person2]:  There is some really good news though!  [Person1]:  Really? What!  [Person2]:  I got offered a new job! 
[Person1]:  Jack and Mary broke up. [Person2]:  It's so sad. They had been together for only two months. Do you know what the matter was? [Person1]:  Mary said Jack was cheating on her. Jack was seeing a girl from his hometown. One day, May saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately. [Person2]:  Really? I'm very surprised. He doesn't look like a guy who'd ever do that sort of thing, right? [Person1]:  No, he doesn't. Anyway, she found out that he had been two-timing her for a long time. [Person2]:  Maybe it is for the best. They are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people. [Person1]:  How so? [Person2]:  He is an extrovert while she is an introvert. He likes parties while she hates them. [Person1]:  Poor Mary! She really liked him. [Person2]:  Anyway, she was right to end things and she deserves better. [Person1]:  Do you think they'll get back together? [Person2]:  No, I don't think so. I know Mary. Once she makes a decision, she won't change her mind. [Person1]:  I hope she'll recover soon. [Person2]:  So do I.
[Person1]:  I hear you're being sent to Madrid for the annual conference. Is that right? [Person2]:  Yes, it would be my first trip overseas. Actually, it's going to be my first time leaving the country. [Person1]:  Are you serious? You haven't even been anywhere on vacation? [Person2]:  No, I have never vacationed anywhere exotic. But even if I don't get a chance to travel on my personal time, at least I can travel on company time! [Person1]:  Well, being able to go to the conference sounds like such a great opportunity. Have you applied at the embassy for a visa yet? [Person2]:  Yes, it wasn't too hard to get. All I had to do was fill out the paperwork and pay the application fee. [Person1]:  You leave next Tuesday, right? What time is your flight? [Person2]:  My flight departs at 7 am. I have everything except for my luggage ready. [Person1]:  If your flight is leaving so early, I can take you to the airport and see you off. I'll still be able to make it into the office by 9. [Person2]:  That would be great! Thanks a lot!
[Person1]:  I'm sorry, but I can't find the book you lent me. I guess I have lost it. [Person2]:  Don't worry about it. [Person1]:  I really feel bad about it. Let me buy you a new one. [Person2]:  No. Don't be silly. I wouldn't dream of letting you do that.
[Person1]:  I heard Rose is pregnant. I hope it'll be a boy this time. [Person2]:  I hope so, too. Rose and her husband have been wanting a boy so much. [Person1]:  After three baby girls in a row, Rose is under a lot of pressure from her in-laws. They want a boy in the worst way now. [Person2]:  But baby girls are just as good and just as fun as baby boys. [Person1]:  I agree with you, but you know how old-fashioned the elders are.
[Person1]:  Did you watch TV last night, Rose?  [Person2]:  Yeah. I saw a science program. It was quite interesting.  [Person1]:  What was it about?  [Person2]:  Mars. Scientists say there might be water on it.  [Person1]:  If so, we may live there someday.  [Person2]:  I hope so. Did you know the US successfully sent two robotic explorers to Mars last month?  [Person1]:  Sure. I heard about this on the TV. On January 3rd , 2004, Explorer Spirit landed near the so-called Gusev Crater. And three weeks later, Spirit's twin explorer, Opportunity, landed on Meridiani Planum named by scientists.  [Person2]:  Yes. Both have sent back pictures of the planet. And the latter did a better job. 
[Person1]:  David, I am going for an interview tomorrow. It's an American company. Can you give me an idea of what the interviewer will ask? [Person2]:  Well. They may ask you to tell them more about your educational background and your working background. [Person1]:  But they can see my resume. It's all in there. [Person2]:  I know, but sometimes interviewers just want to hear you say it. Then you may be asked for your viewpoint on why you feel you are qualified for the job, give them all your qualifications and how you think they will fit the position you are applying for. Questions like what sort of experience do you have and what are your goals? are closely related to this. [Person1]:  Ok. What else? [Person2]:  They may want to know how the company will benefit and why they should hire you? [Person1]:  I see. What about the salary? [Person2]:  Hm, they may ask you what kind of salary you have in mind, or simply tell you what the company is offering. I think the latter is more likely for a starting position, especially if you have little experience. And if they are seriously considering hiring you, they will probably want to know when you would be available to start work. And basically, that's about it. [Person1]:  Ok, thanks, David. You'Ve helped me a lot. [Person2]:  Anytime. Let me know how it works out.
[Person1]:  Good morning, sir. May I help you? [Person2]:  It's our anniversary today. I am looking for the same flowers as the ones in her wedding bouquet. [Person1]:  What do they look like? [Person2]:  White. [Person1]:  How tall are they? [Person2]:  They are short, I guess. About the same height as those short flowers over there. [Person1]:  Do they look like roses? [Person2]:  No, they look like little bells. [Person1]:  Oh, lilies of the valley. No, I am sorry. We are all out of them right now. [Person2]:  Oh, that's too bad. [Person1]:  What about roses? [Person2]:  Ok. How many do you suggest? [Person1]:  As many as you like, sir. They are beautiful, aren't they? [Person2]:  Yes, they are.
[Person1]:  Please pull your vehicle over to the side of the road. Please roll down your window. [Person2]:  What's the matter, sir? [Person1]:  Have you been drinking? [Person2]:  No, I haven't sir. [Person1]:  Really? But I can smell alcohol on your breath. Blow into this breathalyzer, please. [Person2]:  But, sir, I didn't drink at all. [Person1]:  If you refuse to blow, you'll receive a much severer punishment. [Person2]:  OK. I'll blow. [Person1]:  Your BAC exceeds the legal limit. [Person2]:  But I. . . [Person1]:  I'll have to write you a ticket and suspend your driver's license for 3 months.
[Person1]:  I got two letters this morning with job offers, one from the Polytechnic, and the other from the Language School in Pistoia, Italy. [Person2]:  So you are not sure which to go for? [Person1]:  That's it. Of course, the conditions of work are very different [Person2]:  I see. So it's much less secure. But you don't need to think too much about steady jobs when you are only 23. [Person1]:  That's true. [Person2]:  What about the salaries? [Person1]:  Well, the Pistoia job pays much better in the short term. I'll be getting the equivalent of about 22,000 pounds a year there, but only 20,000 pounds at the Polytechnic. But then the hours are different. At the Polytechnic I'd have to do 35 hours a week, 20 teaching and 15 administration, whereas the Pistoia school is only asking for 30 hours teaching. [Person2]:  Mmm... [Person1]:  Then the type of teaching is so different. The Polytechnic is all adults and mostly preparation for exams like the Cambridge certificates. The Language School wants me to do a bit of exam preparation, but also quite a lot of work in companies and factories, and a couple of children's classes. Oh, and a bit of literature teaching. [Person2]:  Well, that sounds much more varied and interesting. And I'd imagine you'd be doing quite a lot of teaching outside the school, and moving around quite a bit. [Person1]:  Yes, whereas with the Polytechnic position, I'd be stuck in the school all day.
[Person1]:  Hi, Jane. It's nice to see you again. I heard that you went to the US during the vacation. [Person2]:  Yes. I went to New York to attend a summer course in English. [Person1]:  Wow. You were lucky. How long did you stay there? [Person2]:  About 50 days. I went there on July 5th and came back on August 25th. [Person1]:  How about the course? [Person2]:  The course was very good. The teachers were nice. They taught us to listen, speak, read and write in English, but it was mostly speaking. One interesting thing I found was that the American classes are different from our classes here because the students have a lot more freedom. You can sit anywhere you like in the classroom. You can ask the teachers questions at any time during the class, and you are welcome to share your ideas with the class. I really like this kind of class. [Person1]:  How interesting! Maybe our teacher should try that.
[Person1]:  Now, can we get the computers before Wednesday? [Person2]:  Well, it depends, if it is less than 10 kilometers, we can deliver them on Tuesday, but it is further away, it will be on Thursday. Where is your office? [Person1]:  Just around the corner.
[Person1]:  Hello. This is James Goodfellow from Channel 4 news. Today, we are interviewing Sarah Roberts, the star of the new movie, Zombies on Mars Part 4. Sarah, uh, thanks for joining us. [Person2]:  You're welcome, Jimmy. [Person1]:  It's, uh, James. [Person2]:  Whatever ... [Person1]:  Well, let's start off the interview with a few basic questions. First of all, where are you from? [Person2]:  Well, I'm originally from Miami, but we moved to New York when I was three years old. [Oh.] I lived there until I was 17, and then I moved to Los Angeles to be an actress. [Person1]:  Okay, and where did you go to college? [Person2]:  I attended Fernando's School of Acting, and all of my teachers LOVED my acting. [Person1]:  And, did you have a part-time job while you were in school? [Person2]:  Yeah. I worked at a movie theater, and everyone LOVED the way I made the popcorn. [Person1]:  Really. Okay, and how old are you now? [Person2]:  Well, I'm only 20, but everyone I know says I look at LEAST 22. [Person1]:  Oh, right. Okay. And, what are you hobbies outside of acting? [Person2]:  Oh, I love shopping for clothes and makeup and, and .... Did I say I love shopping for clothes? [Person1]:  Well, you DID say clothes ... [Person2]:  Oh, yeah. Well, do you want to take some pictures of me ... you know, for your homepage or your blog and you can even use them on your Facebook fan page. [Person1]:  Uh, I think we'll be okay. [Person2]:  Okay, well, um ... Oh, oh look, all of my fans. Hey, gotta go, honey. Hi everyone.
[Person1]:  Excuse me? I think you are in my seat. Look, it says 9B on my boarding card. [Person2]:  Sorry, but could we exchange seats? This is my old friend. We haven't seen each other for a long time. I really want to sit next to him. [Person1]:  In that case you can sit here, but where is your seat? [Person2]:  It's 7A. It's a window seat. [Person1]:  Oh, that's great. I asked for a window seat. But there were not any left. I really didn't expect I'd get one this way. Thank you.
[Person1]:  Have you seen this news article? Apparently an organization has made a list to name the new seven wonders of the world and people could vote for them online. [Person2]:  Wow, that's really interesting. So who won? [Person1]:  Well, the Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal in India. [Person2]:  I've been there! It really is an amazing work of architecture and art. The entire complex is made of white marble and in the interior of the tomb, the walls are covered with gems and emeralds! [Person1]:  Cool! Also amongst the winners is Petra, in Jordan, Mach Pitch in Peru and the pyramid in Chichenitza in Mexico. [Person2]:  Wait a minute! It also says that the Christ Re-deemer statue in Brazil and the Colosseum in Rome are wonders. I would love to go to Italy and see the Colosseum, stand in the middle like a gladiator! [Person1]:  Well, let's see if we can find some cheap airfare and we can go towards the end of the year. [Person2]:  Good idea!
[Person1]:  What do you say to eating out, Maggie? [Person2]:  Yeah, why not? We haven't been out for dinner for quite a long time. A new French restaurant has just opened in our neighborhood. We can go there. [Person1]:  Do we need to book a table in advance? [Person2]:  No need for that. It's not usually busy on weekdays. [Person1]:  What time shall we go? [Person2]:  Why not now? I'm hungry.
[Person1]:  Excuse me. May I ask you some questions? [Person2]:  Sure. What do you want to know? [Person1]:  Could you please tell me how many credits would be required for a bachelor's degree? [Person2]:  Well, you have to get 166 credits, including required courses and optional courses. [Person1]:  OK. And how long does it take to get a bachelor's degree? [Person2]:  It can be completed in four years normally. [Person1]:  I see. Thank you very much. [Person2]:  You're welcome.
[Person1]:  You did well on the math test. [Person2]:  Of course. [Person1]:  Don't you always fail in the math tests? [Person2]:  Things were different this time. I sat by a math genius. [Person1]:  Huh? You mean you snuck a peek at his test? [Person2]:  Calm down please! Come on man! I just took a glance at his paper. [Person1]:  Are you crazy? You were cheating.
[Person1]:  I am very nervous about signing my escrow papers. [Person2]:  Escrow involves a lot of paperwork, but I will explain all of the steps to you as we go along. [Person1]:  What should I have brought with me? [Person2]:  The only thing I will need to see is your driver's license, as I will be notarizing these papers. [Person1]:  I feel a little overwhelmed by so many papers. [Person2]:  Don't worry about how many papers there are. We are going to look at them one at a time. [Person1]:  My boyfriend is an attorney and told me that I could fax him anything if I had a question. [Person2]:  Please get any outside help that you need in understanding your escrow documents. [Person1]:  Is this the last thing that I will need to do before the house becomes mine? [Person2]:  At the close of escrow, the house will be yours!
[Person1]:  What arrangement will you make about payment? [Person2]:  We shall open an irrevocable L / C to cover our shipment from Shanghai to Hamburg. Is it at sight or after sight? [Person1]:  At sight of course. [Person2]:  Some customers demand that 80 % of the credit amount be paid at sight, and the rest be paid after the machines are proved satisfactory on trial. [Person1]:  I am afraid that can't be done. We have never done business on such terms. [Person2]:  But such terms are quite common in the machinery trade. Other suppliers are offering better terms. Some even allow payment 60days after sight. [Person1]:  We ask for full payment at sight, because we guarantee 90 % mechanical efficiency for all our products. You don't have the same guarantee from other suppliers. The usual percentage is around 85. [Person2]:  That's true. I'm eager to know if you could send some fitters to ensure good operation. [Person1]:  Yes. We usually send technicians abroad to offer after-sales service to our customers. [Person2]:  If you send fitters along with the machines to ensure that all the machines run properly, and if you provide after-sales service, we agree to make the payment in full. [Person1]:  Thank you. I am glad we have come to an agreement at last.
[Person1]:  Your silk garments have aroused much interest in our country ever since our first order was put on the market. We have no doubt we can do better this year if you appoint us your sales agent. [Person2]:  We appreciate your intention, but the amount of your orders last year was moderate. [Person1]:  That's true. However at the Fair last March, people were so interested in Chinese garments that the demand this year will surely increase. [Person2]:  Do you think it will help if we appoint a local agent? [Person1]:  I'm sure it will, if we are appointed your agent. Your garments are attractive, and we, a well-established importer with multiple sales channels, can boost the sales. [Person2]:  Well, we'll consider your proposal.
[Person1]:  Look, it says they want a junior sales manager and it seems like it's a big company. That'll be good, for you might have to travel a lot. [Person2]:  Do they say anything about the experience? [Person1]:  Let me see. It says the candidate should have at least two years' experience as salesman. [Person2]:  So there's little hope for me to get the job.
[Person1]:  Good morning, can I help you? [Person2]:  Yes, I'd like to join the library. We're new to the district, you see. [Person1]:  Well, all we need is some sort of identification with your name and address on it. [Person2]:  Oh dear. We just moved, you see, and everything has my old address. [Person1]:  A driving license, perhaps? [Person2]:  No, I don't drive. [Person1]:  Your husband would do. [Person2]:  Yes, but his license will still have the old address on it. [Person1]:  Perhaps you have a letter addressed to you at your new house? [Person2]:  No,I'm afraid not. We've only been there a few days, you see, and no one's written to us yet. [Person1]:  What about your bankbook? [Person2]:  That's just the same. Oh dear, and I did want to get some books out this weekend. We're going on holiday after the move, you see, and I wanted to take something with me to read. [Person1]:  Well, I'm sorry. What about your passport? [Person2]:  What? Oh yes, how silly of me. I've got a new one and it does have our new address. I've just been to book our tickets so I have it on me. Just a minute. Here you are. [Person1]:  Thank you. Well, that's all right.
[Person1]:  What do you usually do in your spare time? [Person2]:  I have joined a singing group and we practice two afternoons each week. [Person1]:  That's a very interesting thing to do. [Person2]:  Yes. It's a small group of only fifteen girls and boys. But nobody has been late for the practice. [Person1]:  I see. How many songs can you sing now? [Person2]:  We started only three months ago, but we've practiced eight songs. [Person1]:  Are you going to perform any time? [Person2]:  Yes, there will be a school show next month and we are going to sing a song in it. We are practicing a new song now. It's written by one of the singers in our group. [Person1]:  Really? What's the name of the song? [Person2]:  Sunny Days. [Person1]:  That's a nice name. I hope to listen to it soon. Can I visit you when you practice?
[Person1]:  Which language do you speak?  [Person2]:  Well, I studied French at school, but I've forgotten most of it. I learnt some Russian while I was studying there and now I study Spanish in evening classes. Do you speak Japanese at home with your pa  [Person1]:  Yes, I do. I'm learning Chinese now on the internet.  [Person2]:  How do you find studying a language on the internet?  [Person1]:  It's not easy, particularly with listening and speaking, because sometimes the connection isn't too good.  [Person2]:  I bet you find the character difficult to write!  [Person1]:  Actually, many of the characters are the same or very similar in both Chinese and Japanese, so they're easy for me.  [Person2]:  So , you can read and write much better than you speak and understand other speakers, right?  [Person1]:  Yes. How are the Spanish classes going?  [Person2]:  In a way, it's similar to your experience of learning Chinese. Some Spanish words are very similar to English ones. But I need to practise listening to native speakers and saying the words myself. 
[Person1]:  You say he was around average height.  [Person2]:  Yes, that's right, around five nine five ten.  [Person1]:  Weight?  [Person2]:  I'm not sure. Medium I suppose. Maybe a little on the heavy side.  [Person1]:  Any marks on his face?  [Person2]:  No, I don't think so.  [Person1]:  Glasses?  [Person2]:  No.  [Person1]:  What about his hair?  [Person2]:  Black or dark brown.  [Person1]:  Long or short? Straight? Curly?  [Person2]:  Straight, I think, and about average length  [Person1]:  Boy, this sure doesn't help us much. It could be anybody. How about his cloth? What was he wearing? 
[Person1]:  Is there anything I can do for you?  [Person2]:  Yes. I am looking for a pair of gloves.  [Person1]:  What about this one? It's the latest.  [Person2]:  Excuse me, but I want a pair of mittens.  [Person1]:  I am sorry, it's out of stock right now. 
[Person1]:  You only have an hour for lunch. [Person2]:  Well, now I have only 45 minutes. [Person1]:  That's not much time. Where should we go? How about Tornis Ettling Restaurant? Just across the street. I love the pizza. [Person2]:  I love the food too, but they are really slow. Last week, I waited 30 minutes for my food. [Person1]:  OK. Let's have a sushi at the David's. We can be in and out in 20 minutes. [Person2]:  Today is the Thursday, David's is not open. [Person1]:  Alright. Then let's go to the Jungle Cafe. We can be there in 60 seconds. [Person2]:  Good idea.
[Person1]:  David, I heard you had an unpleasant experience when you were on holiday in Florida. What happened exactly? [Person2]:  We were having an enjoyable day out at a wildlife park and suddenly this lion started walking towards me. [Person1]:  Oh, that must have been terrible. [Person2]:  Yes, it was. I started running away as fast as I could and I didn't see where I was going. I ran into a tree and hit my head quite badly. [Person1]:  Oh dear, you poor thing. And the lion? [Person2]:  Luckily, one of the park keepers put it back in its cage and called for first aid. So nothing more serious happened. [Person1]:  I'm pleased to hear that.
[Person1]:  Julia, how was your trip to Amsterdam? [Person2]:  It was great. You know the best thing I did? I rented a bicycle. It was really cool. I got to leave the college area and go out and meet some locals. They were really surprised when they found out I was American. [Person1]:  Why is that? [Person2]:  Well, they think Americans are all rich and fat and drive cars and never ride bicycles. [Person1]:  Yeah, well, that's kind of true. [Person2]:  Yeah, another interesting thing is that nobody locks their bikes there. [Person1]:  Really? [Person2]:  Yeah. I guess you don't have to. Nobody steals them. [Person1]:  Why not? [Person2]:  I guess it's because everybody has a bike. [Person1]:  Hmm...That makes sense.
[Person1]:  How do your spend your time after work or in vacation? [Person2]:  In my spare time, I am fond of traveling and I always take a trip with my family. [Person1]:  But traveling is an expensive hobby, isn't it? [Person2]:  You are deadly right.
[Person1]:  Where should I sit? [Person2]:  Why don't you sit in the back with me? [Person1]:  Okay. [Person2]:  By the way, what's your last name? I forgot what it is. [Person1]:  It's Lin. It's spelled L-I-N. [Person2]:  R-I-N? [Person1]:  My pronunciation is not very good. It's L-I-N, Lin. [Person2]:  I got it. Mary Lin. [Person1]:  Lin is a common Chinese last name.

[Person2]:  You might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area. I tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays. [Person1]:  OK. Now you can pick your fabric and pattern design. Please follow me.

[Person1]:  Do you have any history of back problem? [Person2]:  No, this is the first time. [Person1]:  Are you taking any medicine at the moment? [Person2]:  No. [Person1]:  Please sit here and I will let you in when it is your turn.
[Person1]:  Hello. Thank you for calling Spend Mart. [Person2]:  Is this the Customer Service Desk? [Person1]:  Yes. How can I help you? [Person2]:  I bought a sweater from your store a week ago. It says size 12. But actually it is a size 10. Can I exchange it? [Person1]:  Do you have the receipt with you? [Person2]:  Yes, I do. [Person1]:  I'd like to apologize for the mistake. Please come on down with your receipt and the sweater to exchange it for the size you want. [Person2]:  Thank you very much. [Person1]:  You are welcome.
[Person1]:  Have you seen Kate recently, Vicky? [Person2]:  Yes, I have. I saw her a couple of days ago. She hasn't been very well in the last couple of weeks. [Person1]:  Has she seen a doctor since she's been ill? [Person2]:  Yes, she has. The doctor told her to take it easy for a while, but she hasn't been taking his advice. She's as busy as usual. [Person1]:  Do you think it useful for me to ask her to have a rest when I go to see her? Or shall we go together? [Person2]:  I think you can go yourself and show your concern to her since she sometimes would take your advice. So it's unnecessary for me to go with you. What's more, I've got some other things to do at the moment.
[Person1]:  Did you feel like you need more hours from the day? Well, Good Housekeeping Magazine has some advice on how you can stop wasting time and get it all done. And here with the top ten tips, is Carolyn Forte. Hey, Carolyn, good morning! [Person2]:  Good morning, Hoda. Nice to be here! [Person1]:  Your No.1 tip is bank online. Some people are afraid to do it, but you say it's something smart. [Person2]:  Yeah, it is very safe. And we certainly recommend that you use your own bank's website. So go to the bank, talk to the consumer service representatives there. It's the best way to find out how safe it is and how easy... [Person1]:  And how much time do you think you could save, Carolyn, by doing that? [Person2]:  If you're making transfers, or checking your statements, you can save up to an hour. [Person1]:  The second tip is online grocers. Now, that's really not for everyone, but you actually go grocery shopping online. [Person2]:  That's exactly what you do. If you are the type of person that wants to read every label and look at every piece of fruit, it's probably not for you. But if you wanna give up a little control, you [Person1]:  And what's the good strategy if you decide to shop online? [Person2]:  What I would suggest is do the staples online. [Person1]:  What do they include? [Person2]:  The brands you use all the time, the paper products, the cleaning products, the cereals-get them online and go to the store for the meat in the produce. [Person1]:  That's enlightening.
[Person1]:  Is it true that rice is the staple food in most of Southeast Asia?  [Person2]:  I'm not an expert, but that's the impression I have.  [Person1]:  Is rice your staple food, too?  [Person2]:  Needless to say, as a Westerner, it's bread.

[Person2]:  I started feeling kind of sick last night after dinner, but this morning the pain got really bad! [Person1]:  Have you eaten anything unusual lately? [Person2]:  No, not that I remember. [Person1]:  We are going to take you to an emergency room right now. [Person2]:  I will feel better when I know what the problem is. Thank you for the drugs.

[Person1]:  So did you get in touch with your brother? [Person2]:  No, not yet. I'm really worried. [Person1]:  Well, it'd be foolish to call the police. He probably just went away overnight. [Person2]:  Maybe you're right. But I'm still worried.

That's very nice of you.

What's the reason you are sending her flowers? [Person2]:  Today's her birthday and she told me she wants me to buy her flowers. [Person1]:  Do you know what kind of flowers she likes? [Person2]:  I'm not sure. I know I should know that, but I can't remember right now. [Person1]:  Well, they're for your wife, so I think you should give her roses. [Person2]:  Roses will be fine.

[Person1]:  did you know that abortion is still illegal in many states in the USA? [Person2]:  why? I thought Americans were supposed to be more open than that. [Person1]:  well, for many religious people, they believe that people who abort their babies are murderers. [Person2]:  do you think most people in America believe that abortion is wrong? [Person1]:  no, I think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions. [Person2]:  it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in America. [Person1]:  religious people blame it on pre-marital sex, not on abortion being illegal. [Person2]:  what do you think about abortion? [Person1]:  I personally would never want to have one, but I think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life, she should have the right to decide for herself. [Person2]:  do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter? [Person1]:  I know this is going to sound sexist, but I don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children. [Person2]:  why not? It's their children, too. [Person1]:  that may be true, but when a woman gets pregnant, it changes her life completely. Men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand. [Person2]:  that might be true, but I think men should have some kind of say in the matter.
[Person1]:  You took an optional course this semester, didn't you? How's it going? [Person2]:  Terrible! It seems like the more the professor talks, the less I understand. [Person1]:  If I were you, I would take a different course. There are five optional courses, aren't there?
[Person1]:  Excuse me, is this seat taken? [Person2]:  I ' m afraid this seat is taken. [Person1]:  Oh. is it. Thank you anyway. [Person2]:  You ' re welcome. Why don ' t you ask the conductor when he comes by? [Person1]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  Good morning, Madam. Are you being helped? [Person2]:  No, I'm not. [Person1]:  Where? I can certainly help you if you'd like some advice. This skirt and scarves over here are back in style. [Person2]:  Oh, I'm here to look for a winter coat. [Person1]:  How about this one? It's made of very high-quality wool. [Person2]:  It's nice but actually I need something warmer. This would work if I were staying here in Los Angeles. But it's too light for Chicago winter. [Person1]:  Ah, you need a very heavy coat. Then please follow me. This one here is a good value and is one of our warmest coats. It's also quite fashionable and very comfortable. [Person2]:  Would it be possible to get a discount on it? [Person1]:  Maybe we can give you a 5% discount. [Person2]:  OK. I'll take it. [Person1]:  Can interest you in some gloves? They are 10% percent off now. [Person2]:  No, thanks. I used to live in London, so I already have some very nice gloves.
[Person1]:  I can't believe Thanksgiving is right around the corner. Who usually does the cooking in your family? [Person2]:  My mother and my 2 aunts don't let anyone else do anything except for the salad and the drinks, that includes all the sauces, desserts and place settings. [Person1]:  Wow, it sounds like they take Turkey Day pretty seriously. [Person2]:  Listen, if Thanksgiving were an Olympic sport, they would be kicked out for winning too many gold medals. What about you? [Person1]:  Well my parents and I do everything together, it's better than one person trying to do too much.
[Person1]:  Where in Canada are you from Ken? [Person2]:  I'm from Toronto. [Person1]:  Oh, I've never been there. What's it like? [Person2]:  It's a big city, but it's not too big. The nightlife is colorful. I enjoy it. [Person1]:  Is it expensive there? [Person2]:  Yeah, a little bit. [Person1]:  And what's the weather like in Toronto? [Person2]:  Well, it's pretty cold in the winter and very hot and wet in the summer. It's nice in the spring and fall though. You can always see the clear sky then.
[Person1]:  Hey! Can I ask you for a favor? [Person2]:  Sure. [Person1]:  I'm trying to learn how to cook. Eating out so much has really been costing me a lot of money. [Person2]:  That's a good idea. What do you want to make? Shall I teach you how to roast a chicken? [Person1]:  Well, maybe later. Right now I have this pack of eggs. Unfortunately, I have never made eggs before. [Person2]:  What? You don't know how to cook eggs? [Person1]:  No. My mom always made everything for me. That's why I'm asking for your help. [Person2]:  OK, I'll help you. Start by boiling some water, that's the easiest way to cook an egg.
[Person1]:  What's the matter, sir? You look pale. [Person2]:  I feel dizzy and weak. And I'm having this pain in my ear. I think I am sick. [Person1]:  Are you often traveling by plane? [Person2]:  No, this is the second time. [Person1]:  That's right. It's normal if you don't often take the plane. Just relax a little bit. [Person2]:  Why this happens to me when I am on the plane? I feel bad. [Person1]:  Don't worry, sir. It's just because of the lower pressure. [Person2]:  What should I do about it? [Person1]:  You may feel much better if you chew some gum or peanuts. [Person2]:  OK, thanks. Does it work really? I'll give a try. [Person1]:  Are you feeling better now? Do you need some pills? [Person2]:  Much better. Thank you. I just feel tired but I can't fall asleep. [Person1]:  So, you'd better wear this eyeshade and you will sleep well. [Person2]:  I am not used to wearing that. Thanks. [Person1]:  If you try to adapt yourself to your destination's local time, you'll feel more comfortable. So please try to sleep, and have meals according to Los Angeles's time. [Person2]:  Thank you so much.
[Person1]:  Welcome to our hotel's indoor swimming pool. What can I do for you? [Person2]:  You see this is the first time for me to use the swimming pool. I've got no idea about the water temperature of the pool. I'm afraid it might be a little cold. [Person1]:  You don't need to worry about that. madam. We have a warm massage pool, and the temperature is 36  C. [Person2]:  I see. But I'm not a good swimmer. Can you tell me how deep the pool is? [Person1]:  Certainly, madam. The deepest place is two meters but you can swim in the shallow area, which is only l. 4 meter in depth. We have separate locker rooms over there and they are free of charge. [Person2]:  That's great! Can you give me the key to the locker? I can't wait to have a try.

[Person1]:  are you still coming to my place for dinner tomorrow night? [Person2]:  of course. Is the dinner still on? [Person1]:  yes, I was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place. [Person2]:  we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice. [Person1]:  that's what I thought you would do. Listen, I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood. It's just down the street from all the bars. You probably don't want to be walking around after dark. [Person2]:  it can't be that bad. [Person1]:  I wish it wasn't, but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here. [Person2]:  really? I never would have guessed. The criminals must only come out in the evenings, because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime. [Person1]:  do me a favor, and take a taxi. It'd make me feel a lot better. [Person2]:  ok, we will. How do you get around in the evenings? [Person1]:  when I first moved in, I walked everywhere. But within a week, I had my purse stolen, just a block away from the police station! Now, I always take public transportation. [Person2]:  has anything else happened to you? [Person1]:  nothing else has happened to me, but I have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close. [Person2]:  well, we'll be careful. Thanks for letting me know.

[Person1]:  What's your method of learning? [Person2]:  Let me think a minute. I think I always try to take every chance to practice. [Person1]:  What if there is no chance? I mean what if you don't have a partner, what will you do? [Person2]:  Well, I talk to myself. That is, I play one role first, than the other. [Person1]:  That's a good idea. You are really creative.
[Person1]:  Mike, did you win the lottery or something? Why the big smile? [Person2]:  I'm so relieved. I just passed the bar exam. [Person1]:  You did? That's great! You must be very happy now? [Person2]:  That's an understatement. I'm on cloud nine. I couldn't be any happier. [Person1]:  Did you tell your parents yet? [Person2]:  Not yet. I didn't get a hold of them. I'll try to call them again tonight. [Person1]:  They're probably going to be so happy. [Person2]:  I think so. It's turning out to be a great day.
[Person1]:  So what did you think about the movie? [Person2]:  Well, I think this Star Wars episode is an excellent piece of work, but not as good as the previous ones. [Person1]:  Really? I don't agree. This Star Wars episode was incredible! [Person2]:  Why do you think so? [Person1]:  Well, one of the most spectacular things about this one was the special effects. State of the art special effects are the main reason for the success of previous episodes, so audiences have high expectations for this one, and I don't think they will be disappointed. [Person2]:  You are right. The special effects were amazing. And I like the fact that they created so many fantastic settings and otherworldly costumes, weapons and creatures. [Person1]:  It's kind of cool that they are still using the same Star Wars theme song for this movie. [Person2]:  Yeah! It reminds me of the previous Star Wars scenes. [Person1]:  I know exactly what you mean. Hearing that song gives me a nostalgic feeling. [Person2]:  I thought the overall plot of the movie was very interesting, but I don't think the character development was that strong. [Person1]:  Do you think that they had anything to do with the casting of the movie? [Person2]:  No, the casting is great and the actors were excellent. They just didn't have a lot of funny or meaningful dialogues. The writing was also a little weak. [Person1]:  Well, maybe. But I like the little kid who played Manakin Skywalker. I can't imagine anyone else playing that role. [Person2]:  I liked him too. He is so cute! You know, even though I was slightly disappointed, I can't wait for the next episode. I wonder when they're going to start making it and when it's scheduled for release? [Person1]:  I've no idea. But looking at the success of Star Wars episode, I've a strong feeling production for the next episode will be selling pretty soon. I hope It will be even better than this one. [Person2]:  I hope so, too. [Person1]:  Well, I think we should go now. It's getting pretty late. [Person2]:  Okay, let's go!
[Person1]:  Tiffany, why are more and more people turning to the Web to find a mate? [Person2]:  I think that, as more people use the Internet for both work and pleasure, it makes more sense as a tool to connect with people, and the stigma of meeting someone online is reduced. [Person1]:  There are actually special sites for people looking to date within their specific ethnic group and age group. But how should you screen potential mates? Do you suggest talking to them on the phone right away or communicating via e-mail? [Person2]:  I would say do not make the e-mail exchange too long. A lot of times a connection via e-mail creates almost a false sense of intimacy. Quickly make sure there is a connection in the physical world. [Person1]:  Can you give us any other safety tips for people pursuing relationships on the Net? [Person2]:  I'd suggest you not give out too much personal information, like your home address, until after several dates. Just keep up the same guards you would keep up if you were meeting any stranger. [Person1]:  Besides the growth of these matchmaker sites, do you have any stats on success rates? Are people out there finding true and lasting love through the Internet [Person2]:  Well, for a site like ecrush. com, since their debut in Valentine's Day in 1999, of the 1. 5 million people who have joined ecrush. com, 300000 have actually matched. [Person1]:  Do you have any successful stories to share? [Person2]:  Yes, the couple that I highlighted at today's show met on Match. com and they're getting married this summer.
[Person1]:  Happy birthday! This is for you, Kate. [Person2]:  Thanks, Miss. Wang. [Person1]:  You know in China we usually don't open presents until the guests leave. [Person2]:  Really? I've already opened it. Great! And it is exactly after my fancy. Thank you very much.
[Person1]:  I have a sore throat and my chest hurts. [Person2]:  How long have you been like this? [Person1]:  Two or three days now. [Person2]:  I think you've got the flu. There's a lot of it going around. [Person1]:  What do you think I ought to do? [Person2]:  Get this prescription filled and go straight to bed.
[Person1]:  I'd like to change some US dollars into euros and I'd like to know today's exchange rate. [Person2]:  According to today's exchange rate, every US dollar in cash is equivalent to 0. 75 euros. [Person1]:  Is there any service charge? [Person2]:  We charge a 1 euro commission on each deal. How much would you like to change? [Person1]:  400 US dollars. Here it is. Would you please give me small bills? [Person2]:  No problem.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, can you help me? I would like to change rooms if possible, I couldn't sleep at all last night, because the people in the room next to mine were making a lot of noise, also if at all possible, I'd like a room that doesn't overlook the street, between the noisy neighbors and the highway outside, I didn't sleep a wink. [Person2]:  I am so sorry to hear that sir, let me check and see what is available, what room are you in now? [Person1]:  I'm on the 6th floor, room 698, I'v had many problems with that room, just this morning, I called someone up to fix the light fixture in the bathroom, it didn't work, and it still doesn't work. [Person2]:  Oh, dear, well, it looks like we have a few rooms available, can I put you into a room on the 17th floor? It has a balcony and it doesn't face the highway. [Person1]:  Ok, that would be very nice! What do I need to do to transfer? [Person2]:  Let me check you out of your old room, you have to sign here, and acknowledge these changes and also the charges to your previous room. Then I can hook you right up to room 1780. [Person1]:  Mmm, I don't think the charges are right, can you explain them please?
[Person1]:  Hi, darling! I have a one-month vacation saved up. How about a trip to Europe? [Person2]:  I could go for that. But I'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year. [Person1]:  Oh, but I really need to leave this town for a change. Working day after day has worn me out. Do you have any other suggestions? [Person2]:  We should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away. How about the countryside? There must be many interesting places, and we could enjoy the fresh air. [Person1]:  Wonderful! I think that's a great idea How soon until we can make this happen? I can't wait! [Person2]:  Tomorrow I have an appointment with my dentist. What about next Monday? [Person1]:  Perfect. I'II start preparing tomorrow. If we re going to drive, l'II need to fill up the tank. [Person2]:  No need. I think it's still plenty full. Even so, I'd rather travel by bus or train. It would cost much less than driving. Oil prices are soaring nowadays, you know. [Person1]:  We can take the train, that will be faster. I'II book the tickets tomorrow morning. [Person2]:  Great! Oh, one more thing, don't forget to check the weather before we go. I'd hate to get caught in the rain. [Person1]:  No problem. I'm really looking forward to the coming week. [Person2]:  Me, too. Now let's make a list for what we need to with us.
[Person1]:  I love your bracelet. When did you get it?  [Person2]:  I got it a while ago, but I haven't worn it much. You really like it?  [Person1]:  Yeah. It's beautiful. Is it white gold or silver?  [Person2]:  It's white gold.  [Person1]:  Where did you buy it?  [Person2]:  My boyfriend took me to the Shane Co. and he let me pick it out.  [Person1]:  That's so sweet. What was the occasion?  [Person2]:  That's the best part. It wasn't for anything special. He just wanted to buy me something.  [Person1]:  You're so lucky. If he bought you something for no special day, I wonder what he would buy you for your birthday.  [Person2]:  My birthday is coming up. We'll find out pretty soon.  [Person1]:  What do you want?  [Person2]:  I wouldn't mind a necklace. I was at the jewelry shop looking around, and they have a couple of beautiful necklaces I want.  [Person1]:  Why not a ring?  [Person2]:  I don't think I'm ready for a ring from him yet.  [Person1]:  But you're ready for everything else?  [Person2]:  Ahha. 
[Person1]:  So who does he think he is, anyway, I can't believe the way that my boss has been ordering everyone around laterly, I mean, it's now like he is the CEO, or anything.  [Person2]:  Um. . . Actually I am guessing you didn't get the MEMO. Your boss was selected to fill the vacancy in the CEO slot. He actually is the CEO now, or will be, as soon as the official press releases and hoopla is done with.  [Person1]:  Yikes! you are joking, right? I can't believe it. No wonder he is so stressed and bossy lately. I thought he was just being ostentatious by giving orders to people and all the different departments. What big shoes to fill!  [Person2]:  No kidding! When the last CEO left, we were worried about the future of the company.  [Person1]:  What does a CEO do anyway? I know the CEO makes the most money in the company, but what does he actually do?  [Person2]:  He is responsible to the board of directors for everything that happens in the company. He or she must give leadership to all company officers, as CEO is also responsible for providing the guidance of philosophy of the company, and acting as official representative, or face of the company.  [Person1]:  Must be one smart guy. 
[Person1]:  I have lots of friends.  [Person2]:  Really? How many do you have?  [Person1]:  I don't know, maybe one hundred.  [Person2]:  That is a lot of friends. Do you have a best friend?  [Person1]:  Of course. I have lots of best friends.  [Person2]:  How many best friends do you have?  [Person1]:  I think about twenty-five.  [Person2]:  Hmm. I have only one best friend.  [Person1]:  I feel sorry for you.  [Person2]:  I have only a few friends.  [Person1]:  You must be lonely. I will share my friends with you.  [Person2]:  That's very nice of you. 
[Person1]:  Honey, do you have a second?  [Person2]:  Sure! Are you okay? You seem a bit worried. What's on your mind?  [Person1]:  We need to talk.  [Person2]:  Okay. . .  [Person1]:  I've been thinking, and well, I think we need to start seeing other people.  [Person2]:  What? Why? I mean, we've had our ups and downs, and we have the occasional disagreement, but we're happy together, aren't we?  [Person1]:  That's just it, I'm not happy anymore, Tim. It's not you, it's me. I know that I can be hard to deal with, and you are a great guy! You are the type of guythat any woman would kill for!  [Person2]:  So, what are you saying? You're breaking up with me because I'm perfect?  [Person1]:  Tim, you are too good for me. You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy. Oh, I could say that I'll be all you need, but that would be a lie. I know I'd only hurt you, I know I'd only make you cry.  [Person2]:  Baby, come on. Don't do this to me! Whatever it is, we can work it out. Just give me another chance! I know that we can get through this, but we gotta stick together! Don't leave me.  [Person1]:  I can't, Tim. I hope someday you can find some way to understand I'm only doing this for you. I don't really wanna go but, deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do.  [Person2]:  Laura. . .  [Person1]:  Here are your keys. I'll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week. I'm sorry, Tim. I wish you all the best, and I hope that one day we can meet again. I'll always love you. Goodbye. 
[Person1]:  Guess what? I'm going on a holiday to Australia next month. [Person2]:  That's great. [Person1]:  I thought you might be able to give me some ideas about what to do while I'm in Sydney. That's where you come from, isn't it? [Person2]:  That's right, and I wish I was there now instead of here in the cold. [Person1]:  What's the temperature likely to be there? [Person2]:  About 25 degrees. You will absolutely like the warm weather there. So how long are you staying in Sydney? [Person1]:  Only a week. I'm going to spend another 3 weeks touring other parts of Australia. [Person2]:  Then I think you should walk around the rocks. It's the oldest part of the city and always crowded with tourists of all nationalities as well as local people. But cafes and restaurants keep very busy. Whenever I go back to Sydney, I enjoy sitting outdoors with a cup of coffee, watching the people passing by. [Person1]:  That sounds like a good idea. Well, thanks for the suggestion. I'm looking forward to my holiday. [Person2]:  Have a good trip, and call me when you get back to the UK.
[Person1]:  Jane do you have a pen pal? [Person2]:  Yes, I do. Her name is Alice. [Person1]:  Where is she? [Person2]:  In England, but we don't often write to each other because neither of us has much time, we both have a lot of work to do. [Person1]:  Do you know what your pen pals hobbies are? [Person2]:  Yes, she enjoys listening to music. Among school subjects she likes math best. [Person1]:  Are you going to write to her soon? [Person2]:  I'm not sure. I'm pretty busy but I'll write to her when I have time.
[Person1]:  Sally, I have no idea what to buy for Linda's birthday. [Person2]:  Me, neither. Would you like to go shopping with me this afternoon, Mike? [Person1]:  Yes, I'd love to and I can choose a gift for her. [Person2]:  We need to think about what she might like. What are her hobbies? [Person1]:  She likes listening to music, reading books and playing tennis. [Person2]:  Then we can get her some CDs or books. Tennis rackets or tennis shoes are OK, too. [Person1]:  OK. Let's go to the bookstore first and then the department store. [Person2]:  No problem.
[Person1]:  Can I help you Madam? [Person2]:  Yes, it is about some pots you had in your window last week. [Person1]:  Last week? What were they like? [Person2]:  Dark brown color, country style and a sort of flower pattern. [Person1]:  That's strange. I don't recognize any of the ones we had from that description. [Person2]:  Oh, you must know the ones I mean, they were on sale are real bargain reduced to 1/4 of the original price. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw them so I came here again. [Person1]:  I'm afraid the sales are over now Madam. [Person2]:  But my neighbor, Mrs. Cliff told me she saw some here only yesterday. [Person1]:  Oh well Madam, as you know, we were just closing. And perhaps Madam, if you come tomorrow, I could show you everything we have in our range of kitchenware. And there are still one or 2 things on sale. [Person2]:  Oh look that one there. That's the sort of thing I was looking for.
[Person1]:  Something important has just happened at the office, Anna. So I can't meet you for lunch. After all, I'm afraid. [Person2]:  What is it? [Person1]:  I have to meet an important buyer at the airport. [Person2]:  That's really annoying? What about the play tonight? You promise to go with me. I already have my mother take care of our kids. [Person1]:  Yes, darling, I promised, but I'm afraid we'll have to cancel it. [Person2]:  What about Thursday. Could we go then? [Person1]:  I think all the seats will be booked up. And anyway, I'm afraid I won't have time next week. [Person2]:  I've telephoned the theater. The seats aren't all booked up in fact. [Person1]:  Well, as I've just said, I am booked up.
[Person1]:  Hello, I'd like to open an account. [Person2]:  Which account would you like to open? [Person1]:  I'd like to open a savings account. What's the interest rate now? [Person2]:  It is 3.2 %. You may earn a little interest on money. [Person1]:  Is there any minimum deposit for the first time? [Person2]:  Yes, the opening minimum deposit is 1, 000 Yuan. [Person1]:  What about the later deposits? [Person2]:  For the later deposits, you can deposit any you want. Even one Yuan is OK. [Person1]:  OK, that's good. [Person2]:  Your ID, please. [Person1]:  Here you are, a thousand Yuan and my ID. [Person2]:  Wait a moment, please... Here is your bankbook. Keep it well please. [Person1]:  Thanks. I will.
[Person1]:  Would you like to take a look at the menu, sir? [Person2]:  Yes. Thank you. [Person1]:  Would you care for a drink before you order? [Person2]:  A glass of Qingdao beer. [Person1]:  Yes, sir. I'll bring it over. Have you decided what you'd like, sir? [Person2]:  Will you make some recommendation?
[Person1]:  Hey, Shirley! Want to join me for lunch. . . my treat! [Person2]:  Wow! Sure! [Person1]:  I must confess I have an ulterior motive for asking you to lunch. [Person2]:  Oh. . . that's OK. . . as long as you're buying! [Person1]:  I really want to pick your brain about something I've been thinking a lot about. [Person2]:  I'd love to help if I can. [Person1]:  Well, as you know, I have a Bachelor's degree in English literature and that's served me well so far, but I've always wanted to do some post-graduate work. . . maybe even get a Doctorate! [Person2]:  Wow! Just the idea of going back to school fills my head with pain. [Person1]:  But you have a Master's degree. . . hasn't that helped your career? [Person2]:  Yeah, I'd have to say it has. But I'm still paying for it, you know. [Person1]:  I know education is expensive, but it's been my lifelong dream. Call me crazy, but I've always wanted to have that PhD at the end of my name. [Person2]:  Well, getting a Doctorate degree would mean close to a decade of school. Can you afford that? Can you survive that? [Person1]:  I certainly can't afford it, but I'm sure I could find some good student loans. [Person2]:  I think you need to separate the dream of having a PhD from the reality of years of more schooling. It's not as romantic as you might think. [Person1]:  Yeah. . . I keep thinking about what I'll do with a Master's or Doctorate. I love language but I don't think there are a lot of well-paying jobs out there for experts on Shakespeare. [Person2]:  Uh huh, that's for sure. You might find that your only career choice is teaching other graduate students.
[Person1]:  I'm very worried, doctor. I'm afraid that I'm very ill. [Person2]:  Why do you think so? [Person1]:  Because I feel tired all the time, even when I wake up in the morning. I find it very difficult to do any work. I have no appetite. [Person2]:  How do you sleep? [Person1]:  Very badly, doctor. [Person2]:  Are you worried about anything? [Person1]:  Well, yes, I am. I'm worried about my work. I've just taken a new job. I earn a lot of money but it's difficult work. I'm always afraid of making a mistake. [Person2]:  Well, there's nothing much wrong with you. You're under too much pressure.
[Person1]:  Good afternoon, doctor. [Person2]:  Good afternoon, Mrs. Brown. Well, what's wrong with this little boy? [Person1]:  He is my son, Jim. He's got a cough. [Person2]:  How long has he had it? [Person1]:  Ever since last night. [Person2]:  Has he had anything to eat today? [Person1]:  Yes. He had a little milk and an egg this morning. [Person2]:  Well, Mrs. Brown, I think he's caught a cold. [Person1]:  Is it serious? [Person2]:  No, it's nothing serious, but he'd better stay at home and rest. [Person1]:  Thank you very much. [Person2]:  You're welcome.
[Person1]:  Do you still see the people we went to school with? [Person2]:  I did for a while, I suppose, until I left university, but after that not really. [Person1]:  Yeah, I've lost touch with most people as well, but I still see Pat occasionally. [Person2]:  Oh, yes, how's she getting on? [Person1]:  Okay. I suppose but she's had a rough time in the last few years. She got divorced. [Person2]:  What, from Peter? [Person1]:  Oh, of course. You knew him, didn't you? [Person2]:  They seemed very close. What happened? [Person1]:  Yes, they were. Oh, it was all fine until they decided to have children. I think she basically didn't want them, but he did. Well, she had two girls, one after the other, and that meant she had to give up work. [Person2]:  Didn't she like being at home? [Person1]:  I think she liked working better, but she felt she should be at home with the children. [Person2]:  So what happened? [Person1]:  It all happened very quickly. She rang me one day to say that Peter had left home. He had a new girlfriend. It was strange because he seemed so devoted to his children. They got divorced in a few months and he was married three days later. [Person2]:  Did He take the children? [Person1]:  No, that was the amazing thing. He seemed to have lost interest in all of them. [Person2]:  Does Pat work? [Person1]:  Oh, yes, she has to...
[Person1]:  Hello, glad to see you here! [Person2]:  Me, too. How are you going these days? [Person1]:  I'm OK. What are you doing in the library? [Person2]:  Oh, recently I'm curious about British English and American English. So I just come here to get some information. They are really about the same, aren't they? [Person1]:  I don't think so. It seems to me that some of the spellings are different. [Person2]:  Such as? [Person1]:  Words like theater and center end in 're' in England instead of 'er' like we spell them. [Person2]:  Can you think of any more examples? [Person1]:  The word 'color' is another case in point. In fact, many words which end in 'or' in American English are spelled 'our' in British English. [Person2]:  I'm still not convinced. I mean, if someone comes here from England, we can all understand what he's saying. The spelling doesn't really matter that much. [Person1]:  We're not just talking about spelling. There are differences in pronunciation and meaning too. I remember seeing an English movie where the actors kept calling their apartment a flat. Half of the movie was over before I realized what they were talking about. [Person2]:  So there are slight differences in spelling and some vocabulary. [Person1]:  And in pronunciation, too. You aren't going to tell me that you sound like James Simpson. [Person2]:  James Simpson isn't English. He's Scottish. [Person1]:  Okay. Anyway, the pronunciation is different. [Person2]:  So British English and American English are different in many ways, right? [Person1]:  Yes, sure. [Person2]:  But it's not so different that it prevents us from understanding each other. [Person1]:  That's exactly what I mean. [Person2]:  Questions 9 to 12 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[Person1]:  Excuse me! [Person2]:  Yes? [Person1]:  I'm afraid I am lost. I'm looking for the East Town Shopping Mall. [Person2]:  Did you say the Town Hall? [Person1]:  No. The East Town Mall. [Person2]:  The East Mall? You are lost! That isn't anywhere near here! The East Town Mall is over near the airport. [Person1]:  I'm not near the airport now? [Person2]:  Oh, no! You are on the other side of town. Here is what you should do. Turn around and drive two or three miles down this street. When you see a big hospital on your right, turn left. That's Bloomfield Avenue. Are you following me? [Person1]:  Yes, I think so. [Person2]:  OK. Then drive along Bloomfield Avenue and you'll see the airport on the right and the mall is on the left. Okay? [Person1]:  Yes, thanks very much. [Person2]:  Good luck!
[Person1]:  Hi, Victor. How are you?  [Person2]:  Oh, I'm fine.  [Person1]:  So, are you going to go to class tonight?  [Person2]:  Maybe . . . but I don't think so.  [Person1]:  Really? What's the matter?  [Person2]:  I don't know. I'm just feeling a little sad.  [Person1]:  Listen. Come with me to class, and after class we can go out for dinner.  [Person2]:  Now that's a good idea. Thanks a lot, Brian. I'm feeling better already. 
[Person1]:  OK, Mister Taylor. Let's go ahead and begin. First of all. Tell me about your last job. [Person2]:  Well, I worked for 5 years at high tech computers. [Person1]:  Ok, Hi-tech. How about your website writing skills? Oh, we're looking for someone to create and manage our company's website. [Person2]:  Um, website... ... website. Sorry I don't think I've read that book. [Person1]:  Huh? And what about the experience with making flash? [Person2]:  Well, I think sometimes computer flash is... ...  [Person1]:  Ok, Mister Taylor, I think I have all the information I need. [Person2]:  Oh, and I really like computer games, I play them every day. [Person1]:  Ok, Ok, thanks, Mister Taylor you can leave. We'll be in touch.
[Person1]:  Hello, tourist information, what can I do for you? [Person2]:  Hello. I'm phoning about the boat trips on the river D? Can you tell me which days they are? [Person1]:  Sure, they go every Friday and Sunday. [Person2]:  And where does the boat leave from? [Person1]:  You'll find it next to the bridge, it's 10 minutes walk from North Street car park. [Person2]:  Are there several trips a day? [Person1]:  Just one, it starts at 12 [Person2]:  How far up the river will the boat take us? [Person1]:  All the way to Aldford. That's ALDFORD. You get off there and come back through the mountains on a bus. [Person2]:  It sounds nice. Can I get any food on the boat? [Person1]:  Not much, the only sell ice cream and cold drinks, but there are lots of cafes in Aldford. [Person2]:  Can we get tickets on the boat? [Person1]:  Yes, there are $3.95 for adults and $2.75 for children. Come early and get a good seat. [Person2]:  OK. Thank you for your help.
[Person1]:  How are things tonight, Jane? [Person2]:  Very quiet. I'll be ready to go home now, so how do you like working at night? [Person1]:  It's fine. After 3 months without a job, any work is OK with me. [Person2]:  I know what you mean. You must be glad to have a job again. [Person1]:  You'd better believe it. How long have you worked here? [Person2]:  Not very long. I was hired right before Christmas last year. The job is not difficult, but I'd like to find something better. It's hard to make ends meet on this salary. [Person1]:  I know. I've got 2 kids and I'm in debt. Luckily, my wife works, too. The bad thing is, she leaves for work right after I get home. [Person2]:  Oh, that reminds me. My husband asked me to get some bread at the store. I'd better go now. They close at midnight.
[Person1]:  Are you OK, Chuck? You look pale. [Person2]:  I'm fine, Catherine. I just stayed up late last night working on my Chinese. [Person1]:  Oh, poor you. You know what, I found a new way to learn Chinese and it works very well. [Person2]:  You did? Do tell me. I've spent all these months trying to learn something new about it. But I've made little progress. [Person1]:  Sure. I'm learning Chinese through songs. [Person2]:  So you're learning Chinese songs? [Person1]:  You can say that. I can actually sing some of them now. [Person2]:  That's a real achievement. How did you do that? [Person1]:  I start by listening to the song a few times and after several times I am able to follow the singer. [Person2]:  It makes sense. [Person1]:  It does. I've learned some Chinese folk songs this way. They are clearly presented and easy to follow. [Person2]:  Can I join you, Catherine? I do want to have a try. [Person1]:  Why not? I downloaded a beautiful song the other day. We can learn it together now. [Person2]:  Great! Do you think we need a Chinese dictionary? [Person1]:  Yes, just in case we run into new characters. [Person2]:  OK. I will bring it with me.
[Person1]:  So next year, you're going to start A levels, which subject are you going to choose? [Person2]:  I'm surely going to do Spanish because it is my favorite subject and then I'm not really sure. I'd like to do art but I don't know if it's very useful for my career. [Person1]:  What do you want to do? [Person2]:  A journalist, that has been my dream since my childhood, so I guess history or psychology or something is probably more useful for my career. [Person1]:  Do you want to go to university? [Person2]:  Yeah, but I'm not going to start university straight after I leave school. I'm planning to have a gap year, you know, a break from studying for a while. [Person1]:  And what would you like to do in your gap year, any ideas? [Person2]:  I want to travel. I'd like to go to Italy and learn Italian. I don't know if it's really practical, but that's my dream.
[Person1]:  excuse me, could you tell me which line I ' m supposed to stand in to buy bubble wrap and to post a package? [Person2]:  you can buy the bubble wrap here, but you ' ll have to stand in line over here to post your passage. [Person1]:  that ' s a really long line. How long do you think it ' ll take to get through all those people? [Person2]:  it takes about 3 minutes per person, so it ' ll probably be about an hour ' s wait. [Person1]:  can I buy stamps here? [Person2]:  sure. How many would you like? [Person1]:  I need 30 for my Christmas cards. [Person2]:  are you sending them abroad? [Person1]:  twenty of them are going abroad to China and America. [Person2]:  do you have any going anywhere in the EU? If you do, those are less expensive. [Person1]:  no. [Person2]:  ok, here you go. That will be 18 pounds and seventy two pence. [Person1]:  and the bubble wrap? [Person2]:  that ' s another quid. [Person1]:  thanks a lot. You ' Ve been very helpful.
[Person1]:  I'm sure that the boy will become nobody when he grows up. [Person2]:  Be careful of what you say, or you'll have to eat humble pie. [Person1]:  Eat humble pie? Impossible, I'Ve never been wrong in judging boys like him.
[Person1]:  I want to join in the bus tour. [Person2]:  Yes, sir. [Person1]:  Will the bus pick up the tourists from hotels? [Person2]:  Of course. You don't have to come here and we will drop you off at your hotel. [Person1]:  Woo, that's quite convenient.
[Person1]:  Tom, this is Mary Bobbins. She's just come over from sales. [Person2]:  It's nice to meet you! Guess we'll be working together. [Person1]:  Yes, she'll be working closely with you on the marketing end of things. [Person2]:  Good. Well, welcome aboard, Ms, Robbins.
[Person1]:  What are you going to have for breakfast? [Person2]:  I just have some cereal each morning. [Person1]:  You're supposed to always have a hearty breakfast. [Person2]:  I don't always have time to make breakfast. [Person1]:  It's easy to make a quick breakfast. [Person2]:  What do you have for breakfast? [Person1]:  When I need to make a quick breakfast, I just make some oatmeal, toast, and OJ. [Person2]:  That's a good idea. [Person1]:  It's not time consuming at all. [Person2]:  It doesn't take much time to make? [Person1]:  Would you like me to make something? [Person2]:  Why don't you make me some oatmeal and toast?
[Person1]:  If we are to modernize our information processing, manufacturing system and management code, we need to complete our office automation. [Person2]:  Yes, you're right. We have to equip our company with a network of workstations at every office as soon as possible. [Person1]:  Our copying machines are too slow, our telephone system is limited in function, and our offices are not well-equipped for us to work efficiently. To improve the offices for higher efficiency, we have to change all the chairs and some of the desks also, redesign our office so that we may have more space. [Person2]:  Good. We can contact the Tiana Office Furniture Store, and ask them to install computers in our company, deliver new tables and other furniture to match the function of the computers, and to improve our work atmosphere simultaneously.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, do you mind if I sit here? [Person2]:  No, not at all. Go ahead. [Person1]:  Thank you. [Person2]:  Are you going somewhere or meeting someone? [Person1]:  I am on my way to Washington. And you? [Person2]:  I am on my way to San Francisco. [Person1]:  Really? I think San Francisco is probably the most exciting city in the U-S. [Person2]:  So do I. No other city has as many good restaurants or as much good music. [Person1]:  Is San Francisco your hometown? [Person2]:  I am from a very small town in Pennsylvania. I wouldn't want to live there again, either. I don't like to live in a small town very much. [Person1]:  Neither do I. But small towns have their advantages [Person2]:  And friendlier people. You know, I'm beginning to feel homesick. By the way, where are your from? [Person1]:  China. [Person2]:  China? But you speak English like a native speaker. I didn't have any idea. [Person1]:  Oh, excuse me. It's time for my flight. Well, it's been nice talking with you. [Person2]:  You, too. Bye!
[Person1]:  Hi, Steven, take a seat! How are things at work? [Person2]:  It's coming along well, but it is a little delayed. [Person1]:  Can you finish it on time? [Person2]:  I'm pressed for time and I am afraid I need someone to help me. [Person1]:  OK, I will send Beker to help you. We need to get the brochures done and sent them to our clients on Friday without delay. [Person2]:  OK, we promise to do it well.
[Person1]:  Grace, quick. If you don't hurry, we're going to miss the beginning of the kungfu movie. [Person2]:  So what! [Person1]:  Don't you want to watch it? [Person2]:  Not really. I couldn't care less about kungfu movies. [Person1]:  You should have told me earlier. Now I'm going without you.
[Person1]:  Come in, please.  [Person2]:  Good moring, Mrs. Smith.  [Person1]:  Good moring. You are Mr. Sun, aren't you? Take a seat, please.  [Person2]:  Yes, thank you.  [Person1]:  I've noticed from your resume that you majored in accounting at Peking University. Will you please tell me something about your related courses?  [Person2]:  In the first academic year we learned Principles of Accounting, and in the following years we learned Cost Accounting, Commercial Accounting, Industrial Accounting, and Mangagement Accounting.  [Person1]:  Have you taken Accounting for Decision-Making and Control?  [Person2]:  No, we haven't taken such a course, but we have taken a more specialized course for decision making, by the name of Forecasting and Decision-Making.  [Person1]:  From your school report card, I can see you did well in every course. But our advertisement says we need an accountant with practical work experience.  [Person2]:  I forgot to include my experience as an accountant in my resume. In fact, I took a part-time job as an accountant at the Atlantic Trading Company during my second and third school year. I worked three evenings a week there and I did quite well. Here is the recommendation.  [Person1]:  You can speak English fluently but I wonder if you can deal with bookkeeping and accounting in English.  [Person2]:  No problem. The professional English course is just English for Accounting. Moreover, as you know, the Atlantic Trading Company is a Sino-Australian joint venture. When I served part-time there, I became well acquainted with accounting operated in English.  [Person1]:  That sounds fine. Why did you choose to apply to our company?  [Person2]:  I have a relative working as a manager in your manufacturing department. Her name is Liuling. She told me a lot about your company and I became quite interested. I believe I can have a promising career with the development of this company.  [Person1]:  Do you know something about the payment we give to our employees?  [Person2]:  No, can you tell me about it?  [Person1]:  Of course. As for an entry-level accountant, we pay $ 1, 500 a month in the first half year. We have a grading system to evaluate your work. If you have made progress, we will certainly raise your salary. For beginners with a CPA certificate, they can earn at least $ 3, 000 a month.  [Person2]:  I have passed the five courses required by the Chinese CPA Association, but the certificate won't come to hand until next month. How about that?  [Person1]:  I hope you can show me your CPA certificate before we reach a decision by the end of July.  [Person2]:  Thank you, Mrs. Smith. It is really a pleasure talking with you.  [Person1]:  The same for me. We'll keep in touch with you.  [Person2]:  Thank you. Good-bye. 
[Person1]:  Mister Ewing said we should show up at the conference center at 4 o'clock, right? [Person2]:  Yes, he specially asked us not to be late. Some of the people from our East York branch office are coming and he wants to make a good impression on them. How are you getting there? [Person1]:  I was thinking of taking my car but I think I'm just going to take the underground because there is construction on the highway. What about you? [Person2]:  I'll be taking the underground as well. Why don't we go together? I've been to the conference center only once, and I'm not sure if I can find my way around there.
[Person1]:  Sam I think it's time for you to get a summer job. When I was your age, I started working at my pool. I hated it and I didn't have any friends there. However, I saved money and I learned how to work hard. [Person2]:  Mom, I really don't have time to work this summer. I am going to go to summer school and I need to practice skateboarding. Also I want to go to the lake with Jeremy. [Person1]:  Well. How are you going to pay to go to the lake? You are getting too old for us to give you money. You're not a young kid anymore. Also, college is very expensive these days. You should start saving money now. College is only 3 years away. [Person2]:  OK, I'll apply for some jobs this weekend. Can you help me fill out job applications? [Person1]:  Yes, I will help you, you should get an application from the supermarket on Walnut Street. Miss Jacobs told me they are hiring students this summer.
[Person1]:  Do you have anything planned for the summer vacation Tony? [Person2]:  Well, I'll go to the US with the exchange students. What about you Joan? [Person1]:  I'd wanted to go to Singapore to stay with my aunt when the vacation begins. But the headmaster told me I should stay in the school to help the students from the US to choose which family to stay with. And act as their guide when they go sightseeing in Tokyo. [Person2]:  What about your trip to Singapore, then? [Person1]:  Well, I've invited my aunt to come here. Have you decided when to leave? [Person2]:  Yes on July fourth, and will stay there until the end of the month. [Person1]:  Have you found someone to look after your house? [Person2]:  Yes, my cousin will come from Beijing to learn Japanese, he'll live in my house during my absence.
[Person1]:  Hi sir, why did you pull me over? What's wrong? [Person2]:  Are you aware that you drove through a red light? [Person1]:  I ran a red light? [Person2]:  Yes, you did. [Person1]:  I apologize, but I didn't realize that I did. [Person2]:  Weren't you taught that yellow means slow down, not speed up? [Person1]:  I did learn that. [Person2]:  So, then why did you speed up? [Person1]:  I don't know what to tell you. [Person2]:  I'm going to have to write you a ticket. [Person1]:  I understand. [Person2]:  Here you go. Don't do that again. [Person1]:  Thank you sir.
[Person1]:  Hi, Robert. What happened to your face? It looks swollen. [Person2]:  I had to go get a cavity filled today. [Person1]:  Did it hurt? [Person2]:  I don't even wanna talk about it. It killed me! [Person1]:  How long were you in the chair? [Person2]:  It took quite a while, but the worst part was getting numbed. They had to give me 3 shoots. [Person1]:  Well, I guess you've learned a good lesson, huh. You have to take good care of your teeth. [Person2]:  No kidding. Not only can't I stand the pain, but man. . . dentists are expensive. The bill is going to be humungous! [Person1]:  Don't you have a dental insurance? [Person2]:  I do, but it still does not cover everything.
[Person1]:  Let's got out tomorrow night. We can go to a bar and try to find you a girlfriend. [Person2]:  I don't think that's a good idea. I am just not good with approaching someone and starting up a conversation. [Person1]:  Maybe you just need a few pick-up lines, you know, break the ice. [Person2]:  Pick-up lines don't work! [Person1]:  Come on! You can just walk up to a girl and say ' If you were a booger I 'd pick you first. ' [Person2]:  What? Come on! That's just lame! No girl would fall for that! [Person1]:  Fine, then you can say, ' So there you are! I'Ve been looking all over for YOU, the woman of my dreams! ' [Person2]:  That's a good one! I think that's pretty funny. [Person1]:  Yeah, so you make her laugh, you make a fool of yourself a little bit and then you buy her a drink. [Person2]:  Ok, how does this sound, ' I was so enchanted by your beauty that I ran into that wall over there. So I am going to need your name and number for insurance purposes. ' [Person1]:  Nice! Let's go!
[Person1]:  Susan, I am inviting you and Frank to our house warming party this weekend. [Person2]:  A house warming party? [Person1]:  Yes, Deborah and I are going to buy a new home in Woodlawn. [Person2]:  Congratulations! That's wonderful. I bet both of you are quite happy. [Person1]:  Well, we have always dreamed of owning our own home, but real estate in this area is extremely expensive. [Person2]:  I understand. That's why Christopher and I want to find a place in a small town, far from the city. [Person1]:  That's a good idea if you can find employment nearby. [Person2]:  I agree. That's why Christopher is already looking for a job in Maine, or Wisconsin.
[Person1]:  So you said you and Amanda met through a mutual friend. How did it happen? [Person2]:  Well, my roommate was friends with Amanda, so he introduced us. [Person1]:  Did he tell you what she was like first? [Person2]:  Yes, he described her to me, and she sounded like my type.
[Person1]:  I wanna register for this mathematics course. [Person2]:  I'm sorry registration has closed. [Person1]:  Closed? The clerk told me I could come back and register any time during the first week of classes. [Person2]:  Well, that's not possible. The computer's official student account has already been sent to the state. And that's what our budget is based on. Who told you that anyway? [Person1]:  Some woman in here when I tried to register three weeks ago. She said I just had to pay a late fee. [Person2]:  She must have been a part-time worker. They didn't have much training. Why didn't you register then? [Person1]:  She said I couldn't until I had my birth certificate. Here it is. [Person2]:  Huh, that is no reason to demand a birth certificate. We only need to establish residency, you know, a phone bill with your name and address on it would have been fine. [Person1]:  Serious? Only the proof of my address. [Person2]:  Yes, I am afraid she gave you the wrong information. [Person1]:  But it's unfair. [Person2]:  Well, I sympathize with your problem, but, to be honest, I don't think there is any thing anyone can do for you. You were trapped in the system. If you want, you can talk to the director. She will help you if she can. [Person1]:  Great. [Person2]:  Don't get your hopes up.
[Person1]:  Guess what? Paul and Susan are engaged. [Person2]:  Really? When did that happen? [Person1]:  A week ago? They met last summer and now just sink. They will be married soon. [Person2]:  Have they set a date for the wedding? [Person1]:  No, not yet. But Susan says they'd like to get married in November or December. Then they'll go to Hawaii for their honeymoon.
[Person1]:  Mr. Li, the report has been finished. [Person2]:  So fast! Thank you. [Person1]:  You're welcome. This is my duty. Anything else? [Person2]:  Yes, you'd print out the address and telephone number of those guests from your computer, and then send those materials to each business worker. [Person1]:  OK, I'll do it right now. [Person2]:  By the way, to tell them try to persuade those new guests to cooperate with us. Because I found a biggest opponent from this post-trip. [Person1]:  Yes, I get it. [Person2]:  OK, it's no anything. Do what you should do.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, is this personnel division? [Person2]:  Yes. What can I do for you? [Person1]:  I came about your advertisement for a senior production planner. [Person2]:  What's your name? [Person1]:  My name is Li Jean. [Person2]:  You have been in Peking University, hadn't you? [Person1]:  Yes, seven years. [Person2]:  What degree do you have now?  [Person1]:  Master of Marketing Management. [Person2]:  Do you have any experience in this field? [Person1]:  Yes. I worked at AB Company. [Person2]:  Why are you interested in the position? [Person1]:  Because you need a senior production planner who is good at mathematics and fluent in English. I think I am fit for the position. [Person2]:  All right. If we decide to hire you, we'd pay you 5, 000 yuan a month at the start. How do you think about it? [Person1]:  That's very good.
[Person1]:  Our offer is RMB 300 per tape-recorder, F. O. B. Tianjin. [Person2]:  We think the price is too high. [Person1]:  That's the best price we can offer. [Person2]:  We'll have to discuss it with my boss. [Person1]:  We can give you a discount if you order for immediate shipment.
[Person1]:  You want to go get a facial with me today? [Person2]:  Dude, what are you talking about? Only girls do that. [Person1]:  Not at all, guys also get facials, manicures and pedicures. There is nothing wrong with looking after your skin and looking good. [Person2]:  True. So what do they do to you at your beauty spa? [Person1]:  Well, first they exfoliate my face, getting rid of all the dead skin. Then I get a face mask with nutrients that keep my skin healthy and young. Afterwards, they apply some moisturizer and you leave feeling like a million bucks. [Person2]:  That doesn't really sound like something I would be interested in. In any case, I just wash my face every night and use sunscreen during the day. [Person1]:  Well you should come with me one day, I'm sure you'll love it. [Person2]:  Uh. . . no.
[Person1]:  What are you doing, Tom? [Person2]:  I'm writing to my mother. [Person1]:  But you wrote to her only yesterday. [Person2]:  Yes, but I have something new to tell her. [Person1]:  Something new? [Person2]:  Yes. I am telling her I've decided to take up a part-time job as a shop assistant. [Person1]:  What do you mean? You've been working at one nearly three months. Have you been fired by Rogers? [Person2]:  No. My mother doesn't know I have a part-time job. [Person1]:  You mean you didn't tell her before? [Person2]:  No. I didn't want her to worry about my study. [Person1]:  But why are you telling her now? [Person2]:  I don't want her to worry about my life here. You see, I told her that I'd just bought a car in my letter.
[Person1]:  Hey, Jake. Are you ready for your trip? [Person2]:  Well, not really. I still have to buy some clothes. [Person1]:  Well, what's the weather like where you're going? [Person2]:  Well, uh, it's really hot in the summer, so I'm going to buy some shorts, sandals, and a few t-shirts. [Person1]:  What about the rest of the year? [Person2]:  People say that the fall can still be warm until November, so I'm going to buy some jeans and a few casual shirts. [Person1]:  Will you need any warm clothes for the winter? [Person2]:  Well, the weather doesn't get too cold, but it often snows in the mountains, so I'm going to buy a couple of warm sweaters, a jacket, and a hat. I don't have room in my suitcase to pack a coat, so I'm going to wait until I get there and buy it when I really need it. [Person1]:  Are you going to take anything else? [Person2]:  They say it rains cats and dogs in the spring, but again, I'll probably just wait and pick up a raincoat or an umbrella later on. But, I'm going to take a good pair of shoes because I plan on walking to and from school everyday. [Person1]:  Do you need any clothing for formal occasions? [Person2]:  Well, you never know when you might need something on the spur of the moment for a wedding or maybe someone's graduation, or a nice date, so I'll probably take some nice slacks, a dress shirt, and a couple of crazy ties or two. [Person1]:  Um, that makes sense. [Person2]:  And I'll just rent a suit or tuxedo if I need anything more formal. Hey, maybe I'll get married. [Person1]:  You? Married? Hah! [Person2]:  Wait. What are you trying to say? [Person1]:  I just can't imagine you decked out in a tuxedo for any formal occasion. [Person2]:  What?! [Person1]:  I mean, for high school graduation, you wore an old pair of jeans and tennis shoes. [Person2]:  Hey, there was a reason for that, so let me explain. [Person1]:  Yeah, ha, ha. [Person2]:  No, really. You see, it goes like this ...
[Person1]:  When do you leave for holiday? [Person2]:  On the twentieth. We're flying. The flight takes seven and a half hours. [Person1]:  And when are you back? [Person2]:  On the twenty-eighth. I will give you a ring when we're back.
[Person1]:  Let's program your courses. Since you have had English literature, you should take American literature and American prose and fiction. You transcript indicate that your English background is strong, so I don't think you have any problem with it.  [Person2]:  How many credits for each course?  [Person1]:  Three, you also should take two three-credit-course in education department.  [Person2]:  Thank you, sir, I'm sure I will. 
[Person1]:  Johnny, I want to thank you. [Person2]:  What do you mean, Mom? For breaking your best china? [Person1]:  Oh, Johnny, that stuff was dollar store junk. No, I want to thank you for keeping Grandma busy. [Person2]:  Well, it's more like she kept me busy. . . [Person1]:  I know, and normally she's trying to tell me how to clean my house. So, thank you. [Person2]:  Am I back in your good books? [Person1]:  Not only that, but I'm going to buy you that video game after all!
[Person1]:  Karen, do you have a minute? I'd like to ask you about something.  [Person2]:  Sure. What is it?  [Person1]:  I think you can give me some advice. You have worked here longer, and I just want to know what you think.  [Person2]:  I'm glad to help you. But what is it you want to ask about?  [Person1]:  I am worried about the meeting this morning.  [Person2]:  Why? I think the meeting went well.  [Person1]:  Really?  [Person2]:  Yes. But what are you worried about?  [Person1]:  I'm afraid I was too rude.  [Person2]:  Rude? You weren't rude at all, Annie. Why do you think you were rude?  [Person1]:  Well, I maybe talked to Mr. Drummond too directly. I thought I maybe said too much. I don't want him to be angry.  [Person2]:  I understand. But really you weren't rude at all. You said what you thought. I think he appreciates that.  [Person1]:  Really?  [Person2]:  Yes.  [Person1]:  But I am new here, and I'm not sure he is used to that.  [Person2]:  You mean because you are a woman?  [Person1]:  Yes. And he is the president of the company.  [Person2]:  Listen, Annie. You shouldn't worry about Mr. Drummond. He is a very good man to work for. He is not sexist at all. He appreciates people for their ideas. And he is willing to take suggestions from men or women.  [Person1]:  I am very happy to hear that, Karen. It's good to know I'm working in such a company.  [Person2]:  I agree with you on that, Annie. I've worked for Derek Drummond for nine years now. I feel he appreciates his employees for their work, not their gender. I would never change jobs.  [Person1]:  Good. Thank you for telling me this.  [Person2]:  Any time. If you have a good idea, don't be afraid to speak up. This is a company that appreciates initiative. 
[Person1]:  Hi, I think I was supposed to call for my test results today.  [Person2]:  If you go onto our website and put in your password, you can access your test results.  [Person1]:  Are you saying that there weren't any problems?  [Person2]:  I will always have you come in for a discussion if there is a major problem.  [Person1]:  Will I be able to read the results on the website and understand them?  [Person2]:  Yes, if you go there, you can see what each test is about.  [Person1]:  How will I know what the numbers mean?  [Person2]:  You can see your results and how they compare to the normal range.  [Person1]:  How can I see test results from tests I have taken before?  [Person2]:  We put all of your test results up in the same place. Just check the dates for what you need. 
[Person1]:  Hi, I was wondering if you have my test results in.  [Person2]:  I didn't see anything out of the ordinary, but I want you to log onto our website for a printout of all of the details.  [Person1]:  So, basically, I am OK?  [Person2]:  If there were any major problems, I would always notify you by phone to come in.  [Person1]:  What will I learn when I see the results on the website?  [Person2]:  A description of each test is given on the site.  [Person1]:  What will the numbers tell me?  [Person2]:  The website will give you a normal range and then tell you what your results are.  [Person1]:  Are all of my test results on that site?  [Person2]:  Your entire test history is on the site. You can compare your results from other years. 
[Person1]:  Where shall we sit? Look! There are some free seats in the corner.  [Person2]:  The seats by the window are better. It'll be cooler there. And we can see the scene outside. [Person1]:  Okay. What would you like to eat?  [Person2]:  I'm really hungry now. I think I'll have chicken and chips with baked beans. Why don't you have chicken too? [Person1]:  I don't eat meat. It makes me ill. I think I'll have a cheese sandwich instead. [Person2]:  And what about drinks? I think I'll have some mint tea. Would you like some? [Person1]:  No, that's really expensive! It's three dollars sixty cents! I'll have a coffee. It's much cheaper. [Person3]:  Good evening.  [Person2]:  Good evening. We'll have one chicken and chips with baked beans and one cheese sandwich please.  [Person3]:  No problem! What would you like to drink?  [Person1]:  A mint tea and a coffee please. Oh - and please bring me some cream for the coffee.  [Person3]:  Okay. let me repeat your order. One chicken and chips with beans, one cheese sandwich, a mint tea and a coffee with cream. [Person1]:  Yes, thank you!
[Person1]:  Hi I am Jane, pleased to meet you. [Person2]:  Hi Jay. I'm glad to be here for the interview. [Person1]:  Did you have problems finding these place? [Person2]:  Not at all. But the traffic was not easy and it took me hours to find a parking space. [Person1]:  Traffic is always being difficult these days. [Person2]:  It would have been so much easier if a train or a subway line went through here. [Person1]:  Yes, you're definitely right. Well, why don't we start by telling me about your previous work experience?
[Person1]:  This newspaper talks about the problem of an aging population. What's the average lifetime in your country? [Person2]:  About seventy-five years. How about in your country? [Person1]:  About seventy. [Person2]:  I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age to sixty-seven, because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly. [Person1]:  But in that case, people who actually, you know, move box or stand at checking point counter for a living, will have a difficult time getting a job. [Person2]:  But the cost for covering the health care of the elderly are expensive, so this policy is necessary. And we're living longer. [Person1]:  An increase in the retirement age will certainly have a bad effect on the lowest income part of the population. [Person2]:  Perhaps we need to have more babies.
[Person1]:  May I come in, sir? [Person2]:  Yes, please. What can I do for you? [Person1]:  I'd like an application form for a scholarship. [Person2]:  We have not yet received them from the dean's office. You may come back in 2 weeks. [Person1]:  But my parents and I are leaving for London in a week. We won't come for a month. [Person2]:  In that case, you might try to get it from the dean's Office tomorrow. You can call him at 8755456689 after 8 [Person1]:  Thank you, Sir.
[Person1]:  Bill, do you know when did the Chinese begin to celebrate Teachers'Day? [Person2]:  I know the Chinese teachers had their first festival in 1985. [Person1]:  So, it is the 27th Teachers'Day. [Person2]:  What will you do on Teachers'Day? [Person1]:  I am going to send Mr. Li some flowers. What about you? [Person2]:  I intend to invite him to dinner.
[Person1]:  So can you fix it? [Person2]:  I'm sorry sir. This computer is not broken or damaged. It's simply just too old! That's why your programs and applications are running slow. There really isn't much I can do. [Person1]:  What do you mean? I bought this computer just three years ago! [Person2]:  Yes, but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster! [Person1]:  OK, I know where this is going. How much will it cost me to get a new computer? [Person2]:  Well, this desktop over here is our latest model. It has a four gigahertz processor with sixteen gigabytes in RAM and a hard disk with one terabyte. Of course, it includes a mouse, keyboard and desk speakers. [Person1]:  I have no idea what you are talking about. I just want to know if it's good and if I will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time! [Person2]:  This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze! If it does, we'll give you your money back!
[Person1]:  Hello, there. Welcome, and what can we assist you with? [Person2]:  Good morning. I have a Bill of Exchange against Bank Acceptance here. I'd like to discount it. Is that possible here? [Person1]:  Yes, we can do that. We require the original Trading Contract and also the VAT Invoice and the Commodity Delivery Documents. They all need to be in duplicate. [Person2]:  Yes, I've got all that here. [Person1]:  Do you have a copy of the ID card of the person who took care of the legal aspects of this? The Legal Rep, I mean? We also need the Loan Certificate as well. Do you have that? [Person2]:  A copy or the original? I guess you need the original, right? OK, I'll return shortly.
[Person1]:  What does your company do exactly? [Person2]:  We design and assemble a wide range of electric generators for hospitals, hotels anc small factories. We specialise in medium-sized generators but we're hoping to diversify into larger models next year. [Person1]:  And who do you sell to? [Person2]:  We export to Eastern Europe and the Far East. The domestic market accounts for about 40 percent of our total sales.
[Person1]:  Mary, you know I've been thinking about applying for a job in Germany. Well, I've got the details about different jobs and I'd like your opinion about which would be the best one to go for. [Person2]:  Where are the jobs? [Person1]:  One's in Munich, one's in Frankfurt and the other one's in Hamburg. [Person2]:  Munich's supposed to be a very nice place. [Person1]:  Yes it is, and it's also in a beautiful part of Germany, not far from the Alias. [Person2]:  That would be great for the kids--they'd love to be able to go skiing at weekends! [Person1]:  But, one problem with Munich is that it's growing very fast. That means the cost of living will probably be very high. [Person2]:  It's a higher salary than the job in Frankfurt but lower than the one in Hamburg. The Hamburg job has the most responsibility. From the point of view of career progression that would probably be the best job for me. Hamburg's the closest to Britain, too, so it would be easy to come back for long weekends and holidays. [Person1]:  That's right, and there's a regular ferry service which would save quite a bit on fares. [Person2]:  What about the cost of living in Germany as a whole? How does it compare with Britain? [Person1]:  Well, it's definitely higher than over here, but salaries are substantially higher, so we'd certainly be better off than we are now. [Person2]:  And what about accommodation? [Person1]:  Well, actually, flats are much cheaper to rent in towns like Munich, Frankfurt and Hamburg than they are here in London, so we'd be able to afford to live in a nice, spacious flat, I'd think. [Person2]:  Mmm, that'd be nice! And do you know what the cultural facilities are like in these cities? [Person1]:  In fact, they're quite good in all three. But, of course, Munich has an international reputation as a cultural center. [Person2]:  Another thing we'll have to consider, of course, are the educational possibilities. How long would you want to go to Germany for? [Person1]:  I think a maximum of five years. I think working overseas will be good for my career and, of course, it'd be a good experience for you and the kids, too! [Person2]:  So we'd be there long enough to enable John to complete a university course. [Person1]:  Well, yes we would, unless of course he preferred to go to a university in the UK. But, yes, if he did want to go to university in Germany, there'd be no problem as each of those cities have their own universities. Munich, in fact, has the second largest university in Germany. [Person2]:  Well, it seems to me the choice must be between Hamburg and Munch. Hamburg has the advantage of being the closest to Britain, so coming home would be relatively easy and inexpensive. Munich, on the other hand, sounds like the most interesting place from a cultural point of view. [Person1]:  I agree with you. Personally, I favor Munich because it's so near to the Alps. We all like sliding and we could go skiing at weekends in the winter. [Person2]:  I think you're right. I had thought Hamburg might be preferable because it's the closest to Britain. But we'll only be abroad for five years, and if we're going to be away, let's choose the most attractive place we can. [Person1]:  Right. That's agreed. Now all I have to do is get the job!
[Person1]:  have you bought a present for jim's birthday yet?  [Person2]:  no, I haven't. I can't think of anything to get him.  [Person1]:  I'm having the same problem. I want to get something really special. Jim always seem to know exactly what to get people as gifts.  [Person2]:  I know. He bought me that beautiful sweater for my birthday. It was exactly what I wanted. And it fit me perfectly!  [Person1]:  he bought me an iron.  [Person2]:  that doesn't sound like a great present.  [Person1]:  maybe not, but my iron was getting old. In fact, it stopped working the week after jim bought me the new one. It's as if he knew that my old iron would soon stop working!  [Person2]:  let's think. He loves football, doesn't he? I saw signed photographs of famous footballers in a shop near hear. Let's go and have a look. You know which team he supports, don't you?  [Person1]:  yes, I do. Let's go. We should be able to find something suitable. We should get him something old... something historic.  [Person2]:  it'll be an expensive present, but we can share the cost.  [Person1]:  I'll be happy to get him something special, even if it coasts a little extra.  [Person2]:  yes. He always get us special gift. We should repay his kindness. 
[Person1]:  Hi, Lucy, you are very popular with people around you, what are your tricks?  [Person2]:  Thank you for saying so. I don't know, probably because I like sharing my experience and knowledge with them. I think this kind of communication helps to improve our work efficiency and also helps to get along with colleagues.  [Person1]:  Sharing knowledge can be very settled and some second stances. People may think you are telling them how to do their work. If they take it personally, they feel angry at you and even become reluctant to support you at work.  [Person2]:  That is true. Some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way. For example, it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people. To show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off.  [Person1]:  You are quite right. Thank you for sharing your experience with me. I learned a lot.  [Person2]:  You're welcome. 
[Person1]:  So, we're back in class at last. I didn't see you around this summer, Mary. Did you leave Beijing? [Person2]:  Yeah, I told my parents I wanted to escape Beijing's heat. So they asked me to go to Wuhan to help my uncle with his business. [Person1]:  Wuhan? That's even worse. [Person2]:  Actually, I didn't go. I ended up in Xiamen. My uncle moved there at the last minute. And he asked me to stay with him there and help decorate his new apartment. [Person1]:  Did you find anything fun to do there? [Person2]:  Well, I did have some time to go to the beach, of course. [Person1]:  Wasn't it unbearably hot there? [Person2]:  No, it was surprisingly pleasant. [Person1]:  Did you like the food? [Person2]:  It wasn't terrible, but I must say that seafood isn't really my thing. [Person1]:  That's a shame. All that delicious fresh fish and nobody to appreciate it.
[Person1]:  What are you calling about today? [Person2]:  I scheduled a delivery for tomorrow. [Person1]:  Is there a problem? [Person2]:  I would like to reschedule. [Person1]:  That shouldn't be a problem. [Person2]:  Can I have it delivered the day after tomorrow? [Person1]:  So, you want it delivered the day after tomorrow? [Person2]:  Yes, will that be possible? [Person1]:  What time would you like us to deliver it? [Person2]:  Is 2 [Person1]:  Your delivery has been confirmed. [Person2]:  Thank you, and I'm sorry for the change of plans.
[Person1]:  Would you mind telling me your grades in high school? [Person2]:  Of course not. My school record was above average in my class. [Person1]:  Very good. What was your favorite subject in middle school? [Person2]:  English. I've liked English ever since middle school, and then in university, I had some excellent teachers. [Person1]:  How were your scores in university? [Person2]:  They are above 90. I'm in the upper third of my class. I have worked hard at my major subject.
[Person1]:  Shall we share a taxi? [Person2]:  Where are you heading now? [Person1]:  I want to go back to my college on the Huanghe road. It is very close to your house. [Person2]:  Is that the university next to the Teachers'College? [Person1]:  That's the one. [Person2]:  You mean we'll share the taxi? [Person1]:  Yeah. If we share the cab, it'll be cheaper. Besides that your Chinese is better than mine. The drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though I practice my pronunciation carefully. [Person2]:  Well. Don't worry about it, I will be happy to share the taxi with you.
[Person1]:  what can I do for you, sir? [Person2]:  What do we get this morning? [Person1]:  Fruit juice, cake and refreshments and everything. [Person2]:  I'd like to a glass of tomato juice please. [Person1]:  Any serial, sir? [Person2]:  Yes. A dish of cornmeal weight. [Person1]:  And eggs? [Person2]:  Yes. Baked eggs and buttered toast. I like my baker very crazy. [Person1]:  How do you want to your eggs? [Person2]:  Fried, please. [Person1]:  Anything more, sir? [Person2]:  No, that's enough, thank you.
[Person1]:  Hi. How can I help you? [Person2]:  Yeah. I'd like to rent a mid-size car for three days. [Person1]:  Okay. Let me check to see if we have one available. Hmmm. It's doesn't look like we do. We have a couple of economy, compact, and full-size cars available, or a nice minivan. [Person2]:  Well, what is the main difference between these cars? [Person3]:  The main difference is size. The economy car is the smallest, and it seats fewer passengers and can hold less luggage. [Okay.] How many people are with you? [Person2]:  Just me and my son. [Person1]:  Well, the economy car would work. We have one right out front. [Person2]:  Where? That one? It looks more like a shoebox to me. I'm really tall and trying squeeze into that thing ... I don't think so. [Person1]:  Well, if you need more room or comfort, I recommend the full-size car. It also has a nice stereo system, CD player, [Alright] safety rear door locks, and cruise control, and power locks and windows. [Person2]:  Well, I'm not so concerned about how it's equipped. I just want to make sure it is comfortable to drive. And what is the daily rate for that anyway? [Person1]:  Well, let's see here. Oh, yeah. It'll come to fifty-seven ninety-five a day. [Person2]:  Wow, a little expensive. But what's the cost for mileage? [Person1]:  Hey, all of our cars have unlimited miles, but of course, that doesn't include gas. [Person2]:  Yeah, right. I bet that car probably eats up gas, and now that were in the middle of the vacation season, gas stations are gouging consumers with astronomical prices. [Person1]:  Well, as they say, it comes down to the law of supply an demand. [Person2]:  Well, anyway, can you install a car seat in one of those cars? I have a 3-year-old son with me. [Person1]:  Sure, and that'll only be one dollar extra per day. [Person2]:  I'll go with the full-size car. Wait, uh ... what does it look like? [Person1]:  Uh, it's right out there in the parking lot. [Which one?] The one over there next to the sidewalk. [Person2]:  Do you mean that old lemon with the missing hubcap? Ahhh. [Person1]:  Sir, excuse me. We take pride in our vehicles. It's just that it's one of the last cars on our lot, but it runs like a dream. Don't let the exterior fool you. Hey, I'll even give you an extra fifteen dollars off the daily rate to show you we are serious about pleasing our customers. Will there be any other drivers? [Person2]:  No, I'm the only driver. [Person1]:  Okay. Would you like to purchase our daily car protection plan? [Person2]:  What's that exactly? [Person1]:  Well, the car protection plan is a complete insurance package covering damage to the vehicle, [Okay] injury or loss of life to you or your passengers [Oh]. It even includes incidental road damage caused by, let's say, a huge boulder rolling down the mountain and crushing your car. [Oh, uh, well ... ]. However, it won't cover loss of property due to theft. Too much crime in the area anyway. [What? Wh ... What about this crime? What, what?]. Don't worry about it. And the car protection plan is only seventeen ninety-five per day. [But you were saying?] And the nicest thing about this coverage is that you can rent the car without the worry and hassle of making a complicated claim in case you do have a problem. [Person2]:  But wouldn't my own car insurance cover those problems? [Person1]:  It might, but each insurance policy is different. With our car protection plan, however, you deal directly with us in case there is a problem [Well ... ], and we handle everything quickly, and you don't have to contact your own insurance company. Okay. Let me just confirm this. A full-size car with a car seat for three days [Yeah], plus the car protection package. Is that right? [That's right.] Okay, I'll have our mechanic, Louie, check the car over and pull it up to the door. [Person2]:  Push it up to the door? I hope this car really runs. [Person1]:  Well, in case it does break down on some out-of-the-way, deserted road, just call the toll-free number for assistance. They'll come to assist you within ... two business days. [Two business days!!!] Enjoy your trip.
[Person1]:  Hi, Francis, I want a new apartment. Are there any near you? [Person2]:  Why do you want another apartment? [Person1]:  The man who lives upstairs plays music all night and I can't fall asleep. [Person2]:  What kind of apartment do you want? [Person1]:  Not a big one. One bedroom is fine. [Person2]:  Do you mind having a roommate? [Person1]:  No, I can live with a roommate. Why? [Person2]:  My brother wants a roommate. Why don't you phone him? [Person1]:  Does he live near the ocean? [Person2]:  Yes, he does.
[Person1]:  Did you take notes in math class? If so, can I borrow them? I wasn't there because I was at an amusement park. [Person2]:  I do have some notes, but I am reading them right now. Maybe you should ask another one for help.
[Person1]:  What's wrong, Peter? [Person2]:  Can you believe this? I locked my keys in the car and I have to go to the airport to pick up my aunt. [Person1]:  So, what are you going to do? [Person2]:  I don't know. Do you think I could borrow your car for a few hours? [Person1]:  I'm sorry, but I really need it this afternoon. [Person2]:  Well, could you drive me home then? I have spare keys there. [Person1]:  That's no problem. [Person2]:  Do you have a quarter for the phone? My wallet's in the car, too. [Person1]:  Here you are. Anything else? [Person2]:  No, that's it. I really appreciate it.
[Person1]:  May I take your order now?  [Person2]:  Yes, bring me a bottle of wine and filet steak.  [Person1]:  Do you want some salad dressing?  [Person2]:  Yes, what kind do you have?  [Person1]:  We have Italian, French, thousand island and blue cheese.  [Person2]:  I think French will be fine. 
[Person1]:  Good morning, sir. May I help you?  [Person2]:  It's our anniversary today. I am looking for the same flowers as the ones in her wedding bouquet.  [Person1]:  What do they look like?  [Person2]:  White.  [Person1]:  How tall are they?  [Person2]:  They are short, I guess. About the same height as those short flowers over there.  [Person1]:  Do they look like roses?  [Person2]:  No, they look like little bells.  [Person1]:  Oh, lilies of the valley. No, I am sorry. We are all out of them right now.  [Person2]:  Oh, that's too bad.  [Person1]:  What about roses?  [Person2]:  Ok. How many do you suggest?  [Person1]:  As many as you like, sir. They are beautiful, aren't they?  [Person2]:  Yes, they are. 
[Person1]:  Jack, what's wrong? You are not in a good mood. [Person2]:  My boss told me not to go to work again. [Person1]:  Why? [Person2]:  I made a huge mistake at work yesterday. I wouldn't have made that mistake if I had been more careful. [Person1]:  You are always careless. So what's your plan now? [Person2]:  I must find a new job as soon as possible. [Person1]:  But I think you should learn to be more careful before you find a new job, or you will make the same mistake again. [Person2]:  I guess you are right. So did you have a good time last night? [Person1]:  Yes, we played music and danced. But Susan didn't look very happy. [Person2]:  You wouldn't be happy either, if it were your thirtieth birthday. [Person1]:  Yes, you are right. No one wants to get old.
[Person1]:  Can you tell me the differences between a letter and a memorandum, Miss Thong? [Person2]:  Certainly. A letter must be sent out of the company and must be mailed or posted. A memorandum is a communication within an organization. [Person1]:  Should we use the layout we use for a letter when we write a memorandum? [Person2]:  No, not necessary. Usually we have a set form which is printed. We just fill in the printed forms and send it to the person or the offices concerned in the company. [Person1]:  Of course, let me find one for you.
[Person1]:  What do you think of this dress? Do you think it suits me? [Person2]:  Sure. Why don ' t you try it on? The fitting room is over there. [Person1]:  It ' s just the right size-a perfect fit! Have you seen anything you like? [Person2]:  I ' m thinking about buying this sweater. I know it ' s June now, but it will be perfect for autumn and winter. [Person1]:  It looks too big for you, but I like the color and the material is good quality. Is it on sale? [Person2]:  Yes, it ' s half price. It ' s supposed to be too large--that ' s the fashion. [Person1]:  I might get one too, but in a different color. I prefer light blue to white. [Person2]:  There.It looks great, don ' t you think? I ' m going to get these jeans as well. I need a new pair. I ' m also going to buy this scarf ready for winter. [Person1]:  I ' m getting this beret? Doesn ' t it look cool? I ' d like to get some jeans too, but I don ' t have enough cash on me. [Person2]:  Don ' t worry. I ' Ve got my credit card. You can pay me back later. [Person1]:  Thanks! Now I don ' t need to come back to the shop a second time.
[Person1]:  Can you type, Jane? [Person2]:  Yes, I can. [Person1]:  How many words a minute? [Person2]:  About 100 words a minute. [Person1]:  En. . . and can you speak any foreign languages? [Person2]:  Yes, I can speak Spanish, and I can also speak Chinese. [Person1]:  Really? that's very good. What about French? [Person2]:  No, I can't speak French. But I can speak Italian, not very well though. [Person1]:  . . . Can you start next week? [Person2]:  Next week? [Person1]:  Yes, on Monday. [Person2]:  You mean I have the job? [Person1]:  Yes, that's right, you have the job now.
[Person1]:  Hello. Welcome! [Person2]:  Hello. I'd like to have my nails manicured. [Person1]:  This way please. We offer multiple manicure services here. Do you want a full service? [Person2]:  I don't need the full service. [Person1]:  But the full service will make your nails look much prettier and it is on discount now. [Person2]:  No, thanks. All I need is painting and polishing. [Person1]:  OK. Please sit down. I hope you will be satisfied with our service. [Person2]:  Thanks very much.
[Person1]:  I'm moving out. [Person2]:  Your lease isn't up yet. [Person1]:  I won't be able to stay here anymore. [Person2]:  That's going to be a problem. [Person1]:  I don't know why there's a problem. [Person2]:  It's a problem because I can't give you your deposit back. [Person1]:  Why can't you give it back to me? [Person2]:  You're breaking our contract. [Person1]:  I'm going to need my deposit back. [Person2]:  That's not going to happen. [Person1]:  I can't stay here, though. [Person2]:  That's really not my problem.
[Person1]:  Could you show me how to operate this fax machine? I am going to receive some urgent fax from a company. [Person2]:  Of course. Let me check it. Firstly, don't be frustrated about all the buttons on it. [Person1]:  That's right. [Person2]:  After overcoming these buttons, you should check whether there is any paper in the machine, you must make sure this. [Person1]:  I couldn't agree more. [Person2]:  And then prepare what you want to receive. If you want to send a photograph, you must copy one. [Person1]:  What can I do next? [Person2]:  The next thing you should do is to wait. The sender will give you the fax. [Person1]:  Look. Some of the faxes come through blurred. What is wrong with it? [Person2]:  Maybe we should call its after-service man.
[Person1]:  Sometimes you look like brains, and sometimes you are simple a Barbie Doll. [Person2]:  I don't know whether I am a Barbie Doll or you are one. [Person1]:  Maybe I am a Barbie Doll, but I won't do Barbie Doll things. [Person2]:  Well, I am not going to flog a dead horse. Let get down to our brass tasks and tidy these things up.
[Person1]:  I am checking out. Here is the key to my room. [Person2]:  Thank you. I'll just print out your receipt, and then you're free to go. Here you go! [Person1]:  Thanks. [Person2]:  If you don't mind me asking, how did you enjoy your stay at New York Hotel? [Person1]:  This hotel could use some insecticide, but my time in New York was thoroughly delightful. [Person2]:  That's very honest of you. Rest assured that this hotel will have no insects next time.
[Person1]:  Have you decided what you are going to take next semester?  [Person2]:  Well, I'm an English major, you know. So I came here to make sure I'm taking the right things.  [Person1]:  Good. I think it's a good idea. Our department should require meetings like this.  [Person2]:  I want to finish my degree in four years. So I don't want to forget to take classes I need. I have a friend who has to stay in college another year. She didn't know until recently . There were some classes she needed to take to graduate. She didn't know about them.  [Person1]:  Yes, that happens.  [Person2]:  I brought my transcript from my first year. Here. And here is the list of courses I plan to take in the fall.  [Person1]:  Alright. Good. I see you've already taken six credits of your breadth requirements. You have one botany class and one chemistry class. And political science. So that's nine credits. Did you take English Composition 201?  [Person2]:  No, I don't need to. I took Advanced Placement English in high school. So I'm not required to take composition.  [Person1]:  Excellent. I see you have the 18th century poetry class for next semester. And the modern novel class. You haven't taken a Shakespeare class yet.  [Person2]:  No, I thought I would take it later.  [Person1]:  Actually, I recommend you take Shakespeare sooner rather than later.  [Person2]:  Well, I suppose I could cross out the 18th century poetry class. I have to see when the Shakespeare class meets.  [Person1]:  Let me look at the timetable. Shakespeare meets Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 11  [Person2]:  I can take it then. I have that time slot free.  [Person1]:  Good. I recommend it. Shakespeare is of course enormously important. We want our students to take the class as soon as they can. And Professor Friedman is an excellent teacher.  [Person2]:  I'll take it then.  [Person1]:  Tell me, Lisa, what made you decide to be an English major?  [Person2]:  I want to be an English professor in the future. I love studying literature, and I want to teach it.  [Person1]:  Really? That's great to know.  [Person2]:  That's the reason I want to finish my B. A. in four years. Because I know I will be in school a long time. I want to start the M. A. and Ph. D. program as soon as possible. 
[Person1]:  How many people are traveling with you today, miss? [Person2]:  Just me. I'm traveling alone. [Person1]:  And how many bags do you have? [Person2]:  Just one carry-on and one that I want to check. [Person1]:  You must be going to some island to relax in the sun where all you need is a swim suit and a toothbrush. [Person2]:  That's right. [Person1]:  Well, you have fun. [Person2]:  I will have fun.
[Person1]:  Let me suggest this one. It's an excellent watch, it looks good, and it's only $ 100. [Person2]:  Hmm. That's not too bad. Does it have a stopwatch? [Person1]:  Uh, no. Analog watches don't come with stopwatches. You'll have to get a digital if you want a stopwatch. [Person2]:  Oh. I see. Where are your digital watches? [Person1]:  Right here. [Person2]:  I don't like this kind as much. Never mind the stopwatch then. I'll take that other one. Do you take checks? [Person1]:  Yes. Make it out to Time After Time. [Person2]:  Here you are. [Person1]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  To get around your difficulty, Mr. Smith. I'd suggest that you reduce your order by half. You can send in an additional order later. [Person2]:  Well, I'll consider the possibility. By the way, when do I have to open the L / C if I want the goods to be delivered in June. [Person1]:  A month before the time you want the goods to be delivered. [Person2]:  Could you possibly effect shipment more promptly? [Person1]:  Getting the goods ready, making out the documents and booking the shipping space, all this takes time you know. You cannot expect us to make delivery in less than a month. [Person2]:  Very well, Mr. Zhang. I'll not reduce my order. I'll take the full quantity you offer. And I'll arrange for the L / C to be opened in your favor as soon as I get home. [Person1]:  When will that be? [Person2]:  Early next month. In the meantime, I should be very pleased if you would get everything ready. I hope that the goods can be dispatched promptly after you get my L / C. [Person1]:  You can rest assured of that.
[Person1]:  First of all, thank you for accepting this job. [Person2]:  It's my pleasure. [Person1]:  What are your salary expectations? [Person2]:  Would you please tell me about your pay skill first? [Person1]:  We'll offer you a monthly salary to begin with, in addition, we offer one percent commission and all your sales. You also enjoy life insurance and health insurance. What's starting salary would you expect here? [Person2]:  They sum my skills and experience. I'd like to start it with 4000 yuan a month. [Person1]:  That sounds reasonable. [Person2]:  Do I have paid vacation? [Person1]:  Yes, you have 2 weeks paid vacation a year, and you get it additional week after 4 years, and then again, after 9 years if you decide to stay that long, we promote from within based on performance, so there is an excellent chance that you could become a sales manager or even a region manager.
[Person1]:  Good morning, sir. May I help you? [Person2]:  Yes, would you please find a room for our business meeting? [Person1]:  Certainly, sir. How many people do you have? [Person2]:  Well, about 10. [Person1]:  Fine. We have a conference room which can seat up to 20 people. [Person2]:  That's great. What about the charge? [Person1]:  It is 90 RMB per hour. There is no minimum charge. Do you want to book it? [Person2]:  Yes, I think so. [Person1]:  May I have your name and room number, please, sir? [Person2]:  Mr. Black, Room 1208. [Person1]:  Thank you, Mr. Black. How long will you be using the conference room? [Person2]:  We'll start at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning but I'm not sure when we'll finish. [Person1]:  No problem, Mr. Black. The room will be at your disposal then.
[Person1]:  Today, we have Professor McKay on our morning talk show. Good morning, Professor McKay. I've heard that you and your team have just completed a report on old age. [Person2]:  That's right. Well, the report basically look into the various beliefs that people hold about old age and tries to prove them. [Person1]:  And what do you think your report can achieve? [Person2]:  We hope that it will somehow help people to change their feelings about old age. The problem is that far too many of us believe that most old people are poor, lonely, and unhappy. As a result, we tend to find old people, as a group, unattractive. And this is very dangerous for our society. [Person1]:  But surely we cannot escape the fact that many old people are lonely and many are sick. [Person2]:  No, we can't. But we must also remember that the proportion of such people is no greater among the 60-70 age group than among the 50-60 age group. [Person1]:  In other words, there is no more mental illness, for example, among the 60s-70s than among the 50s-60s. [Person2]:  Right! [Person1]:  Are people's mental abilities affected by old age? [Person2]:  Certain changes do take place as we grow older, but this happens throughout life. These changes are very gradual and happen at different times with different people, but, in general, if you know a person well in his middle age and have seen how he deals with events and problems, you will easily recognize him in an old age. [Person1]:  So that someone who enjoys new experiences, travel, education, and so on in his middle years will usually continue to do so into old age? [Person2]:  Exactly.
[Person1]:  Did you hear what's going on downtown today? All the workers from the factory are staging a demonstration in the streets. Not one of the two thousand employees showed up for work today, and they have gathered outside the city hall to demand better working conditions for all factory employees. [Person2]:  Wow, sounds chaotic. . . . two thousand people in the streets carrying picket signs and shouting slogans. What gave them the motivation to finally organize and call management on the substandard working conditions?  [Person1]:  I think they gained courage after the mayor's speech last week on equality and opportunity for all town citizens. Anyway, the sentiments have been brewing for quite some time. I mean, we all know the working conditions at the factory are quite horrendous.  [Person2]:  So what kind of demands do they have? What are they asking for specifically?  [Person1]:  They want raises and medical insurance, and I think they want to clean up the factory's safety hazards. That's probably the most important issue. 
[Person1]:  Ben, come here! I'm having trouble picking out a dress for tonight. How about this silver one? [Person2]:  I don't think you need to wear something about fancy. [Person1]:  You're right. It's not that comfortable and we're going to be dancing a lot in the concert. [Person2]:  Why don't we go to the mall and get you something? It's your birthday next week. [Person1]:  I have enough clothes. Here, look! This is black, so it matches my shoes. [Person2]:  There are 3 long tears down the back. It looks like you got attacked by a tiger. [Person1]:  That's the style. Besides, I'm not going to be the only one with holes in my clothing there. I'll fit right in. [Person2]:  You make a good point.
[Person1]:  Owen, how was the basketball match last night? [Person2]:  I don't know personally, but I heard it was very good. [Person1]:  What? You didn't go? I know you had a ticket. [Person2]:  Right, but Ted, one of my colleagues, was really interested in the match. He asked if he could have my ticket. [Person1]:  Couldn't he buy one himself? [Person2]:  No, by the time he heard about the match. It was too late. All the tickets had been booked. [Person1]:  But didn't you want to go? [Person2]:  Yes, but not as much as Ted, besides Susan asked me to go to a movie with her. [Person1]:  Of course, your girlfriend is more important. So did you watch the match on TV? [Person2]:  No, it wasn't broadcast on TV. But Ted took some photos, and he'll show them to me next week.
[Person1]:  Hello, Mister Brown. I need to ask a writer some questions for my homework. Could you spare a few minutes for me? [Person2]:  Sure. Go ahead. [Person1]:  Thanks. So how old were you when you realized you loved writing? [Person2]:  It was when I was 10 years old. I was reading short stories and then I decided to try writing a short story myself. After I finished it, I realized I really loved writing. [Person1]:  So what was your first book about? [Person2]:  It's about a man in a cat's body. Kids loved it after it came out. [Person1]:  Are all your books for kids? [Person2]:  By far, yes. But I'm planning on a book for adults. [Person1]:  What is it about? [Person2]:  It's about a woman who has got tired of her life with her husband. I can't tell you more. I want to keep it a secret before it comes out. [Person1]:  OK. Thanks, Mister Brown. [Person2]:  You're quite welcome.
[Person1]:  You asked Beth to be here around 7 [Person2]:  Yes, what time is it now? [Person1]:  It's almost 8.I wonder what happened? [Person2]:  Um, she might have forgotten the time. Why don't I call and see if she's on her way. 'A few minutes later.', I got her voicemail so she must not have turned on her cellphone. [Person1]:  I hope she didn't have a problem on the road. Her car could have broken down or something. [Person2]:  Of course she may have simply forgotten and done something else today. [Person1]:  No, she couldn't have forgotten. I just talked to her about it yesterday. I guess we should start to order without her.
[Person1]:  Let me tell you some more. The interest is settled on the 20th of the last month in each quarter, It's paid quarterly. Of course it also needs to be settled if you cancel the account. [Person2]:  Miao Ping, in your opinion, should we go for the Type A or Type B Account? [Person1]:  Well, the Type B Account is very restricted. If your aim is to use the account the same way as your use your Settlement Account, I would recommend the Type A Account for you. [Person2]:  Thanks for your time. I'll go and discuss everything with my partner and I'll be back later.
[Person1]:  Are you interested in history? [Person2]:  Yes, I am. I enjoyed studying it at school, though I had trouble remembering all the dates, so my teacher never gave me good marks. [Person1]:  I love history, but I ' Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened. [Person2]:  I wish you had been my history teacher! I might have got better marks! [Person1]:  Some people say that history repeats itself. [Person2]:  What does that mean? The same events never happen twice, do they? [Person1]:  The idea is that the people and dates change, but the reason why things happen stay the same. [Person2]:  I see. I think I ' d agree with that statement. People often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again.
[Person1]:  How was the movie last night? [Person2]:  I didn't really like it. [Person1]:  Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography. [Person2]:  I found it very disappointing. [Person1]:  She liked the acting, too, because that's what she wanted to see. [Person2]:  I wasn't happy with it. [Person1]:  Nothing is to your satisfaction.
[Person1]:  Are you going to eat anything with your sandwich? [Person2]:  I may get some fruit. [Person1]:  Oh really, what kind of fruit do you like? [Person2]:  I tend to only eat grapes and apples. [Person1]:  What kind of apples do you prefer? [Person2]:  I've always liked green apples. [Person1]:  I don't really like green apples that much. [Person2]:  Why do you say that? [Person1]:  I think they are too sour. [Person2]:  You'd rather eat a red apple? [Person1]:  Don't you like red apples? [Person2]:  They're okay, I guess.
[Person1]:  Jim, how was your weekend? [Person2]:  I went to the beach with my friends and had a barbecue there. [Person1]:  That sounds like a lot of fun. Did you go swimming, too? [Person2]:  Sure. I think it's a fantastic place to go. [Person1]:  I couldn't agree more. That's an ideal place for a vacation. [Person2]:  It sure is. [Person1]:  I can't wait to go there myself.
[Person1]:  Have you figured out where you want to transfer to? [Person2]:  I can't think of where to go. [Person1]:  Where would you like to go to school? [Person2]:  I really don't know. [Person1]:  You can't think of anything? [Person2]:  I really like where I'm at now. [Person1]:  So, why don't you just stay here? [Person2]:  That may be what I'm going to do. [Person1]:  It's a perfectly good school. [Person2]:  You're absolutely right. [Person1]:  Do you know what you're going to do now? [Person2]:  I'm just going to stay at PCC.
[Person1]:  Tristan, could you stay a few extra minutes to discuss your project with me? [Person2]:  Sure. We're on a pretty tight schedule, but we should be able to finish it just on time. [Person1]:  Are all of your team members on schedule? [Person2]:  A few of the graphic designers are a bit behind in their work because of computer problems. [Person1]:  How have they decided to deal with that? [Person2]:  They've agreed to work over-time until it's finished. They've even decided to come in on the weekend. [Person1]:  That's true dedication. I'm impressed. When is it due? [Person2]:  We agreed that the deadline was next Friday. [Person1]:  Right. Well, given that your colleagues are working so hard on this project, I suppose we could change that deadline to Monday morning, I won't have time to look over it on the weekend anyway. [Person2]:  That'd be very helpful. An extra weekend is all they really need. Thanks. [Person1]:  That's alright. Make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the new deadline. [Person2]:  I will. [Person1]:  I know you have a tight schedule, so I won't take up more of your time. Have a good evening. [Person2]:  You, too! See you tomorrow.
[Person1]:  Mary, have you ever wondered why some cultures have more proverbs than others? For example, the Mayans, the Incas, and the North American Indian tribes seem to have fewer proverbs than cultures like, the Arabians, and the Chinese. I wonder why this is. [Person2]:  What would you say about our ... our own culture? Would you say we're a culture that's rich in proverbs or one that lacks proverbs? [Person1]:  I think we, we have a rich heritage of proverbs - the Benjamin Franklin maxims, proverbs, wise sayings have been handed down to us. [Person2]:  Well, I think the fact that we're no longer creating proverbs today maybe says something ... maybe perhaps explains to some extent why proverbs in certain cultures were not as extended or extensive as in other cultures. [Person1]:  Mm, hmm. That's true. I wonder why we are not creating as many proverbs as we did in 1700s and 1800s. I agree with you. I don't think there are nearly as many. I can't think of any. I'm sure there are some, but I wonder why this is so. [Person2]:  Yeah, well, I think we all know a great many proverbs. If we sit down, we can think of some that we can ... we can list. But we don't seem to use them to explain things. We find many times that they're used too much and too simple - too general. Today we're much more sophisticated, you might say, and analytical, and therefore we don't use proverbs to explain things the way, say, our grandfathers and parents did. [Person1]:  Life is too complicated now to just quote a simple proverb to take care of things. [Person2]:  Right, and maybe to some extent that's why the North American Indians and the Mayans among others don't have as many proverbs. At least there's no record of as many proverbs. Since their own culture ... their traditions were highly eroded and they were wiped out during this era of change. [Person1]:  Well, that's interesting.
[Person1]:  Peter, where is the ear? I haven't seen you drive to work for a long time! Is it broken or stolen? [Person2]:  Hi, Susan] Oh, no! Of course not! I give up driving to work. Instead, I ride to my working place. [Person1]:  Why is that? [Person2]:  You see. There is only a stone's throw from my home to my working place. I think riding a bike to work is more convenient. [Person1]:  I don't think so. It will take you at least 25 minutes to get to our company from here. [Person2]:  Yes, sometimes, 30 minutes. But I love riding to work now. It is a totally different picture on my way to work. [Person1]:  Why do you think so? [Person2]:  You see, every morning, after I set off for work, I can breathe the new fresh air along the way. By the time I reach my office, I feel rather revived. I even don't rely on coffee to spend my morning hours. [Person1]:  Is it so magical? [Person2]:  At least, that's how I feel about riding to work. I can't believe I have wasted so much fresh morning air in the past 3 years! [Person1]:  Will you continue riding to work in the future? [Person2]:  I think so.
[Person1]:  OK, what are we going to make tonight? [Person2]:  We're having noodles and meatballs, your favorite. Are you really going to help me? [Person1]:  Of course, I promised you I would. You've been working a lot lately and taking care of the kids on top of that. I really want to help out. [Person2]:  Thanks so much, Patrick. That means a lot to me. [Person1]:  No problem. So what do we do first? [Person2]:  First, I'll start boiling the water for the noodles. Why don't you get the ingredients out to make the meatballs? And last we'll make the sauce. [Person1]:  OK, great. This is fun. We should do this more often. How did the meatballs look? [Person2]:  They look great. I know you don't usually help out in the kitchen, because you feel uncomfortable. But you're a great chef, a real natural.
[Person1]:  Did you hear about the robbery? [Person2]:  Did I hear about it? I saw it happen. [Person1]:  Are you serious? [Person2]:  I was there. [Person1]:  What happened? [Person2]:  A man came into the bank with a gun. [Person1]:  That's insane. [Person2]:  I was so scared when I saw the gun. [Person1]:  Then what happened? [Person2]:  He took the money and tried to get away. [Person1]:  Did the cops show up in time? [Person2]:  He didn't even make it out the door.
[Person1]:  I'm planning to buy a bicycle. As you are quite a cycling enthusiast, I wish you might give me some advice. [Person2]:  With pleasure, chap. But before I start, I need to know what you want a bike for? [Person1]:  My purposes are two-fold. On the one hand, I've grown bored of commuting on suffocating buses every day and decided to ride to work. On the other hand, bicycling is a sport, and I intend to build up my body through constantly taking a ride over the weekends. [Person2]:  Cycling during weekends? Do you like riding on the mountainous countryside just the neighboring towns? [Person1]:  Does that make any difference? [Person2]:  Can't be greater. If you ride on bumpy, hilly roads, a mountain bike is what you need. But if you just ride comfortably along the city lanes, you might choose a road bike. [Person1]:  Are they designed differently? [Person2]:  A road bike features skinny tires and a light-weight frame. Its riding position puts you bent over the handlebars. It's not particularly beefy in construction, and generally, it won't stand up well under heavy loads or on really rough surfaces. In contrast, mountain bikes have wide tires and a stout frame. You sit higher on them and don't have to hunched over.
[Person1]:  do you have any plans for Friday night? [Person2]:  I don't think so. Why? [Person1]:  well, my house-mates and I are having a house-warming party. Would you like to come? [Person2]:  sure. Would it be alright if I brought a few friends? [Person1]:  the more, the merrier! [Person2]:  will there be a lot of people there? [Person1]:  I sure hope so. We've each invited about 10 people. [Person2]:  who else is going to be there? [Person1]:  I'm inviting my friends from work, you, my sister, and a few friends from school. [Person2]:  I know your sister. She's very nice. [Person1]:  don't worry. You won't be sitting there by yourself. [Person2]:  what time is it going to start? [Person1]:  most people are working Friday night, so it's going to start around 9 pm. [Person2]:  should I bring anything? [Person1]:  we'll have beer and snacks, but if you want to bring a bottle of wine, that'd be great. [Person2]:  I could also bring some music if you want. I've got loads of songs on my new iPod. [Person1]:  that'd be great. I'll see you then!
[Person1]:  Can I help you? [Person2]:  Have you got the latest ONXIU magazine? [Person1]:  Yes, but it's checked out. [Person2]:  What a pity! I missed it again. [Person1]:  It's popular you know. You want to reserve it? [Person2]:  Yes, please. [Person1]:  Fill out this form and we will send you a note when we get the book. [Person2]:  Thank you. What shall I do when I check out these books? [Person1]:  Take the card, and fill in your name and library card number. [Person2]:  Thank you so much.
[Person1]:  Julia, are you free tonight? [Person2]:  What's up? [Person1]:  I want to invite you to go to the movies. [Person2]:  Are you asking me for a date? [Person1]:  Yes. [Person2]:  I don't like to go to the movies on a date. It's noisy there. [Person1]:  Where do you want to meet? [Person2]:  Let's go to the coffee shop then. It's quiet there. [Person1]:  What time should we meet? [Person2]:  How about seven? [Person1]:  All right.
[Person1]:  Okay, I'll take it. By the way, do you have delivery service? [Person2]:  You don't need to carry the furniture home because we have delivery service. [Person1]:  Do you charge for delivery? [Person2]:  Wo will deliver the goods to you for free. [Person1]:  Very good. Could you deliver it to this address? [Person2]:  Sure. Please write down your name and your phone number. [Person1]:  OK. Can you tell me the delivery time? [Person2]:  No later than tomorrow. [Person1]:  Thanks.
[Person1]:  May, look, what's that in the cage? [Person2]:  Don't you know that? It's panda. [Person1]:  Of course I know. I just can't see it very well. [Person2]:  OK, then put on your glasses, and do you know what does the panda eat? [Person1]:  Of course, Bamboo! [Person2]:  That's right. [Person1]:  I also know they are given to other countries as gifts for friendship. [Person2]:  You sound quite knowledgeable. [Person1]:  Not really, panda is my favorite animal. [Person2]:  Actually, it likes milk too. [Person1]:  Any way, in a word, panda is our friend. [Person2]:  Do you know other famous animals in the world? [Person1]:  Yeah, let me think, the kangaroo and koala bear from Australia are very famous. [Person2]:  That's right. OK, let's move on.
[Person1]:  How long have you been teaching in this middle school? [Person2]:  For ten years. To be frank, I'm tired of teaching the same textbook for so long though I do enjoy being a teacher. I'm considering trying something new.
[Person1]:  Your boarding pass, please! [Person2]:  Here it is. [Person1]:  Thanks. [Person2]:  Where is my seat? [Person1]:  15A. Just over there, sir. [Person2]:  Thank you, Miss. By the way, where can I put my bag'? [Person1]:  You can put your coat and small things on the shelf over your feet. [Person2]:  I've got two bags. I'll afraid I can't put them down there. Can I put them on the shelf above? [Person1]:  All right, sir. [Person2]:  And where is the washroom? [Person1]:  Behind the curtain. [Person2]:  Thank you again. [Person1]:  You're welcome.
[Person1]:  Hey, Peter, I'm sorry! [Person2]:  Hi, Diana, what's wrong? [Person1]:  We were going to Hong Kong this weekend, but I'm afraid I can't go. [Person2]:  How come? [Person1]:  I have a really big geography test and I have to study for it. [Person2]:  We can go next week instead. [Person1]:  No, I don't want to ruin your weekend. You go ahead and please take the book I bought to my friend Sally. Tell her I have to study all weekend, because I can't afford to fail the test. [Person2]:  Ok, then I'll go with Dan. But it's a pity you can't come.
[Person1]:  Good morning, sir. [Person2]:  Good morning. I'd like to buy two tickets to New York, please. [Person1]:  When do you want to leave, sir? [Person2]:  Next Saturday.

[Person1]:  Alison, would you like to have some more?  [Person2]:  No thanks. I have had enough.  [Person1]:  Actually you haven't have much.  [Person2]:  To tell you the truth, I am on the diet.  [Person1]:  That sounds ridiculous. Why?  [Person2]:  Well, I am gaining weight these days, and I have to watch my calories. 
[Person1]:  The boys in this picture look awesome, Susan. Who are they? [Person2]:  There are members of a band called R5. Their music is really popular right now online. I'm a big fan. This boy here is Ross and these here are Rocky, Riker and Rydel Lynch. Oh, and this is Ellington Ratliff. [Person1]:  So who is this boy in the middle again? [Person2]:  That's Ross. He's the lead singer and plays the rhythm guitar. [Person1]:  What do the others do in the band? [Person2]:  Rocky is a guitarist. Rydell plays keyboard and Ratliff plays the drums. [Person1]:  Do you have one of their albums? [Person2]:  Yes, I just bought their main album last month. Do you want to borrow it? You can take it home and listen to it. [Person1]:  Yes, I'd love to.
[Person1]:  I'd like some information about opening a savings account. [Person2]:  A savings account? Certainly, what would you like to know? [Person1]:  Could you tell me what the interest rate is? [Person2]:  It's five and a quarter percent. [Person1]:  I see. [Person2]:  Would you like to open the savings account with us? [Person1]:  Yes, I would. [Person2]:  All right. I'll get a form for you to fill out.
[Person1]:  Hello. [Person2]:  Hi, my name is Kelsey Adams. I'm calling about the TV. [Person1]:  Oh, hi. So you saw my ad in the newspaper? [Person2]:  That's right. My old TV just stopped working, so I think this might be great for both of us. [Person1]:  I hope so. It's a 50 inch Sony flat screen TV and it's only 6 months old. I'm asking for $500. But I'd be willing to negotiate. [Person2]:  It sounds like a decent deal, but I would have to see at first of course. [Person1]:  Absolutely. When can you come over to take a look at it? [Person2]:  How about 3 [Person1]:  Hmm... I've got a meeting at 2 [Person2]:  Perfect, just tell me your address.
[Person1]:  How was your interview? [Person2]:  Pretty good, the manager asked me the usual questions, then he asked me why I decided to leave my previous job. [Person1]:  What did you say? [Person2]:  I told him that I hadn't gotten a raise for 3 years. I also told him that one of my coworkers quit her job because she had not been promoted for 8 years. [Person1]:  Did he want to know the reasons? [Person2]:  Yes, I told him that my boss made some excuses about the economy. I thought he had a pattern of only promoting men, though. [Person1]:  That's sex discrimination. So when will you hear back about that job? [Person2]:  In a couple of days.
[Person1]:  You look fresh recently. And.. what's your weight now? [Person2]:  110 pounds. [Person1]:  Really? Congratulations! That's really something beyond my imagination. How did you make it? Did you keep on a diet? [Person2]:  No, you know I can't bear eating less. [Person1]:  Then do the slim pills take effect on you? [Person2]:  I've quit it already. I go to aerobics class everyday instead. [Person1]:  How's it going on? [Person2]:  You see. I've lost my weight in spite of my good appetite. [Person1]:  I'd better exercise my body too. My limbs are rusty now. [Person2]:  I don't think so. You look full of energy every day. Time has stood still with you. [Person1]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  Hello? [Person2]:  Hi, Deborah! This is John. I'm calling from Australia. [Person1]:  What are you doing in Australia? [Person2]:  I'm attending a conference in Sydney this week.

[Person1]:  I went to visit a customer in IVS Company the other day. Their offices were very impressive, especially their company Logo which is all over the place. There are Logo models in metal, copper, clove, paper. They are even printed on the wall paper and the balls of the table-lights. It is really decorated identity. [Person2]:  It is just too much. Don't you feel it is an exaggerating style to decorate offices in that way? [Person1]:  Not at all! I like the design so much. The designer must have thought really hard to come out with such a brilliant concept. [Person2]:  Wow, I doubt that.
[Person1]:  Hey, This is your order. [Person2]:  Are you new here? I come to this coffeehouse often. But I didn't see you here before. [Person1]:  Yes. I started this part-time job just three days ago. And my internship will last 1 week. I'm still a student now. [Person2]:  Do you mind if I ask you why you've taken the part-time job here?

Or you just study English for interest's sake? [Person1]:  No, I'm not an English student. But I do like English. I'm going to be a volunteer in the 2008 Olympics where I want to be helpful with the language. So I try to improve my English. [Person2]:  Very nice. Thank you for your time. [Person1]:  Thank you, sir. But I'm not allowed to accept any tips. [Person2]:  OK then. I don't want to put you in trouble. [Person1]:  Well, would you like something else? The new-made cafe parfait is really good. Want some? [Person2]:  OK. But I'd like some cookies. [Person1]:  Sure. If you want more coffee, please go over there. There is self-help coffee maker. [Person2]:  I surely know that. Don't forget that I am a regular customer here. [Person1]:  Oops. Well, wait for a while. We'll get it done quickly. [Person2]:  It's OK. Thank you.
[Person1]:  How do I set up an email account? [Person2]:  Oh, that's easy. Go to yahoo. com. Now, click on the link with the picture of an envelope. [Person1]:  Which link? [Person2]:  That one, the one that says, ' Mail. ' [Person1]:  Oh, no. What did I do? It's asking me for a password. [Person2]:  Don't worry. See where it says, ' New User '? [Person1]:  Yes. [Person2]:  Click on that. [Person1]:  Oh, I see. [Person2]:  Yeah, just fill out this form and choose a password. The computer will do the rest.
[Person1]:  Will I get notification that I qualify for unemployment? [Person2]:  The Employment Development Office will send you a Notice of Unemployment Insurance Award letter. [Person1]:  What is contained in that letter? [Person2]:  In addition to telling you how much you will receive, the beginning and ending dates of your claim will be included. [Person1]:  Will the Award Letter tell me what I need to fill out next? [Person2]:  You will receive a Continued Claim Form and every two weeks, you must turn it in. [Person1]:  When I fill out the Continued Claim Form, what will I need to tell them? [Person2]:  You must show where and when you tried to look for work. If you earned any money, you need to tell them about it. [Person1]:  What other information does the form ask for? [Person2]:  You have to tell them if you were too sick to work on any of the days that you should have been looking for work.
[Person1]:  Ten dollars? Maybe there are a lot of them. . . [Person2]:  Seven dollars!!! Incredible! But I saw that the seller has kind of a bad rating. [Person1]:  Was it a delivery problem or a problem with the products? [Person2]:  I read that someone called him a cheat and a liar! And I noticed that he won't ship abroad. [Person1]:  Some people get nasty on those comments. Maybe you should write him and ask nicely. [Person2]:  OK. Wish me luck!
[Person1]:  Hi I came in on flight 513. Everyone else took their luggage off the conveyor belt, but mine didn't seem to be there. [Person2]:  Let me check the computer. Uh-oh, Looks like your luggage is on its way to Paris. [Person1]:  You're kidding. What am I going to do? [Person2]:  Well, we can give you this lovely shaving kit and call you the minute your luggage arrives here. Just leave us a contact number. [Person1]:  You can reach me at 13661306917. [Person2]:  Thank you. I am terribly sorry about this. It very rarely happens. We do have a sophisticated tracking system, so I know we will find it soon. But we apologize for the inconvenience. [Person1]:  That's ok. There wasn't anything important in there anyway. The shaving kit more than makes up for my lost luggage. [Person2]:  Wow! I have been working here for 15 years and you're the first person to accept a lost luggage situation cheerfully. [Person1]:  I'Ve had a lot worse problems than this traveling so it's really no big deal.
[Person1]:  I lost track of time, am I late? [Person2]:  Yes. What kept you from arriving on time? [Person1]:  My friend needed me to help him. [Person2]:  I realize that everyone has emergencies ; just get here on time from now on. [Person1]:  I will try. My apologies. [Person2]:  I appreciate you saying that and would like you to join us in our meeting. [Person1]:  Sure, I'll sit right here. [Person2]:  Wonderful, does anyone have any questions about this project? [Person1]:  I am confused about the projected revenues. [Person2]:  I'm glad that some of you get it, but let's go over it once more.
[Person1]:  Can you tell me the best way to look for an apartment? [Person2]:  The local newspaper has ads for housing. [Person1]:  Is there any way to find a roommate to share an apartment with? [Person2]:  Sometimes you can post an advertisement saying that you need a roommate. [Person1]:  What do landlords charge for rent? [Person2]:  Would you like an apartment for just yourself, or do you need it for two people? [Person1]:  There are two of us, but we only need a one-bedroom apartment.

I think I am. Shall we have the lunch at the Mass restaurant [Person2]:  Good idea. What time shall we meet? [Person1]:  Is 1 o'clock ok with you? [Person2]:  Great. See you then.
[Person1]:  This TV set is getting worse and worse. Now it doesn't work at all. [Person2]:  Here's an advertisement on the newspaper about a big TV sale. Usually a big sale like this would have some good bargains. What would you say?
[Person1]:  Honey, do you know what color the carrot is?  [Person2]:  Mom, it's orange?  [Person1]:  Wow, my son is so clever.  [Person2]:  Mom, that's a stupid question.  [Person1]:  Really?  [Person2]:  I am not a child at all. I know more.  [Person1]:  Oh, my son looks like a grown-up.  [Person2]:  Sure. Mom, I can take care of you.  [Person1]:  No kidding.

[Person1]:  I see you've brought something to occupy your time while we wait. Good. We may be here a long time.  [Person2]:  Yes, Papa. I brought the catalog for the next college we're going to visit--the one in New Hampshire.  [Person1]:  It's just that North Americans pay more attention to exact times. They're very punctual people.  [Person2]:  I think that if you're more than thirty minutes late, you have to apologize and explain what delayed you.  [Person1]:  Our appointment with this dean is for three-fifteen. My watch says three-thirty. I'm sure we're not late. [Person3]:  Isabel? Come in. Sorry I kept you waiting. We're running a little behind schedule today. 
[Person1]:  So do you believe in palmistry?  [Person2]:  Palmistry? What is that?  [Person1]:  It's when someone takes a look at another person's palm4 to tell the future.  [Person2]:  Oh, you mean palm reading5. I've seen that before, but I don't believe in it.  [Person1]:  Are you sure? I've read a lot about palmistry and I've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm. Do you want me to take a look at your hand?  [Person2]:  Really? You've read books about it? Ok, then. But only if you want to.  [Person1]:  Ok, let's see, well, you've got a long life line, which is good, and the love line is strong ... ...  [Person2]:  What else do you see? Will I be successful? Will I make a lot of money?  [Person1]:  Hmm, hard to say, wait, yes, it looks like you will do well in business, and your ambition will help you a lot, but ... ...  [Person2]:  What? What is it? What's the matter?  [Person1]:  You seem to have a large gullibility line. You believe everything that you're told.  [Person2]:  Hey! 
[Person1]:  Mr. Lin, what are you interested in?  [Person2]:  I enjoy camping.  [Person1]:  Really? I'm not much of an outdoor person. What do you like about it?  [Person2]:  I love the fresh air, the scenery the exercise, and the time to think.  [Person1]:  Do you hike or fish on your trips?  [Person2]:  Yes, both.

[Person2]:  Great! I can't wait. 
[Person1]:  Please open your books to page 10. (To Mary) Can I help you?  [Person2]:  I'm sorry that I'm late. I couldn't find the room.  [Person1]:  That's alright. It's the first day of school, after all.  [Person2]:  What are we doing?  [Person1]:  I'm asking the class to read page 10 to themselves. Then I'm going to ask some questions about the passage.  [Person2]:  May I have a book?  [Person1]:  Here. Write your name inside the front cover. Remember that you must return the textbook to me at the end of the semester, so keep it in good condition.

[Person1]:  Now Mr.Snow, what can you remember about the attack? [Person2]:  Well, I was working late yesterday evening. [Person1]:  What time did you leave your office? [Person2]:  About 9 [Person1]:  Are you sure? [Person2]:  Yes, officer. I looked at my watch. [Person1]:  What did you do then? [Person2]:  Well, I locked the door and I was walking to my car when somebody hit me on the head. [Person1]:  Did you see the attacker? [Person2]:  No, he was wearing a stocking over his head.

[Person1]:  Hi. I ' m here for flight 514 returning to Beijing but the board shows there is a delay.How long of a delay is expected? [Person2]:  So far it looks like we will be leaving two hours late, but keep checking the departing flights status board just in case. [Person1]:  Do you think it ' s safe to leave to get a quick bite? [Person2]:  I think you should stay in the airport. Even though the delay is expected to be two hours, the flight departure could be announced any minute. Who knows? [Person1]:  What seems to be the problem? [Person2]:  It seems there are some loose bolts on one of the wings. It happens all the time. No need to worry. [Person1]:  Umm... You know... Actually I was thinking of trying another airline. No need to hold my seat.
[Person1]:  How did you first meet? [Person2]:  My roommate invited both of us to dinner. [Person1]:  Was it love at first sight? Did you fall in love with her the first time you met her? [Person2]:  Yes! The first time I saw her I knew we would fall in love.
[Person1]:  In my opinions, someone else has caused the fire of this house. [Person2]:  Who do you think that has the motive? [Person1]:  I'm not sure now. In any case, let's first make some careful investigations. [Person2]:  OK, murder will out! [Person1]:  Yeah.
[Person1]:  Are you ok, Chuck? You look pale. [Person2]:  I'm fine, Katherine. I just stayed up late last night working on my Chinese. [Person1]:  Oh, poor you. You know what? I found a new way to learn Chinese and it works very well. [Person2]:  You did? Do tell me. I've spent all these months trying to learn something new about it, but I've made little progress! [Person1]:  Sure. I'm learning Chinese through songs. [Person2]:  So you're learning Chinese songs? [Person1]:  You can say that. I can actually sing some of them now. [Person2]:  That's a real achievement. How did you do that? [Person1]:  I start by listening to the song a few times and after several times I am able to follow the singer. [Person2]:  It makes sense. [Person1]:  It does. I've learned some Chinese folk songs this way. They are clearly presented and easy to follow. [Person2]:  Can Join you, Katherine? I do want to have a try. [Person1]:  Why not? I downloaded a beautiful song the other day. We can learn it together now. [Person2]:  Great. Do you think we need a Chinese dictionary? [Person1]:  Yes, just in case we run into me new characters. [Person2]:  Ok. I will bring it with me.
[Person1]:  What else can I do for you today? [Person2]:  Well, I've been browsing online, but I'm not really sure what to do about payment.

[Person1]:  Can you tell me the results of my home inspection? [Person2]:  Before I answer that, I want to make sure that you know what I was looking for. Are you clear on what I was looking for? [Person1]:  I never had a home inspection before. [Person2]:  I inspect the home for problems that might not be all that apparent in a quick walk-through. [Person1]:  I asked the owners, and they said that everything was great with the house. [Person2]:  The owners might not be aware of everything wrong with the house. Some things are hidden, but might still be a problem for you in the future. [Person1]:  I heard that the owners must fix all of the problems before the escrow closes. [Person2]:  I inform you of the problems. If there are major problems, you can decline to buy the house or they may wish to fix any problems. [Person1]:  What kinds of things did you discover in my home inspection? [Person2]:  I found some fairly major problems. A major support beam in the roof is broken, and the shower floor leaked and rotted out the second-floor joist.
[Person1]:  Professor, where's Canada? [Person2]:  Canada is north of here. [Person1]:  Can you show me on the map? [Person2]:  Sure. Look here. Canada is north of the United States. [Person1]:  Oh, I see. Where's Mexico? [Person2]:  Mexico is south of the United States. [Person1]:  How about Connecticut? Where's that? [Person2]:  Connecticut is east of New York.

[Person1]:  I'Ve been under stress, but no more than usual. [Person2]:  Have you been getting enough sleep lately? [Person1]:  No, I only sleep a few hours a night. [Person2]:  Have you had any head injuries lately? [Person1]:  Yes, actually I fell skiing last week and hit my head. [Person2]:  I am going to send you for a CT scan, and I will see you again when we see the results.
[Person1]:  I need help. I think my arm is broken. [Person2]:  Alright. Have you been to this hospital before? [Person1]:  No, I haven't. I need help quick. It hurts really badly. [Person2]:  I understand. It's good you came to the emergency room. [Person1]:  Let me see a doctor. [Person2]:  I'm sorry, sir. You will need to wait at least a short time. We are very busy tonight. There was a big car accident on Highway 106. [Person1]:  I thought this was the emergency room. [Person2]:  It is. But unless you are critically injured, you still need to wait. You aren't bleeding, are you? [Person1]:  No. Only a little. I fell off my porch. [Person2]:  Oh, that's terrible. Is it your right arm or your left arm? [Person1]:  My left arm. [Person2]:  Can you fill out this form then? [Person1]:  No, I can't. I'm left-handed. [Person2]:  That's very inconvenient for you then. You'll probably have a cast on your left arm. [Person1]:  Yes. But why do I have to fill out a form anyway? This is the emergency room. [Person2]:  Yes, it is. But even in emergency rooms there is some paperwork to be done. Have you ever been in an emergency room before?
[Person1]:  May I help you? [Person2]:  Yes. I'm sorry, but I've lost my passbook. [Person1]:  Well. Can you tell me how much you have deposited? [Person2]:  About RMB 12, 000. [Person1]:  Please let me have your name and your savings account number if you remember it. [Person2]:  I'm Bob Brown. But I can't recall my account number. [Person1]:  Don't worry, Mr. Brown. Let me try to check it for you. One moment, please. Yes, I have your account number here. The balance is exactly RMB 12, 000 [Person2]:  Thank goodness. It is still there. Thank you very much. [Person1]:  It's my pleasure. Please fill out this lost passbook bill and list the code word you used when you first opened your account. [Person2]:  OK.
[Person1]:  Is everything ready for the Christmas party? [Person2]:  Almost. I'Ve put up the decorations, and we'Ve decorated the Christmas tree with plenty of tinsel and baubles. [Person1]:  I like the big star on the top of the tree. I'll put the presents under the tree later, how's the food. [Person2]:  I'Ve prepared most of it already and we'Ve got plenty of snack foods-you know, crisps, biscuits, and things. Are you going to make the punch? [Person1]:  Yes. I'Ve bought all the things to go in it. It won't take long to make. How many people are coming to the party? [Person2]:  I think everyone will be coming. Dave don't come because he has to go to his parent's home and they live in Scotland. [Person1]:  Do we have Christmas pudding? [Person2]:  Yes, we do. I hope we have enough for everyone. Did you send out all your Christmas cards in time? [Person1]:  Yes, I did. I send most of them a week ago. I'Ve brought some with me to the party to give to people in person. [Person2]:  I did the same. I spent hours yesterday evening wrapping presents. I hope I didn't forget to buy anyone something! [Person1]:  I hope you didn't forget mine!

[Person1]:  What happened? [Person2]:  Well, my husband left for work at 7 [Person1]:  Where were you? [Person2]:  I was still in bed. I heard something in the living room, so I went downstairs. And there was this man, putting money into his briefcase. I guess I surprised him. He ran out of the front door and I ran after him. [Person1]:  It's good he didn't have a gun. [Person2]:  You said it. Well, he fell down the steps and broke his leg. That's when I called you. [Person1]:  We've been looking for this man. In the past two weeks, he has broken into 20 homes in this area.
[Person1]:  Well, I can't believe your uncle and aunt came to stay with us for a week, and they did not even call us in advance.  [Person2]:  John, they are old-fashioned people from the Chinese countryside. That's their custom.  [Person1]:  I know, but it is hard for me to get used to your relatives coming to visit us, and without warning.  [Person2]:  Don't your relatives visit other relatives?  [Person1]:  Yes, but Americans never visit without calling in advance, and they almost never stay overnight.  [Person2]:  I think that maybe Chinese families are closer than your families.  [Person1]:  I think you're right! 
[Person1]:  A friend of mine is now in the big house. He was caught red-handed for selling cocaine.  [Person2]:  That is a deadly risky business. He should have it coming on him.  [Person1]:  He must be regretting about having done the business.  [Person2]:  I bet he is. He domed his own life. 
[Person1]:  Excuse me mam, can you tell me how to get to Son College? I'm walking. [Person2]:  Well, I think the simplest way for you is to go up to Main Street over there, turn left on Main Street and keep going for about 20 minutes, when you get to water square turn right keep on past the mass hospital to the end of the road and then take a left turn you'll be on rain avenue. Walk 2 blocks until you see the farmers bank, cross the street and almost immediately take a left turn again. The entrance to Son colleges is down 50 meters on your right. Can you remember all that? [Person1]:  I guess I got a little lost in the middle. We are at Park Road now, aren't we? [Person2]:  Yes, turn left at the lights you will be on Main Street. Well, perhaps the best thing for you is to find your way to the mass hospital and ask again. [Person1]:  OK thanks a lot. [Person2]:  My pleasure.
[Person1]:  What were you thinking? You nearly hit me. [Person2]:  What are you talking about? You saw my signal and when I turned left, you sped up and blocked me. [Person1]:  I was just driving through a yellow light, so I couldn't stop. [Person2]:  You are lucky there were no police around. Or you would have gotten a ticket for sure. Hits drivers like you that give the rest of us a bad name.
[Person1]:  I would like to speak to you, if you don ' t mind. [Person2]:  What would you like to speak to me about? [Person1]:  I would like to talk to you about this year ' s election. [Person2]:  Is that right? [Person1]:  I am a volunteer for this year ' s campaign. [Person2]:  That ' s wonderful. I am impressed at someone so young taking a stand. [Person1]:  I know history is about to be made, and I would like to be a part of it. [Person2]:  That ' s fantastic. [Person1]:  Are you planning on voting? [Person2]:  I ' m going to vote. [Person1]:  Go to your polling place early on Election Day. [Person2]:  I will. Good luck with your volunteering.
[Person1]:  Janice, I can't find the document I was working on last month. Can you help me to look for it? [Person2]:  Susan, I'm sorry. Did you look up those files I requested? [Person1]:  Yes, but I still can not find it. Maybe it is in this cabinet. [Person2]:  I couldn't find the files you request, even though I checked all the cross-references. I don't think it's there. [Person1]:  I am sure that document was filed. [Person2]:  Well, let me check again under a different heading. [Person1]:  Good idea! It seems that I asked you to put it in Nova's files. [Person2]:  Maybe that's why I couldn't find it. All the documents on Nova are filed under ' V '.
[Person1]:  Room service. What can I do for you? [Person2]:  This is room 2012. Where is my laundry? You promised to send to me this morning. [Person1]:  Well, let me check for you. I am sorry, sir. They mistook your order as a normal one. Actualty it's an express laundry, is that right? [Person2]:  Yes, I ordered the express service. [Person1]:  Sir, we are terribly sorry for that. We will refund the charge and send your laundry to your room 3 hours later. Is that all right? [Person2]:  That's fine.
[Person1]:  Hey, there's Leo. I wonder why he's walking arm in arm with that young woman. [Person2]:  It's as plain as the nose on your face. They're dating each other. [Person1]:  You're pulling my leg! She must be thirty years younger than Leo. Talk about robbing the cradle! [Person2]:  Well, you can bet this relationship's going to be a flash in the pan. [Person1]:  It must have been love at first sight because I know he didn't have a girlfriend last week. [Person2]:  I think you are absolutely right. Actually, my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks. They got married a month later.
[Person1]:  Happy birthday, Aims! [Person2]:  Thank you, Lisa. [Person1]:  Here is a present for you. I hope you like it. [Person2]:  Oh, great! I love it! You know I've been expecting this for a long time. [Person1]:  I'm very glad to hear that. [Person2]:  Come here ; let me introduce some friends to you.
[Person1]:  You are married to a foreigner, aren't you? So what's it like? [Person2]:  Well, in the first year of our marriage, we had great difficulties in getting along. The things that are important to me are not important to him. We had a lot of conflicts. [Person1]:  Yeah, I know what you mean. The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples, not to mention two people from different cultures. [Person2]:  Now we have a two-year-old boy. We're very happy that he's healthy and smart. [Person1]:  Oh, so he's half Chinese and half American. That's unusual. What languages does he speak, then? [Person2]:  Right now he speaks mostly English, and he can say a few Chinese words. But he will learn in the future. [Person1]:  What does he look like? Can people tell? [Person2]:  Yes, people surely can. He's whiter than the Chinese kids, and his hair is a little blonde. My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though.
[Person1]:  Mark. Where have you been? I'Ve been calling you all morning. [Person2]:  I'Ve been playing computer games. [Person1]:  What? So you blew me off yesterday and today over a stupid video game? What game is so important that you have no time for me anymore? What are you playing? [Person2]:  It's called Counter Strike. It's a first person shooter game. It's awesome. It's a multi player game where you can go online and compete against players from all over the world. [Person1]:  You'Ve been wasting your time on this? I can't believe it! It doesn't even look fun or challenging! [Person2]:  My laptop is on my bed. If you think it's so easy then get on line and try to beat me. [Person1]:  Fine! [Person2]:  Damp it! How are you killing me with a single shot? It's not fair! I don't want to play anymore! Let's go get something to eat. [Person1]:  Can you bring me something? I am totally hooked on this game!
[Person1]:  I'Ve always wondered, what's the difference between English for Chinese students and English for native students? [Person2]:  I don't know. What do you think? [Person1]:  I think a Chinese student concentrates on written English, and uses it as a basis for communicating. From start to finish he's learning vocabulary and fundamentals of grammar. This is a very difficult way to learn. [Person2]:  What do natives get? [Person1]:  They get higher level English, which is more formal than everyday spoken English. They also deal with matters of style and creativity. [Person2]:  Do you mean that a native doesn't make any mistakes in grammar? [Person1]:  Absolutely not! Native speakers make a lot of grammar mistakes, especially if they come from a home where nonstandard English is spoken. [Person2]:  I suppose that only a small percentage of college students don't know standard English in American universities. [Person1]:  Actually there are more non-native speakers than you think. That's why it's so important to quit worrying about making mistakes. Just talk to everyone every chance you get.
[Person1]:  We have a holiday next week, don't we? [Person2]:  Yes, on Monday. [Person1]:  What're you going to do? [Person2]:  I'm probably going to spend the day looking at cars. [Person1]:  At cars! You aren't thinking about buying a car, are you? [Person2]:  Yes, I am. I'd like to be able to get around a little more. [Person1]:  But it will be expensive to have a car in the city, won't it? [Person2]:  Oh, I don't know. Of course, gasoline costs a lot these days. [Person1]:  But what about parking? You can't park on the street, can you? [Person2]:  A lot of people do. I'll try it for a while anyway, but I certainly don't want to pay a lot of parking tickets.
[Person1]:  What games do you like? [Person2]:  I like word games. [Person1]:  How about a game of bridge? [Person2]:  I don't like it at all. [Person1]:  What about guessing games? [Person2]:  I'm not one for the games. [Person1]:  Let's play other game. [Person2]:  What about playing go? [Person1]:  OK.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, is this the parcel post counter? [Person2]:  No, it's at counter 1, right over there. [Person1]:  ( At counter 1. ) Do you take parcels here? [Person2]:  Yes. [Person1]:  I want to send this package to Los Angeles, please. [Person2]:  Do you want to send it by air or by regular mail? [Person1]:  I'd like to send it by regular mail. [Person2]:  I'll have to weigh it first. 120 yuan, please. [Person1]:  Here is 200. [Person2]:  Your change, please. [Person1]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  Can you direct me to some fresh produce that's on sale? [Person2]:  Well, we've got some great mangoes on sale. [Person1]:  Mangoes? What are mangoes? [Person2]:  Well, it's a fruit with a big seed in it. [Person1]:  Can you eat the seed? [Person2]:  No. Peel the skin with a sharp knife, and throw out the seed. [Person1]:  Well, how much are they? [Person2]:  Well, they're on sale today for only $ 1 each. [Person1]:  Can you describe their taste? [Person2]:  They usually taste sweet, but they remind me of an orange. [Person1]:  How can I tell if they're ripe? [Person2]:  You can buy them either ripe or unripe. Unripe ones are hard. [Person1]:  Where do they grow mangoes? [Person2]:  The ones that are on sale are from Central America.
[Person1]:  May I come in? [Person2]:  Come in, please. [Person1]:  I'm sorry to trouble you, but I'd like to ask when I will get a raise. [Person2]:  In 3 months or so. [Person1]:  You said the same thing three months ago. [Person2]:  Did I? Well, anyway, you will get your raise when the economy starts picking up. [Person1]:  You mean that I won't get a raise until the recession ends? [Person2]:  Yes. [Person1]:  I got the message. I'm quiting. [Person2]:  Nah, don't be so fast. We like your work here, but this company is on hard times and I can't be handing out raises for anyone. [Person1]:  I've been here for 3 years, and I haven't had a raise in all that time. If you like my work, it should be reflected in my pay, and I feel it isn't. [Person2]:  I hear what you're saying, and I wish there were something I could do. [Person1]:  Very well, consider me gone.

[Person2]:  ok. i've got a list of place that fit your requirements. let's just go through them. the first on the list costs 80 pounds a month, but it's on a noisy street and it's a little far from t [Person1]:  how far away is it from the campus? [Person2]:  it's about two miles away. that might be a little far to walk. here's one that's about half a mile from the campus. the cost is 100 pounds a month and it's on a small street, just off a [Person1]:  that sounds ideal. can we go to have a look at it? we'd like to see it before making a final decision. [Person2]:  of course. i'm not very busy at the moment. if you can wait for about 15 or 20 minutes. i can take you there. [Person1]:  thank you. that would be great.
[Person1]:  Good afternoon, madam. I'm doing some market research and I'm hoping you might have a few minutes to answer some questions. [Person2]:  Okay, sure. [Person1]:  Great, thank you very much. First of all, do you own a personal computer? [Person2]:  Of course! Doesn't everyone? [Person1]:  How long have you owned it? [Person2]:  I bought this particular computer last year. But I got my first PC in 1995. [Person1]:  I see. And what do you primarily use your computer for? [Person2]:  Well, I use it to send e-mails a lot, and... um, I have a teach-yourself French program. And I shop online pretty often. [Person1]:  Mmm. Any other uses? [Person2]:  Keeping track of my bank account, and there are a couple of computer games I enjoy. [Person1]:  Now you've mentioned e-mail and online shopping. Do you use the Internet for any other purposes? [Person2]:  Not really. I haven't got around to explore it too much. [Person1]:  Okay, thanks. Sorry to have given you so much trouble. Thanks again.
[Person1]:  Now let's begin the class. Who is on duty today?  [Person2]:  I am, sir.  [Person1]:  Please come to the front to have five minutes' free talk in English. Very well! Whose turn is it to have a free talk?  [Person2]:  It's me, sir. But I am sorry I have forgotten to prepare for it.  [Person1]:  Well. Don't forget to perform your duty next time, ok? Now, let's start our lesson. 
[Person1]:  Excuse me. Do you have this in blue?  [Person2]:  Yes, we do. That one comes in green blue and red.  [Person1]:  And sorry. I can't find the price. How much is it?  [Person2]:  Oh, that's 39 dollars and 95 cents. It's on the sale at the moment.  [Person1]:  OK. Do you have it in extra small?  [Person2]:  I'll just go and check for you. 
[Person1]:  Bob, why don't we go out to lunch today and visit some friends? [Person2]:  I'll miss today's football game. I can't miss it. [Person1]:  Honestly, Bob, don't you ever get tired of football games? [Person2]:  This will be one of the best games of the year. Why don't you watch it with me? You might like it. [Person1]:  I have better things to do with my Sunday afternoons. Besides it's too rough for me.
[Person1]:  Well, hello, please come in and sit down. Your name is Mary North, I see. [Person2]:  Yes. [Person1]:  So why don't you tell me about yourself? [Person2]:  Uh well, certainly, I come from Japan, but now I live here in London. I received a degree in business English at the university of Chicago in America, and I organized many activities at university. These are all in my application. [Person1]:  Well, how about your office skills? Can you type fast? [Person2]:  I can type. But not very fast. [Person1]:  Can you do word processing and financial reports? [Person2]:  Now I can't. But I'd like to learn about computers. [Person1]:  What about languages? [Person2]:  Well, I speak Japanese. My French is good, and I can speak English very well. [Person1]:  Oh yes, I think will send you a letter next week.
[Person1]:  Hi Linda, I hear there's going to be a table tennis match in the Sports Center this evening. [Person2]:  Really? [Person1]:  Yes, it's true. The Chinese team will play the national team from Singapore. [Person2]:  That's great. Is it a match between the Mens team or the women's team? [Person1]:  Both teams are made up of excellent players, it short to be an exciting game. By the way have you got any tickets? [Person2]:  Not yet, but I hear it is difficult to get a ticket. [Person1]:  Don't worry. I'll try my best to get one for you this afternoon. [Person2]:  Thank you for your help. [Person1]:  I'll call you if I get the tickets.
[Person1]:  In Britain, we are often told that people are leaving the big cities to live in the countryside, but is this the same worldwide? [Person2]:  Not at all. If you look at the biggest cities in one thousand nine hundred and fifty, 7 out of the top 10 were in the developed countries. But by the year two thousand, the developing countries will have 8 out of top 10. New York, which in one thousand nine hundred and fifty, was number one with a population of around 12,000,000 will only be the sixth the largest city in the world, but with an extra 2 million. [Person1]:  And London? [Person2]:  London, which was number 2, won't even be in the top ten, its population in one thousand nine hundred and fifty, by the way, was about 10,000,000. [Person1]:  And why is this happening? Why are people moving to the big cities from the country in the developing countries? [Person2]:  The reasons are various, but many are moving to look for work and the problems caused by this are enormous. It said the 26,000,000 people will be living in Mexico City by the year two thousand, with Sao Paulo in Brazil, not far behind. [Person1]:  It's hard to believe. [Person2]:  I know. Well, just imagine the difficulties this is going to cause in terms of health, transport, an education.
[Person1]:  I'm really looking forward to going camping this summer, Jason. When I get into the forest, I feel like I can finally relax. It's better than any beach. [Person2]:  Me too, Sarah. I can't wait to sit by a fire and sleep in the forest under the stars. The one thing I find stressful, however, is the packing. [Person1]:  Why is that? [Person2]:  We have to bring sleeping bags, clothes, food, water, games and so much more, but we don't have enough room in our car for extra stuff. It's really frustrating. [Person1]:  That's why I want a car with far more enough space like Marie Antonis. They store all their camping things inside. [Person2]:  Yeah, sounds like we have to save up money for a new car.
[Person1]:  Hey! I just bought one of those new Japanese cell phones! It's loaded with extras. [Person2]:  What does it do? [Person1]:  It's got a built-in video camera so you can see the person you're talking to.It also takes stills and I can use the E-mail mode to send digital pictures straight to my friend's phone! [Person2]:  Wow! What else does it do? [Person1]:  I can plug it into a folding keyboard to type in message mode. l can even surf the net. [Person2]:  Cool! Anything else? [Person1]:  Yes.With the 600 - second digital memory, l can record my voice and send it using voice message mode. [Person2]:  Wow! [Person1]:  You'll love this! I can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, I ' Ve been waiting my main dish for quite a time. [Person2]:  Yes sir, just a minute, please. I ' ll check with the kitchen. Thank you for waiting. It takes another 10 to 15 minutes, I ' m afraid. [Person1]:  I have an appointment in half an hour. [Person2]:  I see. [Person1]:  Do you have anything else I can have instead? [Person2]:  Well sir, yes. How about this stew? We can serve you at once. [Person1]:  I ' ll take this stew then.
[Person1]:  Where are you going? [Person2]:  I'm going to buy a CD. [Person1]:  Why not listen to music online? [Person2]:  Then I will have to pay quite a lot to listen to music on line, isn't it? [Person1]:  You can audition music on line, and you can audition it off line after downloading it, so you needn't pay for it. [Person2]:  I have downloaded one, but it still can't be listened. [Person1]:  In order to listen to music, you must have the necessary software. [Person2]:  Can you recommend some to me? [Person1]:  Certainly. Realplayer is a good. [Person2]:  Can I download it? [Person1]:  Yes, but you need install it after downloading so that you can use it. [Person2]:  I'll try it tonight.
[Person1]:  I am calling to say thank you for the interview yesterday. [Person2]:  You are welcome. I am very impressed by your capability. [Person1]:  Is there anything I should do? [Person2]:  No, nothing. It's thoughtful of you to call me again. [Person1]:  Thank you. Please call me at any time if you have any questions. [Person2]:  OK, I will.
[Person1]:  Hey Jack. How's it going? [Person2]:  I'm falling in love. [Person1]:  What! With who? [Person2]:  That girl in my econ class. She is so hot. [Person1]:  Did you guys go on a date already? [Person2]:  No. I didn't even talk to her yet. But I think I'm in love. [Person1]:  Does she have a boyfriend? [Person2]:  I don't think so. I've been following her around campus and I haven't seen another guy. [Person1]:  Dude, you're a stalker man. Just ask her on a date. [Person2]:  I plan on running into her in the cafeteria when she's alone. I think I'll ask her then. [Person1]:  So why do you think you're in love? [Person2]:  She's the only thing I can think of all day long. [Person1]:  That's called blind love. Well, I gotta run. Tell me how it goes next week. [Person2]:  Aright. I'll talk to you later.
[Person1]:  How do you feel about wearing name logos or slogans on your clothing? [Person2]:  I've never really thought about it before. I guess it doesn't bother me. [Person1]:  Do you think advertising has an influence on the choices you make when you're shopping? [Person2]:  I guess so. I usually buy name-brand clothing, shoes, and electronic goods. How about you? [Person1]:  I actually try to avoid name-brand items. I can't stand it when big companies advertise their products all over the place! [Person2]:  I know that advertisers are experts at persuading people to spend their money, I think brilliant items are usually higher quality than ~ grounds. [Person1]:  I think is sensible to buy products that is high quality than others when you want to buy something that's going to last a long time, but I don't think it always makes sense. [Person2]:  Do you have a brand preference for anything? [Person1]:  I do for shower items like shower gel and shampoo, but I don't for higher-end items. [Person2]:  What do you think about the ' impossible is nothing ' billboard on the high street? [Person1]:  It's just a slogan for a famous company ; there's nothing really special about it. [Person2]:  I think it's a brilliant advert! It really grabs my attention! [Person1]:  To each their own!
[Person1]:  Hey Bob. Whatchy doing? [Person2]:  I'm at home painting. [Person1]:  I didn't know you paint. What type of painting is it? [Person2]:  I enjoy oil painting. I learned it in one of my extra classes in college. [Person1]:  That sounds so interesting. I wish I learned a hobby. [Person2]:  Hobbies are never too late to learn. They offer a variety of classes at the local community college. You should look into it. [Person1]:  I think I will. Thanks for the info.
[Person1]:  I'm thinking about redecorating my bedroom. I bought this magazine in order to get some ideas. What do you think of this? [Person2]:  That looks good. The room in the picture is bigger than your bedroom, so you wouldn't be able to have all that furniture in your room. [Person1]:  I'd like to have the bed and the wardrobe. [Person2]:  You would fit both of them in your bedroom. Perhaps you could also get the dressing table. I think that one would look good in your bedroom. [Person1]:  Yes, it would. It's very expensive though. [Person2]:  Everything in this magazine seems expensive. You could probably find something similar in a discount store. [Person1]:  Yes. I'm sure I could find something similar at one. I'd also like to get a new carpet for my bedroom. [Person2]:  You can get cheap carpets easily. Another idea is to buy a rug. That would cover a lot of the carpet and you wouldn't have to replace the carpet. It would save you a lot of work. [Person1]:  That's a good idea. I'm really looking forward to redoing my bedroom.
[Person1]:  Some people are always closing their handsets, so it's difficult to inform them. [Person2]:  Why not send them short messages? [Person1]:  Can short messages reach them? [Person2]:  Short messages will be kept in the short messages center. Once they open the handsets they will receive them, which is better than you can't find them. [Person1]:  Why haven't I thought of this skill? [Person2]:  I use short messages quite a lot. If it's not too complicated I will send a short message, which can save much phone charge. [Person1]:  I am informed that many people used short messages to pay a New Year call, and only on the Spring Festival it amounted to 1 billion this year, didn't it? [Person2]:  I almost can't live without messages, from which I learn about weather forecasts and stock quotations.
[Person1]:  Hello. Mr. Rodriguez? [Person2]:  Yes. Is this Paula? [Person1]:  Yes, sir. I'Ve just dropped those slides off at the Winthrop office. Do you need anything else while I'm out? [Person2]:  No, that's all right. Paula. Why don't you get something to eat, and I'll see you this afternoon.
[Person1]:  What's the special today? [Person2]:  'All-you-can-eat'dinner special. [Person1]:  I don't like to. [Person2]:  Do you care for seafood? [Person1]:  Yes, I'm very fond of seafood. [Person2]:  Which seafood do you prefer? [Person1]:  I'd like to have red cooked sea cucumber. [Person2]:  Is there anything else you would like to have? [Person1]:  Bring me an assorted cold dish, please. [Person2]:  Would you care for beverage? [Person1]:  No, thanks. I'm fine. [Person2]:  What would you like to drink? [Person1]:  A bottle of champagne.
[Person1]:  What's the matter, sir? You look pale. [Person2]:  I feel dizzy and weak. And I'm having this pain in my ear. I think I am sick. [Person1]:  Are you often traveling by plane? [Person2]:  No, this is the second time. [Person1]:  That's right. It's normal if you don't often take the plane. Just relax a little bit. [Person2]:  Why this happens to me when I am on the plane? I feel bad. [Person1]:  Don't worry, sir. It's just because of the lower pressure. [Person2]:  What should I do about it? [Person1]:  You may feel much better if you chew some gum or peanuts. [Person2]:  OK, thanks. Does it work really? I'll give a try. [Person1]:  Are you feeling better now? Do you need some pills? [Person2]:  Much better. Thank you. I just feel tired but I can't fall asleep. [Person1]:  So, you'd better wear this eyeshade and you will sleep well. [Person2]:  I am not used to wearing that. Thanks. [Person1]:  If you try to adapt yourself to your destination's local time, you'll feel more comfortable. So please try to sleep, and have meals according to Los Angeles's time. [Person2]:  Thank you so much. [Person1]:  You are welcome. Please press the button when you need any help.
[Person1]:  I'd like to go to movies with you, Tim. But it'll be quite late after the movie. How are we coming back? The last bus back is at 9 [Person2]:  Don't worry. Auntie Lee is giving us a lift home after her class.
[Person1]:  Give me your hand. (takes Rose's hand) Close your eyes. Go on. (Rose closes her eyes) Step up. Now hold on to the rail. Keep your eyes closed; don't peek.  [Person2]:  I'm not.  [Person1]:  Step up onto the rail. Hold on. Keep your eyes closed. Trust me?  [Person2]:  I trust you.  [Person1]:  All right, open your eyes. (Rose opens her eyes. She stretches her arms, and Jack stands behind her, arms around her. )  [Person2]:  I'm fling, Jack. (singing) Come, Josephine, in my flying machine. Up she goes, and up she goes. . . 
[Person1]:  Hello, is there anything I can do for you? [Person2]:  Yes. I would like to check in. [Person1]:  Have you made a reservation? [Person2]:  Yes. I am Belen. [Person1]:  So your room number is 201. Are you a member of our hotel? [Person2]:  No, what's the difference? [Person1]:  Well, we offer a 10 % charge for our members.
[Person1]:  May I take an order now?  [Person2]:  Yes, I think ready to order. Elitherbeth , What would you like to have?  [Person3]:  I haven't made my mind yet. You order first , Donald.  [Person2]:  Alright. Fish with chicken soup and I want to steak medium raw. I have a big potato green beans and make a salad. All of the dessert later. [Person1]:  Yes, sir. And you Miss. What would you like to have?  [Person3]:  I can't decide , I didn't see anything I really like.  [Person1]:  There are over thirty dishes to select from. Miss. [Person2]:  There must be something you should like, Elitherbeth. [Person3]:  Well, I guess so. But the only seafood that I don't hate is oysters. and I don't care for chicken and I don't like fish. Do you any oysters [Person1]:  No , Miss. I'm afraid not. How about some other seafood. ? [Person3]:  Oysters are the only seafood I like. I dislike the rest. [Person2]:  I wish they would have something for you.  [Person1]:  May I suggest tomato soup? Steak mushroom gravy, a curry and butter colifa for dessert , drop-very pie with ice-cream.
[Person1]:  International Film Club. [Person2]:  Hello, I'd like some information about the club, please? [Person1]:  Certainly, first of all, you must be over 15. Is that OK? [Person2]:  Yes, that's fine. I'm 16, are you open on Sunday. [Person1]:  I'm sorry, we aren't. When we started we opened from Tuesday to Friday, but now we open from Monday to Saturday. We get more people now. [Person2]:  Oh, OK. What about times? [Person1]:  We open the doors at 7 [Person2]:  Is it expensive? [Person1]:  It costs $7. 50 to see each film or you can pay for a month, which is cheaper, $15. 00. [Person2]:  That sounds good. What do I need to do now? [Person1]:  Why don't you come along this week, ask for me? My name is John Smith, my workmate can give me a call if I'm not here. [Person2]:  Great, and where are you? [Person1]:  We're behind the local library building, it's next to the bus station, opposite a bank. [Person2]:  OK, that's fine, thanks.
[Person1]:  Mrs. Thompson once ditheist, Jason. [Person2]:  Why? We shouldn't be in trouble or anything? In fact we were super active during the entire class discussion this morning. [Person1]:  That's just it. I don't think it's a bad thing at all. I think she is going to ask us to run for class monitor. [Person2]:  Whoa! Really? That's a lot of responsibility. [Person1]:  Well, I think you'd be great at it. Besides, it's a big honor to be asked to do it. It means that Mrs. Thompson sees us as leaders. [Person2]:  I'm not sure if I can do it by myself, though. Could we do it together? [Person1]:  Let's ask Mrs. Thompson. I hear her coming in from the hallway now.
[Person1]:  Won't you have some of this? [Person2]:  Yes, thanks. [Person1]:  It's my grandmother's favorite recipe for barbecue. [Person2]:  It's very good. How do you make it? [Person1]:  I use a special dressing and homemade catsup. [Person2]:  This salad looks so nice-just right for a hot day. [Person1]:  I'm glad you like it. [Person2]:  You Americans usually have nutritious food. [Person1]:  Oh, but Chinese food is so delicious. I wish I knew how to cook Chinese food. Do you follow recipes? [Person2]:  We use different spices but few people use recipes. They learn to cook by experience. [Person1]:  I always use a recipe but my grandmother never did. She was a great cook. She would make clam chowder and cornbread every Sunday night.
[Person1]:  Hello, miss. Can you bring me something to drink? [Person2]:  Sure, sir. But there is a charge for alcoholic beverages in economy class. Would you please refer to this price list? And then give me your order. [Person1]:  Thank you for reminding me. Well, please give me a glass of brandy and I will pay for it. [Person2]:  OK, I will bring it to you in a moment.
[Person1]:  There's a double feature at the cinema this Saturday. Do you want to go with me? [Person2]:  What are the movies that are playing? [Person1]:  There's an action movie with Harrison Ford and a chick flick with Susan Abandon. [Person2]:  I've never seen a movie I don't like that had Harrison Ford in it. [Person1]:  So, is that a yes? [Person2]:  Yes. What time does it start and do you want to meet me there? [Person1]:  It starts at one and yea, let's meet there. It's the cinema on the corner of Lincoln and Main. [Person2]:  Great! I have a coupon for free popcorn at that theater!
[Person1]:  Hi Rose, what are you busy with right now? [Person2]:  Hi Jack, I'm working on these documents. The manager wants them for half an hour. [Person1]:  Well, Rose, may I say something with you right now? [Person2]:  Is there something you need? [Person1]:  Are your free this weekend? [Person2]:  Yes, I have nothing to do. [Person1]:  Great, Is it convenient if i visit you this weekend? [Person2]:  I beg your pardon? [Person1]:  I'd like to call on you this weekend. I just want to a drop in for a chat. [Person2]:  Really? well, ok, you're welcome. [Person1]:  Is 5 PM. a good time for you? [Person2]:  Hmm, how about seven? I can treat you to dinner. [Person1]:  Sure, that would be great. I'll bring the wine. [Person2]:  OK. Then I'll be expecting you. [Person1]:  I'll be there on time.
[Person1]:  Alice, your father is amazing. He's 90 years old and he lives alone in that big house. [Person2]:  I know. He doesn't like to ask anyone for help. My dad insists on paying his own bills and taking care of himself! [Person1]:  That sounds like my Grandmother. She was always stubbornly independent. [Person2]:  It seems that folks like my father and your grandmother are determined to be on their own. [Person1]:  They see their independence as a kind of character strength. [Person2]:  Sometimes they are too independent.
[Person1]:  Are you watching the soccer match tonight? It must be the most exciting one in this season. [Person2]:  Well, of course I can't miss it. Which team are you for? [Person1]:  Manchester United. What about you? [Person2]:  Me too. Do you think they are going to get the championship this time? [Person1]:  I have confidence in them.
[Person1]:  Have you heard that Tom and his wife divorced? [Person2]:  I didn't hear that. But I can deduce the reason. [Person1]:  Really? Say it! [Person2]:  Tom is a kind guy, but addicted to gambling. He spends all his time gambling in the casino. And his wife can't put up with his incessant gambling any longer, so she divorced him. Is that right? [Person1]:  Yeah, quite right. Gambling broke up a happy family. [Person2]:  Yeah! Gambling is often a curse. By gambling we lose time and treasure, two things most precious to a man. [Person1]:  Besides that, many people took to gambling and got in over their heads, and gradually ruined themselves. [Person2]:  In a word, gambling is a vice. We should be away from it.
[Person1]:  Hello, could you tell me my test results? [Person2]:  Your results are posted on the website. Just put in your password and you can see the exact numbers. [Person1]:  Are you saying that all my results were normal? [Person2]:  We always contact you by phone to come in if there is a need for follow-up. [Person1]:  How will I know what the results mean on the website? [Person2]:  The purpose of each test is given on the site. [Person1]:  Will the numbers mean anything to me? [Person2]:  The website will give you your results and then tell you what the normal range is. [Person1]:  Can I see all of my test results at once? [Person2]:  Yes, you can see every test for the past five years. You can compare them.
[Person1]:  how did you do on your BELTS exam? [Person2]:  fantastic! I got an overall score of eight. [Person1]:  that's excellent! Have you received your conditional offers yet? [Person2]:  yes. I'm just waiting until I officially get admitted to the university with a conditional offer to apply for my visa. [Person1]:  do you know where the visa office is? [Person2]:  no. [Person1]:  it's just near the Dong Si Shi Tiao subway stop. [Person2]:  that's not too far away. Do you think I'll get a visa? [Person1]:  have you ever gone abroad before? [Person2]:  yes, I've been to Tailband, Egypt, and Japan. [Person1]:  have you ever been denied a visa before? [Person2]:  never. [Person1]:  that's good. Are you planning on immigrating to another country? [Person2]:  no, I want to come back to China after I graduate. [Person1]:  that's exactly what the visa officers want to hear. Do you have enough money for tuition and room and board? [Person2]:  I've received a full scholarship, so I won't need any other money to live off while I'm studying. [Person1]:  I think you have a very good chance of getting a visa. I can help you prepare for the visa interview if you want. [Person2]:  that's be great. The more prepared I am, the better.
[Person1]:  Excuse me. Could you give me some directions? [Person2]:  What are you looking for? [Person1]:  A gas station. My car ran out of gas two blocks back. [Person2]:  Walk straight ahead until you come to the second traffic light. Then turn right. [Person1]:  Do you know the name of the street? [Person2]:  I can't remember, but it's the second light. [Person1]:  By the way, do you know the price of the gas now? [Person2]:  I'm afraid I don't. But I do know the price has gone up. [Person1]:  Thanks a lot.
[Person1]:  Would you like to go to work or continue your studies after graduation? [Person2]:  I think I will continue my studies. Now it's not easy for a graduate with bachelor's degree to get a job since there are so many graduates with master's or doctor's degree. We are likely to lose in competing with them in the job market. [Person1]:  So you will continue to study for a master's degree? [Person2]:  Well, I think so. But I am thinking of going aboard to get a master's and doctor's degree. If can get a Ph. D. abroad, it will be much easy for me to get a job at home. [Person1]:  How can you finance your education abroad? It is very expensive to study abroad. [Person2]:  I think I will try to get the scholarship since I really don't have so much money to study abroad. Actually now I am preparing for the TEFL and GRE exams. If I can get high marks in the two exams and if I am lucky enough, I may get a scholarship. [Person1]:  It could be pretty tough studying abroad. Being so far away from home. . .
[Person1]:  Hello. [Person2]:  Is this Mr. Green's office? [Person1]:  Yes, it is. [Person2]:  Is he there? [Person1]:  I'm sorry, he isn't. He's at a meeting this morning. [Person2]:  What time will he be back? [Person1]:  He'll be back after two o'clock but he'll only be in the office for an hour. [Person2]:  Can I reach him in the conference room? [Person1]:  I'm sorry, but they aren't taking any calls. Can I take message for you? [Person2]:  This is Anne Lucas in the accounts office. I would like a word with him, please. [Person1]:  I can ask him to call you after the meeting. Can I have your number? [Person2]:  Yes, it's 488-6361. He can reach me there until three o'clock.
[Person1]:  Are you looking forward to a trip to Canada, Julie? [Person2]:  I can't wait to see Canada, Jack. But I'm afraid of the journey. My husband insists on flying, but I want to sail. Planes make me nervous. [Person1]:  There is nothing to be frightened of. How many planes fly across the Atlantic every day? [Person2]:  I've no idea. Hundreds, I suppose. [Person1]:  And how often do you hear of a plane accident? Once or twice a year? [Person2]:  Yes, but planes fly so high and fast that one accident is enough. [Person1]:  Look, there are more road deaths per day than air deaths per year. Air transport is really safe compared with road transport. [Person2]:  I'd still prefer to go by sea. Ships may not travel fast but at least you can relax. [Person1]:  It's fine if you are a good sailor, but have you ever traveled far in a rough sea? [Person2]:  No, I've only been in a boat once. I sailed down the river on a sightseeing tour. But in any case, I'd rather be seasick than dead.'
[Person1]:  If that man gives me any more letters to type, I'll scream. He's given me ten already today, and there'll be more when I get back from coffee break. I'll be here till midnight. [Person2]:  Calm down, Franny. He can't make you stay after five. Finish what you can, and leave the rest for Mary. [Person1]:  But they're important letters, Joe. They should go out tonight. [Person2]:  That's not your worry. If they're important, he should have given them to you earlier.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, please. [Person2]:  Yes? [Person1]:  Could you tell me the way to People's Park? [Person2]:  Yes. Go down this road. Turn right at the third crossing. Walk until you see a school. It's just opposite the school. [Person1]:  It sounds like quite a distance. [Person2]:  Yes, about half an hour's walk. [Person1]:  Can I take a bus there? [Person2]:  I'm afraid not. But you can take a taxi. [Person1]:  That's a good idea. Thank you very much. [Person2]:  It's my pleasure.
[Person1]:  Doctor! Doctor! Help me, please! [Person2]:  Take it easy, please! Sit here, now, what's the matter with you? And can I help you? [Person1]:  I feel sick. I have a bad stomach-ache, and my head troubles me a lot. [Person2]:  Well, let me have a check. Open your mouth please. And say 'Ah'. [Person1]:  Ah! Is that serious, doctor? [Person2]:  Not really. Did you have your supper this evening? [Person1]:  No, I only had some bananas. [Person2]:  And the bananas were not quite ripe, right? [Person1]:  Well, yes, they were a bit green. [Person2]:  That explains it. [Person1]:  I wish I had not eaten them. [Person2]:  Take this medicine twice a day and I'm sure you'll be fine. [Person1]:  Thanks, doctor. I'll do as you told me. Good-bye, doctor. [Person2]:  Bye! And take care.
[Person1]:  how are you doing?  [Person2]:  I'm ok. I wish I could say the same for my friend.  [Person1]:  what happened to him?  [Person2]:  he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving.  [Person1]:  was it his first offence?  [Person2]:  unfortunately not. He was charged with a DUI when he was in university.  [Person1]:  what happened to him then?  [Person2]:  not much; it was a minor offence back then. He got away with a fine of $500.  [Person1]:  did they take his license away?  [Person2]:  no, they were really easy on him. The problem is that that was a long time ago. They are much tougher on crime now.  [Person1]:  what do you think will happen to him?  [Person2]:  well, he'll definitely lose his license, pay a fine, and maybe even spend some time in jail.  [Person1]:  that doesn't sound too promising. Does he have a defence lawyer?  [Person2]:  not yet. If we can't find a lawyer for him, then the state will appoint him with one.  [Person1]:  my sister is a lawyer. I can ask her if she can help him.  [Person2]:  that'd be great! I know he'd appreciate your help. 
[Person1]:  are you good at making decisions?  [Person2]:  not really. Sometimes, I even let other people make key decision for me.  [Person1]:  what kinds of decisions do you leave to other people?  [Person2]:  there are basic decisions like which restaurant to go to. I can never seem to choose. I let my parents make big decisions for me. They chose my university and my course. I ended up studying something  [Person1]:  your parents will be choosing your girlfriend if you aren't careful! Why don't you try being more decisive? Start with some basic ones. When your friends are discussing which restaurant to eat at, make a decision for them. [Person2]:  that's a good idea. You're very decisive, I've noticed. So, which bar are we going to this evening?  [Person1]:  I can't make a decision. You'll have to put forward an idea.  [Person2]:  ok, i choose luckies.  [Person1]:  you see? You're becoming more decisive already! 
[Person1]:  You want to argue your ticket today? [Person2]:  Yes. That is why I'm here. [Person1]:  Tell me your argument. [Person2]:  I was pulled over for allegedly speeding. [Person1]:  Are you sure you weren't speeding? [Person2]:  To be honest, I really wasn't. [Person1]:  What speed were you going? [Person2]:  I was under the speed limit. I was going 35, when the speed limit was 40. [Person1]:  I'm just going to let you go, since the arresting officer isn't here. [Person2]:  What about my ticket? Do I still need to pay? [Person1]:  Don't worry about it. [Person2]:  I'm so glad for your help.
[Person1]:  Hey! What happened?! My song was only half way through and it skipped to the next song. [Person2]:  I don't know what happened! [Person1]:  You cancelled the song, didn't you, Jack? [Person2]:  No, I didn't. Really! [Person1]:  Then, is the machine broken or...
[Person1]:  ABC Company, my name is Lucy. How can I help you? [Person2]:  Hello, Lucy, this is Monica. I ' m calling for the accountant position. I saw the information about the vacancy on your company ' s website. Is it still available? [Person1]:  Thank you for your interest. The position is still available. Have you already sent your CV to us? [Person2]:  No, not yet. First, I want to check about the availability and see if you could give more information. [Person1]:  It is urgent for us to fill this position now and I would like to stress that English is a must because of the international contacts and most likely traveling abroad very soon. If all these is not problem for you, I recommend you to mention these in your cover letter and send it to me directly. [Person2]:  The notification period of my current job is not that long and I ' m quite profession to English and I am happy with the traveling abroad as I ' m good dealing with the people from other cultures. It makes the whole job even more interesting. I will send my resume to you still this week.
[Person1]:  Jane, what would you do if you were on vacation overseas and lost all your money and credit cards? [Person2]:  Well, I guess I'd probably sell my watch and camera... Or I might get a job as a waitress somewhere till I made enough money to buy a plane ticket to return home.
[Person1]:  Hey, buddy, can ' t you see there ' s a line? [Person2]:  Oh, sorry. I didn ' t know. [Person1]:  What? You haven ' t taken the bus before? [Person2]:  No, I ' m afraid not. [Person1]:  Well, you have to wait in line like everyone else. Besides, you should let old people on first. [Person2]:  Sorry. [Person1]:  It ' s all right. Where are you going? [Person2]:  I wanted to see the White House. [Person1]:  Oh, well you don ' t want this bus, anyway. It goes to Georgetown. [Person2]:  Oh, no. [Person1]:  It ' s all right, though. Just get off at the next stop and catch the 79A. [Person2]:  Oh, well thank you very much. [Person1]:  You ' re welcome.
[Person1]:  I met a girl in elevator this morning. She works in a company upstairs. She said she envied the casual way we dress for work in our company. She complained about the dress rule in her company. Their boss requires everyone to wear formal clothes from Monday to Friday. [Person2]:  Well, I was always wondering where those people with professional attire come from in this building. Now, I think I know the answer. [Person1]:  You know, in a sense, a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in July, and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees. Even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule, don't you think that is somehow too strict? [Person2]:  To some extent, it is. Anyway, whether they like it or not, they do give people a very good impression. [Person1]:  Yes, they do. But it is unjust to judge a book by its cover. If they are not happy or comfortable with their clothes, they can be less productive.
[Person1]:  Well, what did you think about the last candidate? Do you think we should hire her? [Person2]:  She had a very impressive resume, but she seemed to lack the confidence that I think a good manager needs. [Person1]:  What made you think that she wasn't very confident? [Person2]:  Did you notice the way that she avoided making eye contact with us while she talked? [Person1]:  She was a bit nervous, I guess. What else? [Person2]:  When she first walked into the room to greet us, she didn't shake our hands or introduce herself at all. I thought that was a bit unprofessional. [Person1]:  You're right. If she walked into meeting with our clients like that, it would make our company look bad, wouldn't it? [Person2]:  It sure would. Did you also notice the way she slouched in her chair during most of the interview? She had horrible posture! [Person1]:  I agree. I guess I was paying more attention to her answers than her body language. [Person2]:  On top of that, she didn't seem to have any sense of people's personal space. She didn't keep enough distance between us during the meeting. [Person1]:  That's true. I guess we'll have to keep looking for a manager then. [Person2]:  Don't worry, we'll find someone eventually!
[Person1]:  I'm sorry to have kept you waiting for such a long time. I didn't think the meeting would be so long. [Person2]:  That's all right, Dr. Green. I've got the data you required and a few reference books which I think may be useful to your representation at the conference.
[Person1]:  What a beautiful view, my sweetheart! [Person2]:  It sure is. The Grand Canyon is truly masterpiece. No man could ever make anything like this. [Person1]:  What is that below? [Person2]:  It is the Colorado River. You will go down the river in a boat if you wish. [Person1]:  No, thank you. It looks a bit too dangerous for me. [Person2]:  There is a beautiful state park here. I can see why so many people come out here to camp. [Person1]:  Yes, there is this beautiful view. you may go fishing, camping and also enjoy this beautiful clean air. [Person2]:  It definitely is a nice change from the polluted and crowded city. [Person1]:  You are so romantic, my sweetheart.
[Person1]:  Lucy, come here! I can see the lake which is in the center of park. [Person2]:  It is beautiful! Look, there are so many birds around it. [Person1]:  It is a great place for a relaxing vacation. [Person2]:  Listen to the sound of nature! It's like music. [Person1]:  Yeah, I agree. It makes you feel really good. [Person2]:  What are those? [Person1]:  Do you mean the red things? They are roses. [Person2]:  I'm going to take more pictures today. [Person1]:  Me, too.
[Person1]:  Simon, may I introduce you to Linda? You don't know each other, do you? [Person2]:  No. I've not had the pleasure of meeting her yet. [Person3]:  How do you do? I'm pleased to meet you. [Person2]:  How do you do? [Person3]:  Please sit down. Help yourself just like you are at home. [Person2]:  What would you like to drink? [Person3]:  A cup of coffee, please.
[Person1]:  Good afternoon, ma'am. Can I help you find anything? [Person2]:  No, thanks. I'm just looking. [Person1]:  We have a special on these skirts this week. Would you like to try one on? [Person2]:  No, thank you. I don't need any skirts. [Person1]:  How about a blouse? This one here is the latest fashion. [Person2]:  No, thank you. [Person1]:  Why not try on this lovely pair of shorts? I'm sure they'd look fabulous on you. [Person2]:  No doubt. Look, I'm just browsing. If I need your help, I'll let you know. [Person1]:  Take a look at this dress! Don't you think it's perfect for you, ma'am? Uh, where are you going, ma'am? Ma'am?
[Person1]:  Morning, Mr. Roberts, have you been to that new shop in the High Street. [Person2]:  Good morning, Mrs. White. Yes, I just thought I pop in and browse around, seeing if there is anything I like. I must say I'm very impressed. They have a very good literature section and there is a little care where you can go and read a book in peace. [Person1]:  Have they got any nice love stories? That's what I really like, a bit of romance and excitement.
[Person1]:  Speed Airlines Reservation. May I help you? [Person2]:  Yes. Do you have any flight to Paris on 15th? I want one leaving in the afternoon. [Person1]:  Yes. Flight DP336 leaves at 15 [Person2]:  Is it a direct flight? [Person1]:  No, Sir. It has an hour layover in London. [Person2]:  Well, I don't think I want it.
[Person1]:  Evan, are you busy right now? [Person2]:  Not really. What's up? [Person1]:  Well, I need a hand with the fax machine. My fax is not going through. [Person2]:  I'm kind of useless in that area, but I'll take a look at it. [Person1]:  Ah, thanks.
[Person1]:  I met a girl in elevator this morning. She works in a company upstairs. She said she envied the casual way we dress for work. She complained about the dress rule in her company. It requires everyone to wear formal clothes from Monday to Friday. [Person2]:  Well, I was wondering where those people with professional attire come from. Now, I know the answer. [Person1]:  You know, in a sense, a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in July, and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees. Even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule, isn't that strict? [Person2]:  To some extent, it is. Anyway, whether they like it or not, they do give people a very good impression. [Person1]:  But it is unjust to judge a book by its cover. If they're not happy or comfortable with their clothes, they can be less productive. I still believe wearing whatever people like is better. [Person2]:  Yes, I agree with you on this point.
[Person1]:  Jane, I hear that you are leaving school now. What do you want to do? Have you made up your mind yet? [Person2]:  No, not yet. But I think I'm going to take up singing. [Person1]:  Any special reasons? [Person2]:  Yes. It's because I am good at singing songs. All my classmates say so. Besides, singing is quite interesting and you can meet a lot of people. [Person1]:  And you will have to please them too. [Person2]:  Well, you do in any job, don't you? [Person1]:  And what do your parents think about it? [Person2]:  They don't quite agree with my idea. That is the only trouble. [Person1]:  Have they got any other plans for you, then? [Person2]:  Yes, um...they're trying to send me to an art college because they want me to be an actress. [Person1]:  Then what will you do? [Person2]:  Er...I haven't decided yet. But I usually get my own way in the end.
[Person1]:  What are you doing tonight?  [Person2]:  I have to run to the grocery store.  [Person1]:  Don't you hate fighting the crowds on the weekends?  [Person2]:  Yes, but I am out of food and milk.  [Person1]:  What store do you shop at?  [Person2]:  The small one, just down the street. I like their generic brand.  [Person1]:  I have been using the store across town for years.  [Person2]:  I hear they have very nice stuff.  [Person1]:  They do, but they're a little expensive on certain items.  [Person2]:  Well, you should try my store. The prices are good.  [Person1]:  I will sometime. Thanks for the advice. 
[Person1]:  What do you do in summer?  [Person2]:  I love going out into the countryside for walks or bike ride. I love being out in the fresh summer air. How about you?  [Person1]:  I don't often go for walks, but I either play sports outside-you know, tennis or badminton-or just sit in the sunshine and read a good book.  [Person2]:  What do you do in winter?  [Person1]:  Well, I play sports indoors quite often. If I'm feeling lazy, I just watch a film at home. I prefer summer to winter.  [Person2]:  I think most people do. I like wearing nice, colorful clothes in summer, you know, a nice dress or skirt. It's too cold for those kinds of clothes in winter.  [Person1]:  Yes. I like wearing shorts in summer. My legs would freeze!  [Person2]:  Do you think we'll have a nice summer this year?  [Person1]:  Thanks to global warming, it could be hotter than ever! 
[Person1]:  Where did you put my new red tie? [Person2]:  It's right there in the cupboard with your other ties. [Person1]:  There's a green one and a couple of brown ones, but no red one. [Person2]:  Here it is in your drawer. You must have put it there when you brought it home. [Person1]:  I suppose so. We'd better hurry up or we're going to be late. The Smiths said to come at 7 [Person2]:  Oh, it's 6 [Person1]:  She shall be here at 6 [Person2]:  Who else is coming tonight? [Person1]:  The Browns and the Franks. And Mrs. Johnson's sister will be there too. [Person2]:  Well. I think we'd better go down. Sue should be here pretty soon.
[Person1]:  How was your trip to New York? [Person2]:  It was fun. I took the train there. [Person1]:  I didn't know that a train went from Los Angeles to New York. [Person2]:  Well, it doesn't go there directly. First, I took a train North from Southern California to Seattle Washington, then I transferred to another train, this one went across the northern part of the country, from Seattle all the way to Chicago, Illonois. [Person1]:  How long did that part of the trip take? [Person2]:  45 hours. [Person1]:  Then how long did it take to get from Chicago to New York? [Person2]:  Another 20 hours, this time I had a window seat, and the view was amazing! High stayed up just to look, by the time I arrived in New York. I was exhausted! [Person1]:  Would you recommend traveling that way? [Person2]:  I think it's a great way to see the country, trains often travel near the coast or through other beautiful areas. But I wouldn't recommend it to someone who wants to save time, the whole trip took more than 3 days.
[Person1]:  I have been thinking of buying a house and would like to speak with you. [Person2]:  I have time to speak with you. Where would you like to purchase your house? [Person1]:  I am most interested in Pasadena or Arcadia, but would be open to other suggestions. [Person2]:  How many bedrooms and bathrooms do you need? [Person1]:  We have several generations of family living in our household and so need a very large home. [Person2]:  Do you need to be located in a particular school district? [Person1]:  It doesn ' t matter, as we do not have any children. [Person2]:  Is a view important to you, or would you rather be located on a lakeshore lot? [Person1]:  In a perfect world, we would like a home with a view of the lake. [Person2]:  Thank you for all of the information. I will help you find the perfect house for you.
[Person1]:  How much is it all together? [Person2]:  Let me see. The bell-bottom pants are $ 90 and the coat is $ 120. It comes to $ 210. [Person1]:  Is it possible for you to reduce the price? [Person2]:  I am sorry. It's a one-price shop.
[Person1]:  Good morning. Vane Theater, at your service. [Person2]:  Hello. I'm thinking about watching a Chinese traditional opera with a foreign girl. What's on this weekend? [Person1]:  Well, there will be charity performance on Saturday night. And also, there will be a solo concert by an opera star on Sunday night. [Person2]:  It's a good thing that I have choices here. Can you tell me about the one on Saturday? [Person1]:  Sure. It's to raise money for the homeless. [Person2]:  What about the performance itself? [Person1]:  Oh, it's a reserved opera named The Monkey Creates Havoc in Heaven. [Person2]:  Wow, a story about the clever Monkey King. It's a classic and children's favorite. [Person1]:  It surely is. And the cast is really the best. [Person2]:  Wonderful! How much is the ticket? [Person1]:  The price varies according to the seats. 300 for the front, 200 for the middle, and 50 for the back.
[Person1]:  Hey honey! Where were you? [Person2]:  I decided to take Kenny to the park and get some fresh air. [Person1]:  How was it? Were there a lot of kids? [Person2]:  It wasn't too crowded, but we had a great time! We got on the see-saw together, then went on a couple of different slides and then I tried to go with him in the jungle gym, but I didn't fit. [Person1]:  Sounds like fun! When we go he always just likes to play in the sandbox. [Person2]:  Yeah, but today he was really hyper. He even got on the monkey bars and then he went on to go on the swings for a half hour. I'm exhausted! [Person1]:  You should go to the park more often since you don't go to the gym anymore!
[Person1]:  I'm the Mortgage Advisor at this branch. You wanted a chat about housing loans? [Person2]:  Yes, I've found a wonderful property I wish to buy. Unfortunately, I just don't have access to the cash. [Person1]:  I see. It's a problem most of us face. May I ask what the purchase price is? [Person2]:  It's 600, 000 RIB. But I've already put down 200, 000 RIB, which is my absolute limit, so I'm looking for a loan of 400, 000 RIB. [Person1]:  So, you've already made a large initial deposit? That is good news. OK, let's have a look at your credit details and get this started. [Person2]:  I already have an account with you, so it should be pretty straight forward. [Person1]:  That is good, it should speed things up nicely.
[Person1]:  Um, which of them is the better typist? [Person2]:  Well, Mary types faster than Jones. But I think Jones types more carefully. [Person1]:  Is there any difference in their short hand? [Person2]:  Jones can certainly take down letter more quickly, but Mary's short hand is the best in her class. [Person1]:  How about languages? [Person2]:  Both of them speak excellent French. But I think Mary speaks German more fluently than Jones does. [Person1]:  Um. That doesn't really matter. Because we have more French visitors than German.
[Person1]:  What are you doing there with your mobile phone? [Person2]:  I'm moblogging! [Person1]:  Moblogging? what does that mean? [Person2]:  Oh, moblogging is a combination of the word'mobile'and'blogging'. It's another form of blogging. Users can publish blog entries to the web from a mobile phone or other mobile devices. [Person1]:  Sounds interesting! That must be very convenient. [Person2]:  Yes, you're right. I can blog wherever and whenever I'm on the move. It's especially good when I'm on a business trip and my laptop happens to be away from me. [Person1]:  How can you do that? [Person2]:  Well, if I simply want to write a few words, I'll send it by email or edit it all from the cell phone browser. [Person1]:  What if you want to publish some photos? [Person2]:  Then I'll shoot some pictures, re-size the images and upload them with text descriptions to my blog. [Person1]:  I see. Moblogging must have done a great favor for habitual bloggers like you. [Person2]:  You bet it!
[Person1]:  Hello, this is Lucie Jing calling from Lincoln Bank. May I speak to Mr. Was, please? [Person2]:  Speaking. [Person1]:  Ah, hello, Mr. Was. I'm just calling about your new credit card. It has arrived with us, so you can either come to collect it, or we can send it on to you. [Person2]:  Sending it won't be necessary. I'm actually coming in for a meeting with my Personal Banker this afternoon. [Person1]:  What perfect timing! [Person2]:  Indeed. Is there anything I need to do before I collect it? [Person1]:  Not really. But we do recommend you to read through our terms and conditions again before you sign the card, just in case there is something you aren't happy with. [Person2]:  I'm sure it'll be fine. How about my PIN number? [Person1]:  That will be sent on to you within 2 working days. Then, you can start using your new card. [Person2]:  Great. I'll be in later today. Thanks for calling. Bye.
[Person1]:  Did I do well on my test? [Person2]:  Do you want to know the honest answer? [Person1]:  Why wouldn't I want to know? [Person2]:  You had pretty bad scores. [Person1]:  Exactly what do you mean by bad? [Person2]:  You failed. [Person1]:  How'd I fail it? [Person2]:  There are a couple of reasons why you didn't pass. [Person1]:  What did I do wrong? [Person2]:  To sum it all up, you really just don't know how to drive. [Person1]:  Thanks. Will I be able to take a retest? [Person2]:  Sure you can, in about two and a half weeks.
[Person1]:  Did you watch the finale last night? My favorite singer won! [Person2]:  Oh, I love him too. He not only sings well but shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest. [Person1]:  Yeah, he got booted after his initial performance in the audition, but he did not give up. He then tried at another two auditions. [Person2]:  He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest. Fortunately, in the third audition, he has won popularity among the audience. And that's when I started to notice him. [Person1]:  Me too. [Person2]:  Before he made the top three, I was so nervous. I just fear that he might be knocked out. [Person1]:  Yeah, there're so many excellent candidates out there. Who knows which one will make it to the final? [Person2]:  Absolutely. That's why when he entered the finale, I was so excited. [Person1]:  He really did a great job in the finale, especially in the PK round. He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him. [Person2]:  And the host announced that he won it all!
[Person1]:  Good afternoon, Lincoln Corporate Services. Lina speaking, how may I help? [Person2]:  Hello, Lina. I'm calling about your new PIN scheme. I'm new to all of this, so some of my questions may sound a little ignorant. . . [Person1]:  That's not a problem, I'm more than happy to explain everything in laymen's terms. PIN stands for Personal Internet Banking. You can do all of your usual banking using the Internet, no need to call [Person2]:  I see. How about buying and selling items? [Person1]:  We can take care of that for you, too. You can get all of your usual banking services plus some new extra ones. As this service is net bases, you can do it anywhere. [Person2]:  That's good to know, because I do travel quite frequently.
[Person1]:  Flip it to channel 9, will you, Janet? There's a big basketball game on in a couple of minutes. [Person2]:  Sorry, turkey. I have already got dibs on the TV for tonight, remember? And I'm watching'Disco Fever'on channel 6. [Person1]:  Oh, yeah, smarty-pants? Over my dead body. Now, don't be such a brat and. . . [Person2]:  Hey, what's wrong with the TV? [Person1]:  I don't know! The picture went blank all of a sudden. It's probably the picture tube. [Person2]:  Looks like the TV wins that argument. [Person1]:  Yeah. Oh well, how about a game of cards instead? [Person2]:  Sure, why not?
[Person1]:  We have received your resume in answer to our ads. I would like to talk with you regarding your qualification for this position, OK? [Person2]:  It is my honor to have this chance for this interview. Well, my major is commercial English. You know, and I am not only familiar with useful English expressions in business, but also learn some theories on this field. Besides, during my college learning period, I also attended some commercial activities to strive for the opportunity of practicing what I learned. [Person1]:  What is your greatest weakness? [Person2]:  Well, I was a diligent student when I stayed in my college. I dislike meeting the deadline, when I am working on a project. I am always willing to complete it well ahead of the schedule. [Person1]:  What is the greatest disappointment in your life? [Person2]:  Well, I lost my grandpa when I was only ten. I often recall the period when he fed me. [Person1]:  Well done! Another question! When will you start work, if you are hired? [Person2]:  I will start my work at the beginning of next month.
[Person1]:  Where do you work, Andrea?  [Person2]:  I work for Thomas Cook Travel.  [Person1]:  Oh, really? What do you do there?  [Person2]:  I'm a guide. I take people on tours to countries in South America, like Peru.  [Person1]:  That sounds interesting !  [Person2]:  Yes, it's a great job. I love it. And what do you do?  [Person1]:  I'm a student, and I have a part-time job, too.  [Person2]:  Oh? Where do you work?  [Person1]:  In a fast-food restaurant.  [Person2]:  Which restaurant?  [Person1]:  Hamburger Heaven. 
[Person1]:  Do you usually feel nervous, anxious or scared during tests, Jane? [Person2]:  I used to. [Person1]:  How did you get over it then? [Person2]:  Believe it or not, tests don't mean that we should do extra work. Teachers and schools give us tests for very important reasons. Knowing it is very important for you. [Person1]:  I see, but sometimes it can't help. [Person2]:  Giving a test is a way for a teacher to see what the students have learned, and to find out who is having trouble. Then he can decide on the teaching plan. [Person1]:  That is what our head teacher often says in class. But I still can't control myself sometimes. [Person2]:  Sometimes schools have to prove that the students are learning and one way to do this is to have tests. [Person1]:  You are right. [Person2]:  And tests make sure that students do their homework. [Person1]:  Thanks. I feel much more comfortable now. [Person2]:  You can make it if you try hard.
[Person1]:  Dear audience, tonight we have Stephan Darcy with us in the studio. Congratulations on your book Life And Everything In Between Steven hit such a success. [Person2]:  Thank you. [Person1]:  This is your first attempt at poetry. Did you ever try it before? Did you take any classes in poetry? [Person2]:  Well, my only real experience was writing business plans. I've always had a good grasp of the English language, my mom encouraged me to read when I was very little. [Person1]:  What's the hardest thing about creating your work? [Person2]:  Finding the perfect words to fit what I wanted to say, there's always a word or 2 that I might still rewrite if given the chance. [Person1]:  Will there be more collections of poetry? [Person2]:  There will be more of something I suppose, but maybe not poetry. I really don't see myself as a poet. Rather, I see what I wrote as a kind of writing that might inspire people in some way.
[Person1]:  Can I help you, Miss? [Person2]:  I would like to order 2 office-style cabinets and desk calendars. We want office-style cabinets in white. The catalogue number is 90 - f - 2356. [Person1]:  How soon do you want it? [Person2]:  Could you deliver it tomorrow? [Person1]:  No problem. [Person2]:  Please handle the items carefully. [Person1]:  Certainly. [Person2]:  We will pay by collect on delivery.
[Person1]:  I have a question about my cable. [Person2]:  What do you need? [Person1]:  I haven't been able to watch my cable for the past week. [Person2]:  Right now the cable isn't working. [Person1]:  Could you tell me when it will be back on? [Person2]:  The cable should be running again in a couple of days. [Person1]:  In the meantime, do I still have to pay for the cable? [Person2]:  We'll just give you a credit for the inconvenience. [Person1]:  Does that mean I won't have to pay for it? [Person2]:  It'll be free until it comes back on. [Person1]:  Thanks, I appreciate your help. [Person2]:  Thank you for all your patience.
[Person1]:  Steward! [Person2]:  Yes, ma'am? [Person1]:  May I have a magazine or something? [Person2]:  Certainly. Just a moment. I'll be right back with one. Which do you prefer, one in English or in Chinese? [Person1]:  One in English, please. [Person2]:  All right, ma'am.
[Person1]:  Do you think I still fashionable in this dress? [Person2]:  I think so. Blue is still very fashionable at the moment. [Person1]:  This style came out last year, though. I like the dress, but I'm not sure whether last year's fashions will be same this year. [Person2]:  I think this kind of dress will stay in fashion for a few more years. People don't change fashions every year. It would be too expensive. [Person1]:  Yes. Only the top designer try to tell people to change fashion every year, but only rich people can do it. [Person2]:  There are some real fashion victims who just have to keep totally up-to-date with expensive clothes. [Person1]:  I wish I could be one of those people, but my budget simply doesn't stretch that far. I have to limit the amount of money I spend on clothes otherwise I would go on a shopping frenzy. [Person2]:  I know what you mean. The situation will be worse if we marry our boyfriends and have children. The we'll have even less money to spend on fashionable clothes!
[Person1]:  How do you do? I need your help in selecting a foreign market to invest! [Person2]:  Fine. I have your letter and I've made some notes. [Person1]:  How can I find out what countries to invest? [Person2]:  We have quite a lot of import and export information and can give you figures on population, consumption, production, and foreign exchange reserves. [Person1]:  Great. I want to get an idea for the purchasing ability in various countries. [Person2]:  But you're also going to have to give some attention to trade restrictions. You can get much information about environment of investment.
[Person1]:  Hello, is this Professor Clark? [Person2]:  Yes, I am Professor Clark. [Person1]:  Hello, Professor, this is Kalina, and I am in your literature class on Monday mornings. [Person2]:  Yes, how are you doing? [Person1]:  I was partying hard over the weekend, fell down the stairs, and need time to recuperate. [Person2]:  That sounds painful. Are you going to be OK? [Person1]:  I sprained my wrist, but the doctor says it will be fine. [Person2]:  How many days will you be out of school? [Person1]:  The doctor said I should be good enough to return next week. [Person2]:  I am glad you let me know that you will be missing class. Get well!
[Person1]:  Can I help you? [Person2]:  I want to buy a hat. [Person1]:  Come here, please. [Person2]:  Is this one fit for you? It is nice. [Person1]:  I don't like the style. [Person2]:  How about this one? [Person1]:  Black is not my favorite colour. [Person2]:  You must like this pink one, don't you? [Person1]:  It's pretty. How much is it? [Person2]:  Fifty yuan. [Person1]:  It's too expensive. Can you come down a little? [Person2]:  How about forty-five? [Person1]:  I'll buy it if forty. [Person2]:  OK.
[Person1]:  Did your company go union? I heard that many companies in out industry are being unionized, so It's getting harder and harder to compete on a level playing field.  [Person2]:  Yes, we're hopping on the bandwagon and signing up for the union. Mostly people are pretty happy about it... I guess it depends on if you are in management or in the labor force.  [Person1]:  Management isn't looking on the labor unions too favorably, I'd guess. I don't blame them... labor unions can really put the squeeze on the executives.  [Person2]:  Sure... but it's probably better for the workers, because the union's whole purpose is to look out for the little guys. The only way that the little guys can take on the big bosses is if they unite. Labor unions are all about getting a voice for the underdog. 
[Person1]:  Next is a ballet performance, but who is the dancer? [Person2]:  I'd swear that's Eddy from circulation. [Person1]:  Since when did Eddy start doing ballet? ! [Person2]:  Not very long from the looks of it! [Person1]:  Look! He has a partner! [Person2]:  He's dancing with Jack! [Person1]:  Gross! [Person2]:  The wei-ya is the one time a year you can make fun of the boss. [Person1]:  But I think Eddy is going too far! [Person2]:  You're right. They are spinning pretty fast. Aren't they getting dizzy? What if they fall. . . [Person1]:  Oh! Ouch! That must've hurt! [Person2]:  How embarrassing!
[Person1]:  Hi, Mary, you have been a secretary for several years in this company. Could you tell me what a secretary should do for a meeting or a conference? [Person2]:  Well, an important part of the duties of a secretary, I think, is to do well the preparation work for the meeting. [Person1]:  What should a secretary do to prepare for a meeting? Can you tell me a bit more about it? [Person2]:  First of all, the agenda should be prepared before the meeting. Then you should ensure that those entitled to be present are properly informed. [Person1]:  I see, and how about the documents and the information? [Person2]:  All the necessary documents and the information relevant to the meeting should be available, preferably printed and distributed before the meeting. [Person1]:  And what should a secretary do during the meeting? [Person2]:  Of course, she should take minutes. [Person1]:  And after the meeting? [Person2]:  After the meeting she should type the minutes up, and then keep proper records of the business transacted and the resolutions passed and also implement many of the decision reached at the meeting. [Person1]:  It's seriously good.
[Person1]:  Hello, I have a reservation for a double. [Person2]:  What's your last name? [Person1]:  It's Smith. Here is my driver's license. [Person2]:  Yes, I do show your reservation. How could you like to pay for the room? [Person1]:  I'd like to put it on my VISA. [Person2]:  Fine. Here is your room key, here is also a map of our hotel. The swimming pool, gym and sauna are all located on first floor. [Person1]:  Great, is our room ready yet? [Person2]:  Yes. If you want to order room service, just press 0 on your phone, and that will connect you with the front desk.
[Person1]:  I'll pick you up at a quarter to eleven tomorrow morning. [Person2]:  How long will the journey last? [Person1]:  It's a three and an half hours drive. And we should give ourselves forty minutes to have lunch and another ten to wait for the ferry.
[Person1]:  Hello, Mr. Jan Erick Freedman. You're a frequent traveler. And we also know that you eat out twice a day. How come you're so fond of eating out? [Person2]:  When I got my first job back in 1982 and started travelling, I had no other choice but eat out. I found that I felt different due to what I was eating, so I tried to find places that served food that made me feel good. The secret was the quality of the food and how well the food was prepared. I made an effort to find good restaurants as well as nice dishes. [Person1]:  How did you manage to make a list of 218 favorite restaurants? [Person2]:  I've lived in many cities and when I moved back to Sweden from the United States, people asked me where to go and eat when they went to cities I knew. I got a lot of ideas. Then I wrote about restaurants for the Swedish club magazine and someone suggested I gather the information about the restaurants together since I had all the facts about the restaurants I've been to. I started to do that. [Person1]:  How do you find restaurants? [Person2]:  The best way is to ask the people there. I may talk to the people at the street market or take a walk and look for a place for myself. I never asked a hotel clerk or a taxi driver. I don't go empty restaurants or places with menus too difficult to understand.
[Person1]:  Hmm... Here's one of a crowd of people moving. I think that's pretty stressful. [Person2]:  Well, I don't think it's so bad. But I do think that going to the dentist is stressful. [Person1]:  Oh, so do I! It's stressful because you have no control. [Person2]:  That's right. Look at this one. This poor boy is sitting in an exam. I think exams are the most stressful. Sometimes you just can't think of anything to write. [Person1]:  Yes, I agree with you there. What about these people here? [Person2]:  Mmm... I'm not sure. They seem to be in a hurry, don't they? I think being late is stressful. [Person1]:  That's true. It can be terrible, especially when you're late for something important. [Person2]:  Like an interview. Look at this picture here [Person1]:  No. I think they're quite exciting, a challenge. [Person2]:  Oh, I hate interviews.
[Person1]:  Those birds love my yard. See? They are probably looking for worms. [Person2]:  Yeah, they are lucky they can find meals in lots of places. We have to go to the grocery store to buy our food. [Person1]:  True, but I wouldn't want to eat what they do, even if it's free.
[Person1]:  David, we shouldn't sit here doing nothing. [Person2]:  Why not? It's Saturday afternoon, isn't it? [Person1]:  Yes, but there's so much to do around the house. [Person2]:  It can wait. [Person1]:  We ought to finish washing down the kitchen walls and cupboards. [Person2]:  We can do that tomorrow. We don't have to do it today. [Person1]:  All right. But we must do it tomorrow, because the painters are coming on Monday. [Person2]:  Yes. And that reminds me. I must do something about that leak under the kitchen sink. [Person1]:  That's a good idea. [Person2]:  Talking about washing down the kitchen-where's Bob? [Person1]:  He's having lunch with Georgia. [Person2]:  What! Again? [Person1]:  He should be in soon. [Person2]:  He shouldn't spend so much time with that girl. [Person1]:  You must be patient, David. Nineteen's a very difficult age, you know. [Person2]:  Yes, I know. But he ought to be studying more.
[Person1]:  I've heard that you provide very good service, so when I need a mover, I call you guys first.  [Person2]:  Thanks a lot for calling us. Could you tell me more about what you need us to do?  [Person1]:  Oh, you see, we are on the 8th floor, and moving into the 6th floor in another building. It is about 15 kilometers to get there.  [Person2]:  OK, the cost depends on the floor to move to, the distance between two places and the amount of the furniture to move.  [Person1]:  How much will it cost in that case?  [Person2]:  Oh, let me see. It fits the second standard rates. Have a look at the contract, please.  [Person1]:  Your charge is divided into two parts, the Payment in Advance and the rest. I thought that I should pay all of it before moving.  [Person2]:  No, firstly we sign the contract; you pay 50% of what it costs, and the rest when we finish moving.  [Person1]:  The damage and compensation item confuses me. Could you give some explanation?  [Person2]:  OK. If any of the articles was damaged during moving, you may make a claim for compensation with our department. 
[Person1]:  Hello Richard. [Person2]:  Hi Karen. [Person1]:  How have you been? [Person2]:  Not too good. [Person1]:  Why? Is there anything bothering you? [Person2]:  I'm sick. [Person1]:  Oh, I am so sorry to hear that. Is it very serious? [Person2]:  It's OK. It's not serious. [Person1]:  That's good. How's your wife? [Person2]:  She's good. [Person1]:  Is she in the United Kingdoom now? [Person2]:  No, she's not here yet. [Person1]:  Where is she? [Person2]:  She's in Canada with our kids. [Person1]:  I see. I have to go now. Please tell your wife I said hi. [Person2]:  OK, I'll talk to you later. [Person1]:  I hope you feel better. [Person2]:  Thanks.
[Person1]:  What would you do if you won $1,000,000? [Person2]:  Oh, I don't know. I guess I'd buy a car. [Person1]:  That doesn't sound very interesting. [Person2]:  Well, what would you do? [Person1]:  I would go on a trip around the world. [Person2]:  Where would you go? [Person1]:  The first place I'd go to is Paris. I have always wanted to go shopping in Paris. [Person2]:  That's a good idea. You can spend some of your money there. [Person1]:  Yes, and then I think I'd go to Rome. I love Italian food best. [Person2]:  Me too. [Person1]:  After that I'd go to Egypt to see the Pyramids, and then to Australia to see the Great Barrier Reef. But after that, I'm not sure where I go. Where would you go? [Person2]:  If I was on a trip like that, I'd go to Germany to see where they make BMWs. [Person1]:  Of course, you love those cars. [Person2]:  Yes, that's true. But I would also like to watch a football match. The German team is my favorite.
[Person1]:  Hi, my wife just called me and asked me to pick up a dress that she had dry cleaned. The name is Doris Lockhart. [Person2]:  Do you have the number with you? We have everything arranged by number, not by name. [Person1]:  My wife didn't say anything about numbers. Look, there must be some way you can find it. She needs that dress for a dinner dance we are attending tonight. [Person2]:  I can look it up if you remember what day she brought it in. I can match her name up with the number in my order book.
[Person1]:  What can I do for you? [Person2]:  I'm here to see Mister Romero. [Person1]:  Do you have an appointment, sir? [Person2]:  Yes, my last name is Clark. [Person1]:  Jordan Clark? [Person2]:  Yes, that's me. [Person1]:  Wait, one moment, Mister Clark. I'll just check to make sure Mister Romaero is in his office. [Person2]:  Perhaps I'll use the restroom while I wait. Is there a men's room nearby? [Person1]:  Yes, just head back toward the elevators, you'll see one on the right. [Person2]:  Thank you very much.
[Person1]:  What can I do for you? We have many new introduced choose to choose from. [Person2]:  Sorry I bought a pair of shoes with the size of 42 for my husband, but it's a little tight for him. [Person1]:  OK. Show me your receipt and you can change a larger size. [Person2]:  I have to change one pair with the size of 43? [Person1]:  Here you are. Is this perfect for him? [Person2]:  Yes, and he would like brown rather than black to match his suit. [Person1]:  I see. Here are the brown shoes with the right size. [Person2]:  Thanks! Need I pay for extra money for the larger shoes? [Person1]:  You needn't if you still choose shoes with the same brand.
[Person1]:  Hello, Ann. [Person2]:  Oh, hello. Come on in. Let me take your coat. You managed to find us then. [Person1]:  Well, I got a bit lost coming off the ring road. Sorry I'm a bit late. [Person2]:  Oh, don't worry. The dinner hasn't been ready yet. Martin is still in the kitchen. [Person1]:  So he is cooking, isn't he? [Person2]:  He is quite an expert in the kitchen. Fortunately for me, I can't boil an egg myself. [Person1]:  Oh, I brought you this. I wasn't sure what you liked. But obviously, it's meant to be quite a good year. [Person2]:  Oh, thanks. Lovely.
[Person1]:  Good morning, sir. What can I do for you? [Person2]:  I'm Bill. I'm in Room 908. Can you change the room for me? It's too noisy. My wife was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made. She said it was too much for her. [Person1]:  I'm awfully sorry, sir. I do apologize. Room 908 is at the end of the corridor. It's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when all is quiet. [Person2]:  Anyhow, I'd like to change our room. [Person1]:  No problem, sir. We'll manage it, but we don't have any spare room today. Could you wait till tomorrow? The American People-to-people Education Delegation will be leaving tomorrow morning. There'll be some rooms for you to choose from. [Person2]:  All right. I hope we'll be able to enjoy our stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep. [Person1]:  Be sure. I'll make a note of that. Everything will be taken care of. And if there is anything more you need, please let us know.
[Person1]:  What's wrong with you, young man? [Person2]:  Doctor, I have a bad cough and a headache. [Person1]:  Do you have a fever? [Person2]:  I don't know, but I feel terrible. [Person1]:  Let me examine you. Don't worry. It's nothing serious. [Person2]:  Do you think I should lie in bed? [Person1]:  Yes, stay in bed and drink a lot of water. Your fever will be gone in a day or two. [Person2]:  OK. Do you think I can play football tomorrow? [Person1]:  Of course not. You need a good rest. [Person2]:  OK, I'll listen to you.
[Person1]:  Hey Mel! Are you up for some tennis today? [Person2]:  Sorry, I can ' t! I have to go to work, pick up Jake and Maddie from school, and make them an afternoon snack, then take Jake to soccer practice and Maddie to dance class. [Person1]:  You sound exhausted. Maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out! She can pick the kids up and take them to their after-school activities. She can also help you do some household chores, and run so [Person2]:  Oh, I don ' t know... it ' s hard to find the right nanny. You have to consider her previous work experience, the responsibilities you give her, and how she interacts with the kids. I would love to have [Person1]:  I think you should definitely consider it! This way you won ' t have to juggle such a busy schedule, and you ' ll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings. I can refer you this great [Person2]:  Oh, that ' s great. Thanks Grace. Can you give me her number? I ' ll talk it over with Dan and give her a call tomorrow. Maybe this way I won ' t be so tired every day, and Dan and I might even get to go
[Person1]:  Finding an excuse is obviously down your alley. And trying to avoid taking care of the children is what you are good at. [Person2]:  Listen, Nancy. If I don't work hard, I will be laid off. [Person1]:  You are passing the buck. I'll be hanged if I ask you to go to the park with us. [Person2]:  Come on, Nancy. Play it cool. I go with you and burn the middle night oil tonight.
[Person1]:  How may I help you? [Person2]:  I need to get on the Internet. [Person1]:  Do you have your library card with you? [Person2]:  Yes, I have it. [Person1]:  You're going to have to wait for a computer. [Person2]:  That's okay. [Person1]:  Please put your name on this list. [Person2]:  Then what do I need to do? [Person1]:  When there is a computer available, I will call you. [Person2]:  What do I do to log on to the computer? [Person1]:  Just type in the number on the back of your library card. [Person2]:  Okay. Thanks for your help.
[Person1]:  Do you like this dress, madam?  [Person2]:  I like the colour very much. It's a lovely dress, but it's too small for me.  [Person1]:  What about this one? It's a lovely dress. It's very smart. Short skirts are in fashion now. Would you like to try it?  [Person2]:  All right. I'm afraid this green dress is too small for me as well. It's smaller than the blue one. I don't like the colour either. It doesn't suit me at all. I think the blue dress is prettier. Co  [Person1]:  I'm afraid I haven't got a larger dress. This is the largest dress in the shop. 
[Person1]:  Would you find any other available flight to Tokyo? [Person2]:  Sure. We try our best. [Person1]:  Thank you. [Person2]:  Mr. Chen, are you sure you're taking BA - 007 back to Tokyo? [Person1]:  Yes, of course. I think our travel agent would have made the reservation for us. [Person2]:  I'm afraid this flight is all booked up. [Person1]:  Are you sure? We can't really take it? I reconfirmed with Miss Peterson the other day. [Person2]:  I'm afraid so except we have many no-show passengers.
[Person1]:  Mark, can you dress the twins for me while I take a shower? [Person2]:  You don't know what you are asking! [Person1]:  Please! You can do it. Their clothes are all laid out on the bed. [Person2]:  Remember what happened last time? [Person1]:  Are you referring to KC getting her head stuck in the pant leg? [Person2]:  Yes. That was a bit terrifying for both of us. [Person1]:  Don't worry! Today they are wearing dresses! [Person2]:  Oh, in that case, sure! Uh. . . what are these long sock-looking things?
[Person1]:  Hello. Is everything OK? Can I help you? [Person2]:  Oh, wonderful! You speak English! I need to exchange this foreign currency. [Person1]:  That's no problem. Is it cash? [Person2]:  It's Traveller's Cheques, is that possible? [Person1]:  Of course. If you could sign your name on the bottom line here, and write your address here. And please sign and date the back of every cheque and of course I'll need to see your passport. [Person2]:  Yes, right, certainly. Here you go.
[Person1]:  Are you Miss Thou Ping? [Person2]:  Yes. I am Thou Ping. [Person1]:  How do you spell you first name? [Person2]:  Ping. P-I-N-G. [Person1]:  Do you have an English name? [Person2]:  Yes, sir. It is Jane. It was given by my English professor when I was at the university. [Person1]:  What's your pen name? [Person2]:  My pen name is'Dark Blue'. [Person1]:  How do you like your name? [Person2]:  I like it very much. My name has became part of me. I don't want to change it. [Person1]:  What's your present permanent address? [Person2]:  My present address is No. 21 South Zhongshan Road, Apt. 19, Shanghai. The post code is 220150. [Person1]:  You look very young. How old are you? [Person2]:  Actually, I'm thirty now. [Person1]:  Where were you born? [Person2]:  I was born in Xinjiang. [Person1]:  What is your nationality? [Person2]:  Han.
[Person1]:  What is my ideal weight? [Person2]:  It depends on your height and body type. [Person1]:  How can I avoid injuring myself during exercise? [Person2]:  By warming up before and cooling down after your workout. [Person1]:  Sir, tell us about your experience with Super Bulk-up. [Person2]:  Well, it's completely changed my life. [Person1]:  Tell us how. [Person2]:  Well, before, I was the skinniest guy on the beach. [Person1]:  And now? [Person2]:  Just look! In six short weeks I've put on 30 pounds of pure muscle. [Person1]:  Wow! All because of Super Bulk-Up.
[Person1]:  It looks delicious. I will order it.  [Person2]:  I am sorry, sir, it's for 4 persons to have. I think it's too large for you.  [Person1]:  Would you please make it for a single person?  [Person2]:  Sorry, sir. We have never done that before. 
[Person1]:  Excuse me. May I see the manager of your store? [Person2]:  I am the manager. Can I help you? [Person1]:  Oh, great, I saw a job ad outside your store. I am interested in the job advertised. I am coming to see if there is any opportunity available for me. [Person2]:  All right. Take a seat, please. Would you like to be a shop assistant or a cashier? [Person1]:  I can do the work of shop assistant and I worked part time in a small department store during my summer vocation last year. [Person2]:  So now do you want a full-time job or part-time job? [Person1]:  At present, both are OK for me. What do you need most, then? [Person2]:  Now we really need some part-time workers. You see, our full-time staff knocks off at five pm, but now we hope to extend the hours to eight pm. We need some part-time shop assistants to work 3 hours a day from five pm to eight pm. But I am not sure if you are qualified for the job. Since most of our customers are foreign, competence of good communication in English is necessary here. [Person1]:  I think I can. I have been learning English for almost 5 years and especially I am fluent at speaking English. Also, I have made some foreigners friends during the experience of learning English. [Person2]:  That is fine. I think you have the qualifications needed for the job, so I will let you have the job. Does the work schedule suit you? [Person1]:  It quite suits me. I am free in the evening these days, I will have no difficulty starting at five pm. [Person2]:  Good. There is only thing to be settled. Ten RMB an hour is the maximum we can pay you. Is the rate of pay acceptable to you? [Person1]:  It seems reasonable. By the way, I can get my earning raised with a excellent performance, can't I? [Person2]:  Sure. You will get more if you can invite more customers with your good service. [Person1]:  I see. I will try my best to do the job well. [Person2]:  That is good of you to say so. When can you start working? [Person1]:  How about next monday? [Person2]:  Ok. Let's make is next Monday. I n the end, you need to fill out the application form. [Person1]:  Thank you for your kindness, ma'am. See you next Monday.
[Person1]:  The report says all the departments are making a profit except the Asian Department. [Person2]:  Well, Mr. Smith seems to be the wrong person to head that department. One more step wrong and he would be removed from that office.
[Person1]:  We can have eight days off at last. What are you going to do? [Person2]:  You know traveling is my hobby. Let's go to Beijing and have our holidays there. [Person1]:  That's a good idea. Beijing is one of the most modern cities in the world. There are many places of interest there. And the 2008 Olympic Games were held there. [Person2]:  How should we go there, by plane or by train? [Person1]:  I think we should go there by train. It's comfortable and cheap. [Person2]:  Though it's cheaper, it's slower. Let's go by plane. We can look down at the Great Wall of China from the plane. [Person1]:  OK. Let's go by plane. [Person2]:  Then we'd better book the tickets first. I have heard it is very difficult to get air tickets to Beijing. [Person1]:  That's right. And we'd better book the rooms too.
[Person1]:  Welcome, Miss. May I help you? [Person2]:  I hope so. I want a lipstick. [Person1]:  Do you have any particular brand in mind? [Person2]:  I like Lyfel very much. [Person1]:  We have different shades of Lyfel lipstick. May I know what color you usually wear? [Person2]:  Pink. But today, I'm thinking of buying one in a dark shade. You know, I will be a teacher next month. I wish to look more serious. [Person1]:  Yes, I see. How do you like this one? [Person2]:  Not too bad. May I have a try? [Person1]:  Certainly, Miss. [Person2]:  Mmm... It's still too bright. Any darker shades? [Person1]:  Not from the Lyfel group, I'm afraid. [Person2]:  Well, any brand will do as long as I can get the right color. [Person1]:  How about this one, then? It has more transparent touch. [Person2]:  OK, that's the very thing I need.
[Person1]:  Can I help you, sir?  [Person2]:  Yes, I'd like to look at some suits.  [Person1]:  Oh, this way please. What size do you wear?  [Person2]:  Size 41. I want something in dark flannel.  [Person1]:  How about this one?  [Person2]:  It feels all right. But if it were a darker color, I'd like it better. This seems too light for winter. Do you think you could get me one?  [Person1]:  All right. I'll show you something darker. Do you like this one?  [Person2]:  It looks good. But can I try it on?  [Person1]:  Of course. Let me help you.  [Person2]:  Thanks. It's comfortable. Well, how much is it, please?  [Person1]:  $280.  [Person2]:  Ok. I'll take it. Here's the money. 
[Person1]:  How were things in the Tokyo branch when you were there?  [Person2]:  Good! They have expanded and are doing better than they were last quarter. It's nice to see some improvement for a change.  [Person1]:  Do you see the trend continuing over the next few months?  [Person2]:  Yes, especially with so many of our executives going back and forth from here to Japan. The only problem is, they may have trouble when they go to open up business here.  [Person1]:  Why would you say that?  [Person2]:  They aren't too familiar with doing business outside of Japan. There are a lot of cultural differences to account for.  [Person1]:  I'll say! Sometimes they just do things really differently. But one thing I can say, they are really hospitable.  [Person2]:  Have you ever been to Japan?  [Person1]:  Sure! I just got back yesterday. I'm still suffering from jet lag. 
[Person1]:  How about you, Chuck? Where did you grow up?  [Person2]:  Well, I was born in Ohio, but I grew up in Texas.  [Person1]:  And when did you come to Los Angeles?  [Person2]:  In 1978. I went to college here.  [Person1]:  Oh. What was your major?  [Person2]:  Drama. I was an actor for five years after college.  [Person1]:  That's interesting. So why did you become a hairdresser?  [Person2]:  Because I needed the money. And because I was good at it. Look! What do you think? 
[Person1]:  What are you doing, Jane? [Person2]:  I am planning a party. [Person1]:  A party? What party? Your birthday party? [Person2]:  Of course not. My birthday is in December, don't you remember? It's the company's party. The general manager wants to invite some famous scientists, bankers and professors from universities to the party. These people are very important to the development of the company. [Person1]:  Have you finished all the planning? [Person2]:  Finished? You must be joking. I have just started. I still need to get a lot more information and I'll have to write many invitation letters. [Person1]:  Can I help you? [Person2]:  Would you? That would be very nice. Let me tell you what to do first.
[Person1]:  I'm really sorry Madam, I missed your lecture because I was ill yesterday. [Person2]:  I'm not upset that you couldn't keep the appointment, but you didn't call me when someone doesn't turn up and doesn't call it makes someone else wait. [Person1]:  You're right, I apologize. I didn't feel well and I guess I just wasn't thinking of calling you at the time. [Person2]:  OK apology accepted. Now, I suppose you need to set up another appointment. [Person1]:  Yes, I do. But I'm really worried about my project. Can you see me now if I wait? [Person2]:  No, but I can see you at 3 [Person1]:  Great. Your office hours are best at 2 [Person2]:  OK, be there in time by then. [Person1]:  I promise I will not him.
[Person1]:  What shall we do when we find a shortage in the shipment? [Person2]:  You should do one of the two things - either to lodge a claim with the shipowner or with the insurance company. [Person1]:  Shall we leave it to the brokers? [Person2]:  Yes. They usually do it. [Person1]:  Do they charge for that? [Person2]:  Of course. In Europe, they charge a commission of 1 % of the amount of the claim for their service. [Person1]:  Is it the same in America? [Person2]:  They do the work without charge to the importer. [Person1]:  It's part of their service, isn't it? [Person2]:  Exactly. [Person1]:  Is it enough to claim with an on board bill of lading? [Person2]:  No, you must also obtain a statement from the shipping agent certifying that the goods were actually loaded on their vessel for shipment. [Person1]:  I see. By the way, how do we prove the ownership of our goods? [Person2]:  You must provide full original set of ocean bills of lading original insurance policy or certificate and the original commercia invoice. [Person1]:  I see. Thank you. [Person2]:  You are welcome.

[Person1]:  Recently I have been getting headache and my eyes don't seems to see focus properly. [Person2]:  When did you last time have your eyes checked? [Person1]:  Two years ago. At that time I had no problems.Now I can ' t even make out something ten meters away. [Person2]:  Come over here. I will test your eyes. First cover your left eye like this, and when I point, please read the chart from the top, and go as far as you can, telling me which way the ' E ' points. [Person1]:  All right. [Person2]:  Good.Now the other eye. [Person1]:  Well, this one is worse. [Person2]:  Never mind, just read as far as you can. [Person1]:  I can only read the first three lines.
[Person1]:  Have you washed any clothes yet? [Person2]:  No, I've only washed my whites. [Person1]:  When you wash your dark clothes, can you put some of mine in? [Person2]:  Sure. Is there any extra care that I should take with your clothes? [Person1]:  Just make sure you keep it on the gentle cycle. [Person2]:  How many clothes of yours do you want me to wash? [Person1]:  There isn't a lot, why, do you have a large load to wash? [Person2]:  It's really only a small load. [Person1]:  Do you mind washing my clothes? [Person2]:  Not at all. It's no problem. [Person1]:  Thank you so much. [Person2]:  It's no trouble at all.
[Person1]:  Good morning, Miss Wang. How beautiful you look today! [Person2]:  Thank you. I'm wearing make-up. [Person1]:  Who taught you to put on make-up? [Person2]:  It's me. I have studied make-up at a beauty shop. [Person1]:  Can you teach me how to do make-up? [Person2]:  Of course. First, use eye shadow to heighten your eyes. [Person1]:  What eye shadow do you think is the most fit for me? [Person2]:  I think pink eye shadow is popular among Chinese girls. [Person1]:  How do you protect yourself from chapped lips? [Person2]:  I suggest you use lipstick, which also accentuates your lips. [Person1]:  How did you grow such long nails? [Person2]:  You have to pay attention to trimming them from time to time.
[Person1]:  Veronica! Veronica! Veronica! Are you OK? [Person2]:  Steven! What's going on! Who were those guys? I didn't know you have a gun! What's going on! [Person1]:  I will come clean as soon as we get to safety, OK? For now, you have to trust me, please! I would never do anything to hurt you. [Person2]:  Steven, I. . . [Person1]:  I haven't been completely honest with you Veronica, I'm sorry. I'm not a fireman. I'm not even from the United States. I'm a spy for the Indian government. [Person2]:  What? Why didn't you tell me before? What are you doing here? [Person1]:  When I was a young boy, I used to play cricket my father back in my hometown of Hyderabad. It was a peaceful town, and my father was a renowned chemist. One day, he was approached by members of the CIA, claiming that my father had made the discovery of the millennium in his small lab back at the university where he taught bio-chemistry. I never saw him again. I vowed to discover the whereabouts of my father and consequently joined the Indian Intelligence Bureau. [Person2]:  What does that have to do with those men shooting at us? Most importantly, why did you lie to me! [Person1]:  I'm sorry, I wasn't supposed to meet you. I wasn't supposed to fall in love with you, but you have to believe me when I tell you that what I feel for you is real. [Person2]:  I can't believe this! Why are all these things happening to me! I can't take it anymore! Let me out of the car! [Person1]:  Veronica, wait!
[Person1]:  Do you take reservations? [Person2]:  Of course. Reservations aren't necessary, but we recommend them as our restaurant can get quite busy. [Person1]:  I need a table for two for tonight. [Person2]:  What time? [Person1]:  We'd like to be seated at 8p m. [Person2]:  Smoking or non? [Person1]:  Non-smoking. [Person2]:  What name is the reservation under? [Person1]:  My name is Paul. [Person2]:  Ok. Please arrive at seven forty-five. We can only hold the table until 8, 15.
[Person1]:  Hello? [Person2]:  Hello, is that Miss Smith? [Person1]:  Yes. [Person2]:  This is Mr. Gao. How are you? [Person1]:  Not too bad, thanks. And you? [Person2]:  Fine. Listen. Are you free on Wednesday night? I'd like to invite you to dinner. [Person1]:  I'm terribly sorry, but I've already made arrangements for Wednesday. [Person2]:  That's a pity. How about Thursday? [Person1]:  That would be fine. [Person2]:  Great. What time would you like to meet? [Person1]:  Whenever is suitable for you. I have no plans for that day. [Person2]:  OK, let's say 6 o'clock at night. [Person1]:  And where would you like to meet? [Person2]:  I can pick you up at the gate of your company. Also, what type of food do you like? [Person1]:  I'm not very familiar with Chinese cuisine. What can you recommend? [Person2]:  Well, have you heard of Peking Duck? it's a local specialty. [Person1]:  Of course! Peking Duck is world-famous. I would love to try it. [Person2]:  OK, let's have that then. [Person1]:  All right. Well, I'll see you later. [Person2]:  See you later, goodbye.
[Person1]:  how was school today, Dominic? [Person2]:  I hate school! [Person1]:  why? What happened? [Person2]:  I messed up my mid-term exam so badly today! [Person1]:  it's just one exam. Can you re-take the exam? [Person2]:  yes, but it's so humiliating! I don't want my friends to know I failed! [Person1]:  why didn't you do a good job? [Person2]:  I don't know. I sat down in my seat, looked at my paper, and then my mind just went totally blank. [Person1]:  do you think you studied enough for the exam? [Person2]:  no. . . [Person1]:  what did you do last night? [Person2]:  I watched TV. [Person1]:  did you study at all last night for your exam? [Person2]:  no, not really. [Person1]:  I am sure if you had studied, you would have done well. When can you re-take your exam? [Person2]:  tomorrow. [Person1]:  alright. Get out your books and I'll help you prepare.
[Person1]:  Excuse me. [Person2]:  Yeah. [Person1]:  You didn't see someone pick up a blue sports bag, did you? [Person2]:  Sorry? [Person1]:  Yeah, a Big Blue nylon sports bag with a big white Adidas logo on the side. [Person2]:  I said no. [Person1]:  I only put it down for a moment when I went into the restroom, then I came out and... [Person2]:  I can't help you. [Person1]:  I don't believe it. I had a brand new racket in there and 10 new balls and er... [Person2]:  Well, these are public courts Madam, anyone can walk in here, you should be more careful.
[Person1]:  Do you like shopping at flea markets?  [Person2]:  l love it. There is always something fascinating to discover.  [Person1]:  The antiques market here in Paris is very famous. It's called Le marche aux puces de Saint-Ouen.  [Person2]:  That's not very easy to say.  [Person1]:  It's also known as Les Puces, which means 'The Fleas'.  [Person2]:  Can you find many bargains there?  [Person1]:  Well, it really depends. Because you are a tourist, it might be harder for you to get really good prices. 
[Person1]:  The boss had an informal discussion with me this morning, I feel really down.  [Person2]:  What's up? ?  [Person1]:  Well, actually I failed to meet a deadline last week and I forgot to answer an e-mail for a VIP customer yesterday.  [Person2]:  Anything that distracts you from work?  [Person1]:  Yes, everything. I feel overwhelmed by the daily work. Sometimes, I just can't focus on what I am doing. What is worse, though I make plans for a whole week, I always have to make changes later on because other things come up. I can't manage my time well. I can't handle work well. I am afraid I was screw up more things.  [Person2]:  Look, Lucy. Things are not so bad as you said. This is our company's busiest time in a year. You need to relax a little. Don't push yourself too hard, ok?  [Person1]:  Well, I will try. 
[Person1]:  what do you think about this store? I heard it's a posh store that's only got branches in big cities.  [Person2]:  I love this store. The only problem is that it's extremely expensive.  [Person1]:  don't worry. I've decided that for your birthday I'm going to take you shopping for a new dress.  [Person2]:  really? I thought you hated shopping?  [Person1]:  I do, that's why you should appreciate this gift!  [Person2]:  sure. That's really nice of you. Let's go in and try some things on. [Person1]:  how about this red dress? I think it would really suit you.  [Person2]:  that's gorgeous! Do they have it in a size 8?  [Person1]:  here you go. On any other day, it would cost me a fortune, but it's on special offer today.  [Person2]:  I think this color isn't quite right for me. Do they have the same dress in white?  [Person1]:  let me look. Let's see ... they've got one in blue, green, pink, black... and white. Here you are.  [Person2]:  this is perfect! What do you think?  [Person1]:  I think you look fantastic. Happy Birthday!  [Person2]:  I'm so lucky. You only get a chance like this once in a blue moon! Thanks honey! 
[Person1]:  Next, please. [Person2]:  Hi, I bought this DVD player here last Saturday, but it's not working properly. [Person1]:  What's the matter with it? [Person2]:  Well, several things. First of all, the remote doesn't work. [Person1]:  Did you put batteries in it? [Person2]:  Yes, of course. But it still didn't work. I couldn't change any of the functions on the display. It also doesn't fast forward when I'm playing a DVD. [Person1]:  Well, I'm sure that it's just a problem with this one player. I've never seen this with any of the models made by this brand. Do you want any of exchange it or return it? [Person2]:  I'd like to return it. [Person1]:  OK. Do you have the receipt? [Person2]:  Yes, here it is.
[Person1]:  Did you listen to the weather report this morning? [Person2]:  Yes, I did. The report says that it will be cloudy in the afternoon. I hope that it won't rain. [Person1]:  Have you made the sandwiches yet? [Person2]:  No, I haven't. I'll start right away. Did you get the soft drinks? [Person1]:  Yes, I did. They are in the refrigerator. [Person2]:  Would you put plastic knives and forks in the picnic basket? And don't forget the paper plates, and napkins. [Person1]:  Oh, Nancy called a while ago, she told me that she would like to bring something for the picnic. [Person2]:  I'll call her right away and ask her to bring a bottle of wine.
[Person1]:  Hey, what are you doing? [Person2]:  I am reading a tourism Journal. [Person1]:  I like New York very much. Is there anymore information? [Person2]:  No. But remember the Valentine's Day is coming nearer. [Person1]:  Could you recommend me some interesting places? [Person2]:  How about Las Vegas? There are fireworks, sound and light shows. [Person1]:  I don't like such noisy city. [Person2]:  Maybe you are right. [Person1]:  Have you finished reading the magazine? [Person2]:  Here you are. Maybe you can find what you need in it.
[Person1]:  Where shall we park our car? [Person2]:  Oh, park near the sports stadium. There are always a spaces around there. [Person1]:  And I want to go to the camera shop, so the sports stadium isn't very convenient for me. Is it possible to park along the street? [Person2]:  No way, we'll get a ticket. I'll drive through the camera shop and you can get off. I'll walk back to the camera shop after I've parked the car. [Person1]:  Ok, I'll see you there. Then we can go to the market together.
[Person1]:  Well, how was your honeymoon? [Person2]:  It was fantastic! We had such a good time. The only problem was that because it was their high season, we spent hours queuing. [Person1]:  Peak periods always involve hours of queuing. At least you got a nice tan though. [Person2]:  Yes, Florida had great weather while we were there. You looked tanned too! Did you go somewhere? [Person1]:  My friends and I just got back from Bali. [Person2]:  Wow! Bali has some of the best beaches in the world, doesn't it? [Person1]:  Yes, we were lucky. My friends father owns a resort on one of the islands. So we were able to stay for free. [Person2]:  Did you go diving while you were there? [Person1]:  I took a few diving classes before. But I didn't really like it. So I played table tennis instead. [Person2]:  Did you take any pictures in the ocean? [Person1]:  I've got quite a few pictures of all different kinds of fish. I'll show them to you next time I see you.
[Person1]:  Can you fix the time for the next meeting, Alex? How about June twelfth that's after the trade exhibition? [Person2]:  I thought something was happening on that day, Rebecca. [Person1]:  Oh, yes. You're right. The people from head office are coming. [Person2]:  What time does the airplane arrive? Can we have the meeting in the morning? [Person1]:  No, it's all arranged. I'm meeting them at 10 [Person2]:  Well, let's have the meeting earlier in June then. The trade exhibition finishes on the third, doesn't it? [Person1]:  Yes, but we need John's sales report for the meeting. How is it going? [Person2]:  I'm afraid John hasn't started yet. The figures won't be in place till next week. [Person1]:  Will it be ready early in June? [Person2]:  Well, not really. He told me that he will finish them by June tenth. [Person1]:  So we're looking at the week starting the seventeenth. How about 2 o'clock on that day? [Person2]:  I think that's OK. Let's meet here again then.
[Person1]:  Hello? [Person2]:  Hey Tina. What are you doing? [Person1]:  I was just watching TV. What's going on with you? [Person2]:  I just watched a movie and I'm scared. [Person1]:  What did you watch? [Person2]:  I saw the Sixth Sense. I didn't know it was going to be so scary. [Person1]:  I remember that. It was a great movie. But it was definitely scary. [Person2]:  If you're not busy, do you want to come over? I'm afraid to be alone. [Person1]:  Sure. I can come over. What should we do? [Person2]:  How about if we watch a comedy. I need something to get my mind off the frightening images I have from the Sixth Sense. [Person1]:  Ok. I'll get ready and leave. I'll see you in about 20 minutes. [Person2]:  Hurry, ok. It's dark out. [Person1]:  Don't worry, nothings going to happen. I'll be there real soon. [Person2]:  Ok. See you soon.
[Person1]:  This is the house I want to rent. [Person2]:  Could you tell me the advantages of it? [Person1]:  No problem. First, it's comfortable and cozy. Second, it has a lovely view of the city. Third, it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need, such as refrigerator, electric stove, heating apparatus, washing machine and dishwasher. Forth is the most important, the electricity is free of charge. Finally, it's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient. [Person2]:  There is something in what you said, but what is the rent? [Person1]:  200 dollars per week. [Person2]:  In my opinion, the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas. [Person1]:  It certainly is. But to tell you the truth, the room is so large that I can share it with someone else, and that will decrease the total amount of the rent. [Person2]:  Your intention is good, but I still can't agree with you. If no one would like to share it with you, you have to pay it all by yourself. [Person1]:  Don't you think I can save some bus fares since it's easy to go anywhere from here and it's near the place where I work? [Person2]:  I agree with you in this way. But how often do you go to work or shopping per week? [Person1]:  Twice a week for work and once for shopping. [Person2]:  In my opinion, you have to go to the university every day, and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university. [Person1]:  That's true. Ok, I will think about it.
[Person1]:  Mary, how was your date with john? [Person2]:  It's OK. It seems we have a lot in common. [Person1]:  Oh, really? That is great news. What does he look like? [Person2]:  He is tall and slim, fair-haired. [Person1]:  Sounds like he is pretty cute. What do you think of him? [Person2]:  He is a nice guy and very considerate. I am impressed with how smart he is and he has a great sense of humor. [Person1]:  Oh, it's love at first sight. When will you see each other again? [Person2]:  He didn't say, but he said he would call me. [Person1]:  Maybe he is busy with his work. Just wait and try not to think about it too much! [Person2]:  Oh, David. Stop it! I am a bit nervous! What should I do if he doesn't call me? [Person1]:  Come on, Mary, you're a total catch. I bet he will call you. Don't worry. [Person2]:  Thank you, David. You're always so encouraging. [Person1]:  That's what friends are for.
[Person1]:  Matthew, do you know much about body language in countries around the world? [Person2]:  Sure, I've picked up a few things from travelling around for work. Why? [Person1]:  Well, I had a meeting today with a woman from Japan and she wouldn't stop bowing! I didn't know what to do! [Person2]:  Did you bow back? [Person1]:  No, I tried to shake her hand, but her hand was so limp I was a bit offended. [Person2]:  Well, Japanese businessmen and women typically bow to greet each other in Japan. She might have been offended by your strong handshake. [Person1]:  But she was in America! Shouldn't she have known that strong handshakes in America signify confidence and respect? [Person2]:  Things are different in Japan. You know, in some countries, making eye contact with others is considered rude. [Person1]:  Is that why she wouldn't look at me in the meeting? [Person2]:  I think it's highly possible, yes. [Person1]:  The meeting really didn't go down well at all. I think I need to read up about intercultural communication before I have another meeting with someone from another country. [Person2]:  That's a good idea. When you don't know much about other cultures, the simplest thing can offend someone. [Person1]:  That's so true. It's great that we see eye to eye on this.
[Person1]:  Whoa. Now I'm awake! Zina has a secret admirer. [Person2]:  I really do not have time to deal with some lovesick computer geek. [Person1]:  I know what you mean. I can't stand computer geeks. [Person2]:  Sorry, Dave, I didn't mean you. I am just not in the mood for this. I have work to do. [Person1]:  Who do you think it is?
[Person1]:  Why do you want to go to the U. S. ? [Person2]:  I want to enrich my knowledge in management. The United States is an ideal place for me. [Person1]:  What will you do when you come home? [Person2]:  Before I work in the office, I was a teacher. So if possible, I'd like to come back to some school to pass on my new knowledge to more people. [Person1]:  Do you feel your English is good enough for the course? [Person2]:  Yes. You know, English is my present working language. Besides, I scored very high in TOEFL. [Person1]:  Who will be your supporter during your stay in the States? [Person2]:  I will support myself. In recent years, I have saved enough money for my study in the U. S. [Person1]:  How long do you expect to stay there? [Person2]:  I will be there for three years.
[Person1]:  I can't believe my English teacher is making me read pride and prejudice! [Person2]:  Why not! It's a classic. In fact, it's one of my favorite novels. [Person1]:  But it's so old. [Person2]:  Don't judge a book by its cover. Do you Kwon what it's about? [Person1]:  No, not at all. [Person2]:  First of all, it's a romance novel, set in the early 19th century. [Person1]:  I didn't realize it was a romance novel. What's the main storyline? [Person2]:  It's basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls. [Person1]:  Why does he want to do that? [Person2]:  Since he doesn't have a son, he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man. That way, all of his daughters will be cared for. [Person1]:  Won't they get his inheritance? [Person2]:  No, that's the problem. Though they are well-off, once he dies, his house will go to his cousin. So, when he dies, the girls will have nothing. [Person1]:  I see. This sounds interesting! Maybe my teacher isn't so horrible after all. [Person2]:  So, are you going to read the novel or watch the movie? [Person1]:  There's movie? My teacher didn't tell me that! [Person2]:  That's probably because she wants you to read the book first. [Person1]:  It would take a lot less time. . . [Person2]:  How about this. When you finish the book. I'll get the movie and watch it with you. [Person1]:  Ok. That sounds like a deal.
[Person1]:  Can you play tennis? [Person2]:  Yes, I can. [Person1]:  It is interesting, isn't it? [Person2]:  Yes, it's very interesting. [Person1]:  Can you teach me? [Person2]:  Sure. Take the tennis racket. Now, throw the ball up, and hit it with the racket. Like this. [Person1]:  Let me try. Oh, I missed! [Person2]:  Throw the ball up high. [Person1]:  High? [Person2]:  Yes, very high. Over your head. Then you will have time to hit the ball. [Person1]:  Oh! I hit it. [Person2]:  Well done! [Person1]:  Thank you. I think I like playing it.
[Person1]:  I would appreciate it if you could go to the store for me. [Person2]:  No problem. What do you want me to get? [Person1]:  Here's a list with a few things that I need you to get. [Person2]:  Did you forget to put anything on the list? [Person1]:  I don't think I forgot anything. [Person2]:  Would you like me to go anywhere else for you? [Person1]:  If you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you would pick up my prescription. [Person2]:  Has your prescription been filled yet? [Person1]:  Someone at the pharmacy called and told me it was ready. [Person2]:  Sure, I'll go get it for you. [Person1]:  Thank you. [Person2]:  Anything for you.
[Person1]:  Can I help you, sir? [Person2]:  Yes. Fill it up, please. [Person1]:  OK. What kind of gas do you want? [Person2]:  I don't really know. I have just bought this new car. And it's the first time I've gotten gas for it. [Person1]:  We have regular, super, and premium gasoline. This is a new car, so I'd recommend premium. [Person2]:  Premium, please. Thanks. Please fill it up. [Person1]:  All right, sir. You will park at refueling 4. [Person2]:  OK, thanks. [Person1]:  Your car's ready. [Person2]:  Good. How much does it come to? [Person1]:  Ten gallons of premium. That's $ 18. 56, please. [Person2]:  OK. Here you are. [Person1]:  Thank you, sir. Have a nice drive!
[Person1]:  Well, Peter, you have to do better than that next time, won ' t you? [Person2]:  Have I really got to do those exams again, Dad? [Person1]:  Of course, you have. You must try harder this time. [Person2]:  And must I go back to school? [Person1]:  No, you needn ' t do that. You ' d better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes. [Person2]:  But Dad, I should be working full-time at my age. I ' m nearly 17. [Person1]:  You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn ' t have failed your exams. You have to take a job and study. [Person2]:  What else I ' Ve got to do? Join the army? [Person1]:  Who knows! That might come to later.
[Person1]:  Tom is very excited! Just yesterday he received his doctoral degree and in a few minutes he'll be putting the ring on Sarah's finger. [Person2]:  He's really such a luck dog! Sarah is a lovely bride and tonight they are going to Hawaii on their honeymoon!
[Person1]:  Tiffany, why are more and more people turning to the Web to find a mate?  [Person2]:  I think that, as more people use the Internet for both work and pleasure, it makes more sense as a tool to connect with people, and the stigma of meeting someone online is reduced.  [Person1]:  There are actually special sites for people looking to date within their specific ethinc group and age group. But how should you screen potential mates? Do you suggest talking to them on the phone right away or communicating via e-mail?  [Person2]:  I would say do not make the e-mail exchange too long. A lot of times a connection via e-mail creates almost a false sense of intimacy. Quickly make sure there is a connection in the physical world.  [Person1]:  Can you give us any other safety tips for people pursuing relationships on the Net?  [Person2]:  I'd suggest you not give out too much personal information,like your home address,until after several dates. Just keep up the same guards you would keep up if you were meeting any stranger.  [Person1]:  Besides the growth of these matchmaker sites,do you have any stats on success rates? Are people out there finding true and lasting love through the Internet  [Person2]:  Well,for a site like ecrush. com,since their debut in Valentine's Day in 1999,of the 1. 5 million people who have joined ecrush. com, 300000 have actually matched.  [Person1]:  Do you have any successful stories to share?  [Person2]:  Yes, the couple that I highlighted at today's show met on Match. com and they're getting married this summer. 
[Person1]:  Hey Mike. What are you doing?  [Person2]:  Nothing much. What are you up to?  [Person1]:  I was just concerned about Sam. He hasn't been himself lately.  [Person2]:  He took the civil service exam and failed.  [Person1]:  That sucks. He must feel depressed.  [Person2]:  Yeah. He's been sitting in his room everyday for the last 4 days.  [Person1]:  Why don't we take him out? We can try to take his mind off of it. In the least show him that we're there for him.  [Person2]:  That's a great idea. Why don't you call him. I already talked to him a couple of times and it might be good for him to hear from somebody else.  [Person1]:  Ok. I'll call you back after I'm done.  [Person2]:  Sounds good. 
[Person1]:  It's hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy's headed... The trade deficit is getting larger, consumption's down, I really think we're headed for a recession.  [Person2]:  The economy has been stagnant for a while now. We've been in a recessive state for several months already. What worries me the most is the trade deficit. I think the government should do more to encourage exports.  [Person1]:  Increasing exports would weaken the curency. I think the main point is economic growth. We need more jobs. Factories have oursourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries. The result is an increase in unemployment in our own country, lower consumption, lower production, and an overall feeble economy. If more people are working, it will give the economy a boost.  [Person2]:  It's true that we should do something about unemployment, but what about inflation? If unemployment falls, there's pressure to increase pay. That would result in inflation, which would result in a much less dynamic economy. 
[Person1]:  I really admire you, Diana.  [Person2]:  Why, Jerry? Your words just came out of the blue.  [Person1]:  You are always happy and able to achieve high scores at school.  [Person2]:  I work very hard and that's it, you know, practice makes perfect.  [Person1]:  Isn't there anything else?  [Person2]:  I have no idea.  [Person1]:  You must have a high IQ score.  [Person2]:  Well, Jerry, let me tell you a secret.  [Person1]:  Go ahead.  [Person2]:  My IQ score is slightly above average.  [Person1]:  Seriously? But you are such a genius.  [Person2]:  Maybe I've got a higher EQ. I'm not sure.  [Person1]:  Well, perhaps you're right. Sometimes EQ matters more than IQ.  [Person2]:  You can say that again, Jerry. And I'm sure you're high in both of them. With a little more time cracking the books, you can also get high marks.  [Person1]:  OK, thank you. I'm going to the library, are you coming?  [Person2]:  Let's go! 
[Person1]:  I want to buy a black suit.  [Person2]:  Certainty. Do you want double breasted suit or single breasted suit?  [Person1]:  I prefer single breasted suit.  [Person2]:  What about this one? It's a very nice 3-piece suit.  [Person1]:  That looks great. Do you have ties here? 
[Person1]:  Can I help you, sir? [Person2]:  I'm looking for some winter clothes for my wife. [Person1]:  This is a good time to purchase clothes in our shop. We are having a preseason sale on all our winter clothes. Everything for winter is 20% off. [Person2]:  I think my wife may favor the sweater in the shop window. Do you have any skirts that go with this sweater? [Person1]:  Sure, look at this section. [Person2]:  I especially like this flowery skirt. My wife will look elegant in it. [Person1]:  You have good taste. It is very popular this year. [Person2]:  I don't think the green one suits the sweater, though. Do you have any skirts in light colors? [Person1]:  Look at the shelf on your right. [Person2]:  Oh yes. I'll take the white one. How much is it? [Person1]:  That will be $240 after the discount.
[Person1]:  Hey, May, look, Is that the the poster of the movie we saw yesterday? [Person2]:  Yes, that's right. That's the poster of the The Witch. [Person1]:  May, I really regret watching it with you last night. [Person2]:  Did it scare you? [Person1]:  Of course not. I just thought the movie was... boring. [Person2]:  Boring? Come on, you clutched to my arm all the time. [Person1]:  Well, I admit. The ghosts were scary. [Person2]:  I like scary movies. [Person1]:  That's Gucci's influence. I love science fiction movies! [Person2]:  Of course you do. They are silly stories just for little kids like you. [Person1]:  Don't call me kid. I am a grownup. [Person2]:  Do you dare watch scary movies with me tonight? [Person1]:  Of course! I can watch them without you! [Person2]:  Oh, really?
[Person1]:  I still have a question to ask you. [Person2]:  It's my pleasure! [Person1]:  How much luggage can I take for my flight? [Person2]:  It is allowed to carry 55 pounds for each passenger. [Person1]:  But if I have more than 55 pounds, what can I do? [Person2]:  You will have to pay some for every extra pound. [Person1]:  How about my hand carry luggage? [Person2]:  You can bring one, if you want to.
[Person1]:  Could you please reserve a taxi for me? [Person2]:  Do you think a private vehicle might be more to your liking? [Person1]:  A private vehicle? No, thanks, I won't need one. [Person2]:  Even better than a private vehicle is a limo. How does that sound? [Person1]:  T A X I, please. [Person2]:  A taxi it is. Where will you be headed? [Person1]:  Rockefeller Center. Can you get the taxi here immediately, please? [Person2]:  A taxi will be here in just a minute, sir. [Person1]:  Good. I'll get my coat and come downstairs. [Person2]:  The taxi will be ready when you are, sir.
[Person1]:  Which church do you attend? [Person2]:  I am Mormon, so I go to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. [Person1]:  What's the difference between this and other Churches? [Person2]:  Mormons believe that, after the death of Christ and the death of the Apostles 10, their church Christ founded became corrupt and the authority of Christ on earth was lost to men. In 1830, a prophet named Joseph Smith was brought up by God to restore the church. [Person1]:  Then does that mean the other churches are corrupt? [Person2]:  That means that they all have parts of the original gospel, but not all. [Person1]:  Do you believe that Mormons have all of it? [Person2]:  Yes. [Person1]:  Why do you really go to church? [Person2]:  We gather together to encourage each other, because we have common beliefs. We come together and call it church.
[Person1]:  Would you like something to eat? [Person2]:  Thank you. No. I'm late for dinner at my house. I really have to go. [Person1]:  Would you like to call home? [Person2]:  I'd appreciate that. [Person1]:  Please use the phone. [Person2]:  Thanks.
[Person1]:  This is today's schedule. At eight thirty, conference with the department managers. At 9 o'clock, live for the workshop where you'll award prizes to the stafffor preventatives. [Person2]:  That's great. What are the prizes? [Person1]:  3000 RMB as bonus for each person. [Person2]:  To encourage the staff increases. [Person1]:  Ok. Next thing is laying the corner-stone for the new plant at 10 AM. At 12 AM, back here for lunch. [Person2]:  What about the afternoon? [Person1]:  At 2 PM, give a presentation here with the press. At four o'clock sharp, have dinner with Mr. Smith, manager of NCC.
[Person1]:  OK. Here's the final drawing! It's for the trip! [Person2]:  And the winner is. . . Vivian, again! I don't believe it! [Person1]:  Our red underwear didn't do any good at all! [Person2]:  Well, there are still some consolation prizes. We can go up to the front and pick them up. [Person1]:  So, what did you win? [Person2]:  A lousy desk lamp. And you? [Person1]:  A bar of soap! [Person2]:  Look at Vivian! She thinks she's the cat's meow! [Person1]:  Why don't you go talk to her and find out what her secret was this year.
[Person1]:  Hi, I'm back! Hmm. . . your hair is pretty damaged, and you've got split ends. [Person2]:  Really? What can I do? [Person1]:  Well, the trim should fix the split ends, but you might need a deep conditioning treatment. [Person2]:  Umm, OK. Whatever you think will help. [Person1]:  I'm also going to add some layers to frame your face. [Person2]:  Can you use the thinning shears on top, too? My hair is really thick. [Person1]:  No problem! [Person2]:  Hi, I'm back! Hmm. . . your hair is pretty damaged, and you've got split ends. [Person1]:  Really? What can I do? [Person2]:  Well, the trim should fix the split ends, but you might need a deep conditioning treatment. [Person1]:  Umm, OK. Whatever you think will help. [Person2]:  I'm also going to add some layers to frame your face. [Person1]:  Can you use the thinning shears on top, too? My hair is really thick. [Person2]:  No problem!
[Person1]:  Excuse me. I'm wondering if you could tell me how to find a place where I could have my shoes fixed. I'm new in this city. [Person2]:  Of course. You can always look in the yellow pages and the back of the telephone book under shoe repair. [Person1]:  The yellow pages and the back of the telephone book under shoe repair. But I haven't got one right now. [Person2]:  There's a good shoe repair shop not far from here. Go down the street and turn left at the fourth crossing. It's next to the bank. [Person1]:  Well, do you know its name? [Person2]:  I'm sorry. I can't remember the name of the shop. It's near the police station. You can't miss it. [Person1]:  By the way, when will it be closed in the afternoon? [Person2]:  Half past five. Time is enough for you to get there.
[Person1]:  When do you usually go to the bank, John? [Person2]:  Anytime I have to. Why did you ask? [Person1]:  You'd better avoid Friday mornings. I'm reading an interesting book these days. And it says most robberies happen on Friday mornings.
[Person1]:  Oh. Hi there. A beauty, isn't she? [Person2]:  Well ... [Person1]:  Do you want to take her a test ride? [Person2]:  Well ... Um. How old is it? [Person1]:  Well, it's only three years old? [Person2]:  And what's the mileage? [Person1]:  Uh, let me check. Oh yes. 75,000 miles. [Person2]:  75,000 miles? That's quite a bit for a car that's only three years old. [Person1]:  Well, once you're in the driver's seat, you'll fall in love with her. Get in. [Person2]:  Ugh ... Uh, I can't seem to get the door open. [Ah, it's okay.] It could be broken. [Person1]:  Ah, just give her a little tap. Ugh. Now she's opened. [Person2]:  Great. A door I have to beat up to open. [Person1]:  Hey. Get in and start her up. [Woman tries to start the car ...] [Um] Well, it's probably the battery. I know she has enough gas in her, and I had our mechanic check her out just yesterday. Try it again. [Person2]:  Uh. It sounds a little rough to me. [Well ...] How much is this minivan anyway? [Person1]:  Oh. It's a real bargain today and tomorrow only at $15,775, plus you get the extended warranty covering defects, wear, and tear beyond the normal maintenance on the vehicle for an extra $500 for the next 30,000 miles. [Oh ...] with a few minor exclusions. [Person2]:  Like ...? [Person1]:  Well, I mean, it covers everything except for the battery, and light bulbs, and brake drums, exhaust system, trim and moldings, upholstery and carpet, paint, tires ... Well, a short list, you know. [Person2]:  Uh. Well, almost $16,000 is a little out of my price range, plus the seats covers are torn a little. [Person1]:  Well, hey, I might be able to talk the manager into lowering the price another two hundred dollars, but that's about all. [Person2]:  No thanks. I think I'll just keep looking.
[Person1]:  Dave, wake up.  [Person2]:  Whaah? Zina? What time is it?  [Person1]:  It's seven-thirty. I want to know who left this note on my desk.  [Person2]:  What note? I can't see. I just pulled an all-nighter.  [Person1]:  It's a little green post-it note, stuck right in the middle of my computer screen.  [Person2]:  And? What does it say? Isn't there a name?  [Person1]:  It says, Zina, I like how you rhumba. An admirer. 
[Person1]:  Excuse me, madam. Is this seat taken?  [Person2]:  No.  [Person1]:  Do you mind my sharing the same table with you?  [Person2]:  Of course not. There are so many people here today.  [Person1]:  Yes. I can't even find a seat. 
[Person1]:  I see you've brought something to occupy your time while we wait. Good. We may be here for a long time. [Person2]:  Yes, Papa. I brought the catalog for the next college we're going to visit -- the one in New Hampshir. [Person1]:  Maybe we won't have to wait long. We've only been here fifteen minutes. I heard that the people here usually arrive around thirty minutes later than the time they set. [Person2]:  I'm not used to the way they treat time here. They wouldn't see me if we were in China. I missed the appointment because I was forty-five minutes late at Shanghai. I think if I was in the states, they might probably arrive latter than me. [Person1]:  It's just that Chinese people pay more attention to exact times. They're very punctual people. But the american may be more casual. [Person2]:  I think that if you're more than thirty minutes late, you have to apologize and explain what delayed you. [Person1]:  Our appointment with this dean is for three-fifteen. My watch says three-thirty. I'm sure we're not late.  [Person3]:  Lily? Come in. Sorry I kept you waiting. I did not expect that you would arrive such early!
[Person1]:  Excuse me. How much is the chocolate bar?  [Person2]:  One dollar.  [Person1]:  So, I can have five for five dollars?  [Person2]:  Actually, you can only have four.  [Person1]:  Oh, yeah. I forgot tax. Give me four then, please.  [Person2]:  Okay. Thanks. 
[Person1]:  What happened to your eye? [Person2]:  Nothing really, I went to kiss my daughter on the cheek last night, and she reached up to stop me. One of her fingernails scraped my eye. [Person1]:  That sounds painful, it wasn't too bad at first, but the next morning. It really hurt. [Person2]:  You'd better see a doctor. There might be a scar. [Person1]:  I'd planned to see a doctor this morning, but was asked to meet an important client by my manager. [Person2]:  Oh, you're always so busy.
[Person1]:  Hello Roger this is Anne. [Person2]:  Oh, hi Anne, how have you been? And how's your new apartment? [Person1]:  Well, that's what I'm calling about, you see, I've decided to look for a new place. [Person2]:  Oh, what's the problem with your place now? I thought you liked the apartment. [Person1]:  Oh, I do, but it's too far from the school, can you help me? [Person2]:  All right. So what kind of place are you looking for? [Person1]:  Well, I'd like to share an apartment with one or two roommates, and I can walk to school. [Person2]:  Ok, how much do you want to spend on rent? [Person1]:  Ah, about $150 a month? Oh, I'd prefer to rent a furnished apartment. [Person2]:  Well, I know there is an apartment. I'll drop by there on my way to class tomorrow. [Person1]:  Hey, thanks a lot. [Person2]:  Not at all.
[Person1]:  I need to go to the ATM. [Person2]:  So, why don ' t you? [Person1]:  I have no idea how to use the ATM. [Person2]:  What do you mean? [Person1]:  This will be my first time using an ATM. [Person2]:  I can help you with that. [Person1]:  Explain to me how to use it. [Person2]:  Just put your card into the machine. [Person1]:  Now what do I do? [Person2]:  Then you need to type in your PIN. [Person1]:  Now what? [Person2]:  Just click on one of the choices they give you, and that ' s it.
[Person1]:  This place is great. I'm surprised there are so many things here. [Person2]:  Yes, but it takes a while to find things. It's not organized as carefully as a regular store. [Person1]:  What's the difference between an outlet and a regular store? [Person2]:  Usually a clothes company will send their overstock to an outlet. The prices are very low. But you may find faulty products here too. [Person1]:  Faulty products? [Person2]:  Yes. Sometimes the fault is very small ; if you have a needle and thread, you can fix it yourself. So it's a good deal to buy it. [Person1]:  Oh, that's easy for me. I think it's really a good deal. [Person2]:  Yes. You can save a lot of money in this way. [Person1]:  That's great for me. Look, children's clothes! I'd like to buy some winter clothes for my son and daughter. [Person2]:  Why not buy the sweater? It only costs 30 Yuan. [Person1]:  Yes, I'll take it. Are there any jeans? Xiaohui's jeans are always dirty. I also need four pairs of slippers. [Person2]:  How many do you want to buy? [Person1]:  I ought to make the most of it while I'm here, don't you think? [Person2]:  You're right.
[Person1]:  How long will it take to learn English? Will I be able to take other courses next semester or will English take up all of my time? [Person2]:  It's hard to say. Language isn't like other studies. [Person1]:  You mean I could finish this course and still not know English? You'Ve got to be kidding! [Person2]:  I'm not kidding. Learning a language is a question of forming language habits and that takes time. [Person1]:  So do we have to stay in this English class forever? [Person2]:  No. You just have to stay here long enough to get some orientation. Then you go on practicing and learning outside. A lot of learning depends on your personal motivation. [Person1]:  So it's really the same story. Practice, practice, practice and more practice is the only way to learn a language. [Person2]:  You said it.
[Person1]:  I watched a very interesting documentary about plants yesterday evening. It was called ' unusual plants ' and looked at several species of plants from around the world which have unusual features. [Person2]:  Really? Tell me about some of the plants they showed. [Person1]:  Well. There was one type of plant that catches insects and eats them. [Person2]:  Is that type of plant found in this country? [Person1]:  No, it isn't. it's a pity, because I'd like to see it in action. [Person2]:  So would I. what other unusual plants did they show? [Person1]:  They showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee. The insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar. Other insects cannot get it. Of course, when the insect collects the nectar, it also takes some pollen from one flower to another. [Person2]:  That's very specialized. So, the insects and the flowers rely on each other. If one became extinct, the other would too. [Person1]:  That's right. That's one reason why it's so important to protect every species. [Person2]:  I see. The plants that fascinate me most are cacti. I find it amazing that they can survive in such dry desert conditions. [Person1]:  According to the documentary, they have an incredible ability to find water supplies, however small, and then store them without losing much through evaporation. [Person2]:  That's why they often have long roots to find water spines instead of leaves, to reduce water loss.
[Person1]:  Robert, this is my friend, Mrs. Smith. [Person2]:  Hi, Nice to meet you. [Person3]:  Nice to meet you too. [Person2]:  Mrs. Smith, what do you do for work? [Person3]:  I'm a doctor. [Person2]:  Oh. Where do you work? [Person3]:  New York University hospital in New York City. What do you do? [Person2]:  I'm a teacher. [Person3]:  What do you teach? [Person2]:  I teach English. [Person3]:  Where? [Person2]:  At a high school in New Jersey. [Person3]:  That's nice. How old are you? [Person2]:  I'm 32.
[Person1]:  Hi, Dave. You're early. [Person2]:  So you knew it was me? [Person1]:  I had an idea. [Person2]:  Look, before we get into the secret admirer thing, I want to talk to you about WebTracker. [Person1]:  I'm sorry. I know you feel betrayed. [Person2]:  So you're really planning to quit invoking and switch over to WebTracker? [Person1]:  My mind is made up.
[Person1]:  Has anyone told you about Jessica's party coming up? [Person2]:  I was told about it already. I'm just waiting for my invitation. [Person1]:  Is that right? I already got my invitation from her earlier. [Person2]:  I believe that she will give me the invitation today. [Person1]:  Are you even going to go? [Person2]:  Yeah, it sounds like it's going to be the best party of the year. [Person1]:  Exactly, it seems like it's going to be loads of fun. [Person2]:  When exactly does the party start? [Person1]:  The invitation says it starts at 8 [Person2]:  Has she given out a lot of invitations yet? [Person1]:  I have no idea, she hasn't given out many though. [Person2]:  I'm planning on going, but I really need her to give me my invitation.
[Person1]:  Hi, taxi.  [Person2]:  Good morning, Lady. Where do you wanna go?  [Person1]:  I want to go to this place.  [Person2]:  You want to go to No. 22 Xiangyun Dajie?  [Person1]:  Yes, yes, No. 22 Xiangyun Dajie. [Person2]:  I am sorry. I don't know where that is. I only know where Xiaoyun Road is, but I've never heard of Xiangyun Dajie.  [Person1]:  You don't know Xiangyun Dajie, do you?  [Person2]:  No, maybe you can ask some other taxi drivers. I am sorry. I can't help you.  [Person1]:  Not at all. Thank you all the same. 
[Person1]:  So, you friend's getting married on Saturday. What have you bought her as a wedding gift. I find is so hard to choose the right gift.  [Person2]:  My friend and her fiance had a really good idea. They have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook. The picture are of things they want. People sign their name by the item they will buy.  [Person1]:  That's clever! Then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there's no chance of two people buying the same gift. What things were in the notebook?  [Person2]:  Most of the things were household appliance. You know, everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker. I think it's an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home.  [Person1]:  So , what did you get them?  [Person2]:  I bought a sewing machine. I know that my friend likes making her own clothes, but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems.  [Person1]:  What's wrong with it?  [Person2]:  She says that after several years of use, it's not working properly. When she uses it, it makes a funny noise.  [Person1]:  Household appliance don't seem to last for a long time nowadays.  [Person2]:  I think it's because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models. Because they know that we will buy the new models, the appliances don't need to last more than five or ten years at most. 
[Person1]:  What are you going to do for the project? [Person2]:  I don't know. I was hoping you could help me think of something. [Person1]:  Well, you're such a good artist. You could talk about watercolor while you're doing one in front of the class. [Person2]:  Maybe, but what if I make a mistake in front of everyone? [Person1]:  Come on, you're really talented. Besides you wouldn't have to do much preparation before hand. [Person2]:  True. [Person1]:  Or how about this? You could bring in a photo, a pencil drawing and watercolor of the same subject. Something simple so it wouldn't take so much time to do like a flower. Then you could show the advantages and disadvantages of working with different materials. [Person2]:  I could do that ahead of time. [Person1]:  You could, but remember it would take a lot more time. [Person2]:  Sure. Thanks.
[Person1]:  So, eh, could you tell me something about the job? [Person2]:  Sure, it's working behind the box office, selling tickets to people that come in to buy a ticket to go and see a film. [Person1]:  Ok, and what are the hours I'd have to work? [Person2]:  Well, it's just from 4 [Person1]:  Ahha, so weekends are free then. [Person2]:  Yeah, weekends are free. [Person1]:  And how much is the salary? [Person2]:  It's 5 pounds an hour, so working from 4 [Person1]:  Ahha, alright. How do I apply? [Person2]:  Well, the best thing is if you come in and see me and we can fill out an application form while you're here. [Person1]:  Ok, and who do I ask for? [Person2]:  Uh, you ask for Steve Wallace. [Person1]:  Alright. Thank you then.
[Person1]:  What a beautiful necklace! [Person2]:  It was my grandmothers'. [Person1]:  She gave it to you as a birthday gift? [Person2]:  No, she gave it to me before she passed away. [Person1]:  I see. That's a beautiful vase. Is it from your grandmother, too? [Person2]:  No, it comes from China. My husband went to China on business last month and bought it for me.
[Person1]:  Hello, auntie. Is Andy in? I want to invite him over for the weekend. The great young singer Justin Bieber is giving a performance in the concert hall nearby. [Person2]:  Oh, thank you, Dirk. But I don't think Andy will be able to make it. [Person1]:  Why? Doesn't he like Justin Bieber? [Person2]:  He does like him. But there's something wrong with his stomach. He went to the doctors with your uncle for an examination today. He hasn't come back yet. [Person1]:  I'm sorry to hear that. I hope it is nothing serious. [Person2]:  I hope so, too. But he was in great pain this morning. I was really scared. [Person1]:  What do you think caused it? [Person2]:  I don't know for sure. Perhaps it has something to do with what he ate last night. He went to Mary's birthday party and ice cream was served there. [Person1]:  He likes ice cream? [Person2]:  You are right. He must have eaten too much.
[Person1]:  Hello! How do I get more amenities? [Person2]:  I'm sorry, sir. I'm not sure I understand. [Person1]:  I'm talking about the free stuff, like soap and shampoo. [Person2]:  Oh, I see. So, you're saying that you've already run out of your amenities. [Person1]:  No, no. I've got plenty left. [Person2]:  Now I'm confused again! What is the problem? [Person1]:  What am I going to do about souvenirs? [Person2]:  Oh, I get it! You want souvenirs! [Person1]:  Yes, I've got enough soap for my use, but no extra soap for souvenirs. [Person2]:  Sir, our souvenir shop carries all those items, and as a guest you get a discount. [Person1]:  Please! Free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs. [Person2]:  I understand completely, sir. Housekeeping will bring you souvenirs in just a moment.

I appreciate all help and in particular, all the time that you've spent on my account during my stay here. [Person2]:  Don't mention it. I am pleased to help you. [Person1]:  If there's anything that I can help you in the future, please let me know. [Person2]:  I'll do that. Thank you. Have a safe trip home.
[Person1]:  I believe you ordered the Grand Slam breakfast. [Person2]:  Oh, good! You know, I am looking at my plate and I ordered scrambled eggs, not fried. [Person1]:  Oh, I just noticed that I accidentally brought you your friend's breakfast. [Person2]:  I can just trade with him, thank you. [Person1]:  And pancakes for you, sir. [Person2]:  I am sorry, but I think I ordered waffles. [Person1]:  I am sorry that I misheard you. [Person2]:  Just please take my pancakes to trade for waffles.

[Person1]:  Good morning, can I help you? [Person2]:  We'd like to buy some furniture for our new house. [Person1]:  Here are several sets of furniture, including sofa, dressing table, wardrobe, and sideboard. How about this one? [Person2]:  We like a larger wardrobe.
[Person1]:  Kelly, the guys and I think you should run for senior class president. [Person2]:  Me? Why me? Why not you? [Person1]:  We talked to our older brothers and sisters last night and got the scoop on what that job is all about. [Person2]:  And you think I fit the qualifications? [Person1]:  Yes. Did you know that the senior class president works for the class for life? The job doesn't stop when we graduate. [Person2]:  Really? What is there to do after we graduate? [Person1]:  Every class reunion is organized by the president and council and anything our class does for the school in later years is headed by the president. [Person2]:  I'm honored that you think I would be qualified. But I would really have to think about this first.
[Person1]:  My minibar is completely empty. [Person2]:  Everything in that minibar has been consumed, sir? [Person1]:  Everything's gone. [Person2]:  Is there anything special you'd like? [Person1]:  Just bring me three bottles each of Jim Beam and Perrier. [Person2]:  Okay, sir. Three of each. Would you like anything else? [Person1]:  The fruit basket was great. I need a few more apples, please. [Person2]:  Perrier, Jim Beam, and apples. Is that it for now? [Person1]:  Yes, one last thing [Person2]:  Your order will be brought to you momentarily, sir.
[Person1]:  I really appreciate your filling me in on yesterday's lecture. [Person2]:  No problem. I thought you might want to go over it together. And, anyway, it helps me review, Hope you're feeling better now. [Person1]:  I am. Thanks. So, you said she talked about squid? Sounds a little strange. [Person2]:  Well, actually, it was about the evolution of sea life--a continuation from last week. The octopus and the squid descended from earlier creatures with shells. They survived by shedding their shells--somewhere between 200 and 500 million years ago. [Person1]:  That's a pretty long span of time. [Person2]:  I know. That's what she said, though. To be precise [Person1]:  Some squid are really huge. Can you imagine something that big if it still had a shell? [Person2]:  Actually, it's because they lost their shells that they could evolve to a bigger size. [Person1]:  Makes sense. But some are really huge. I've read about fishermen that caught squid that weighed over a ton. Did she talk about how that happens? [Person2]:  Not really. But she did mention some unusual cases. In 1933 in New Zealand they caught a squid.., let's see here.., it was twenty-two yards long. Its eyes were eighteen inches across. Can you imagine? [Person1]:  Reminds me of all those stories of sea monsters. [Person2]:  Dr. Simpson thinks there are probably even larger ones that haven't been found because squid are intelligent and fast---so they can easily get away from humans. Maybe some of those monster stories are true.
[Person1]:  Good morning, sir. Is there anything I can do for you?  [Person2]:  Yes, I would like to have a suit made to measure.  [Person1]:  Sure. How do you like your suit?  [Person2]:  I want a single breasted suit. Here is the cloth. 
[Person1]:  What courses are you going to take next year?  [Person2]:  Well, I am certainly going to take chemistry and physics, but I haven't decided on the other subjects yet. I'd like to take English.  [Person1]:  Why are you going to take english with chemistry and physics?  [Person2]:  Because I want to study english literature. but I think chemistry is better for getting a job.  [Person1]:  Of course it depends on what you are going to do when you leave college. Have you deside what you are going to do when you graduated?  [Person2]:  I am going to be a, well, I hope to be a reseach chemist. 
[Person1]:  Solomon Department Store. May I help you? [Person2]:  Yes, could you tell me when the store closes today? [Person1]:  We close at 7 [Person2]:  I see. And when do you open? [Person1]:  Ten o'clock on the weekend. [Person2]:  Fine. Thank you very much.
[Person1]:  Hi dear, I'm tired and don't want to cook. Shall we have dinner in a restaurant? [Person2]:  Oh, I forgot to tell you. Jane and Bill invited us to dinner this evening. I promised we'd go. [Person1]:  Good. You know, I love Jane's cooking. What's the time? [Person2]:  6 [Person1]:  That's nice. Shall we take them anything? [Person2]:  No Jane said she'd like to do all the food preparation herself. What about taking a bottle of wine? Bill loves wine. [Person1]:  I'd rather take some Flowers. I know Jane loves roses. [Person2]:  Good, I'll buy some on my way home.
[Person1]:  Tony, we should have a look at the schools before deciding where we move. Our daughter needs to have a good education. [Person2]:  Right. I've got some information about some schools in Brighton from the district office. [Person1]:  Good. It appears there are five high schools, three state schools and two private. [Person2]:  I don't know if we want private schools, do we? [Person1]:  No, it's too expensive for us. [Person2]:  I would like our child to go to a state school. [Person1]:  Ah, here. Our daughter isn't good at sports or music, but has a good sense of fashion. We could send her to a school with good vocational training, such as designing or modeling. [Person2]:  What about Brighton Art School? [Person1]:  Then, what are the schools like academically? I mean, how many children go on to University every year? [Person2]:  Well, Simon Grammar School is very good. About 80% of their students go onto University. And the art school is even better with a number of students reaching 90%. George High School isn't so good, only 38%. [Person1]:  Well, it seems Brighton Art School is a good choice.
[Person1]:  Didn ' t you punch in this morning, Monica? [Person2]:  Sorry, I don ' t know the rule about punching. [Person1]:  That ' s ok. I should have told you earlier. This is a company rule. [Person2]:  Do we also need to punch out after work? [Person1]:  According to the company rule, we should punch in before 8 o ' clock and punch out after 5 o ' clock every work day. [Person2]:  How about the lunch break, Lucy? [Person1]:  From 11 thirty to 1 o ' clock. [Person2]:  May I ask whether we need to work overtime? [Person1]:  Sometimes, but not quite often.
[Person1]:  Hello, again. Did you discuss everything with your colleagues? [Person2]:  Yes, yes. It seems that everything is settled. [Person1]:  Have you decided how you would like the salaries paid? [Person2]:  We have discussed it and decided that at the moment we would like the salaries to be paid into the employees's accounts, whether they are currently with this bank or not. [Person1]:  That's not a problem. [Person2]:  Of course, if we are happy with the service after the initial period we will recommend all employees either transfer their accounts to this bank, or open new accounts with you. [Person1]:  Thank you very much. We always welcome new customers.
[Person1]:  How do you arrange this summer vacation? [Person2]:  I want to travel. [Person1]:  Where would you like to go? [Person2]:  The seaside. [Person1]:  That's really a good idea. Taking a walk on the beach and lying in the sun are pretty good. I recommend you Qingdao or Dalian. [Person2]:  I ' Ve been to Qingdao before, so I ' ll choose Dalian. I've heard that the environment there is very good. [Person1]:  Yes, that's a good place to spend a holiday. Last year I went there. It's really. [Person2]:  Thank you!
[Person1]:  How long is the warranty? [Person2]:  We guarantee our product for two years. [Person1]:  How about the repairs after the warranty expire?

[Person1]:  Hey, what sort of drinks do you want? Gatorade or water? [Person2]:  Gatorade. It's rich in Vitamin and it gives us energy and vitality. [Person1]:  Yes, that's the exact thing we need. One for each. [Person2]:  What should we do, now with Jack out of the game? [Person1]:  We should choose from the backups. [Person2]:  That's right. Spraining the ankle and breaking the leg are the common things during the match. [Person1]:  That's why we should learn to protect ourselves. Otherwise, the game is not worth the candle. [Person2]:  That's for sure. During the back court, we should change the position we played. [Person1]:  Yes, I played shooting guard, I like shooting and you'll play inside, OK? [Person2]:  I agree with you. I think we'll play much better than before. [Person1]:  Wow, the cheer-section is coming. The music is so fantastic. [Person2]:  Yeah, look how passionate they are! Are they professional? [Person1]:  Well, you should ask your friend. You know I'm not the boss. Just kidding. [Person2]:  Oops! I almost forget about it. Do you see the girl in the middle of the first line? [Person1]:  Yeah, what's up? [Person2]:  Don't you think she looks like your daughter? [Person1]:  I also have a doubt. Oh, kill me softly, she is May.
[Person1]:  Well, you know what, don't do it, ' cause the minute you do, they lose all respect for you. [Person2]:  Well, it's not like that. We just e-mail, it's really nothing. On top of which I am definitely thinking about stopping because it's getting. . . [Person1]:  Out of hand. [Person2]:  Confusing. But not, because it's nothing. [Person1]:  Where'd you meet him? [Person2]:  Oh, listen, I can't even remember. Ok, on my birthday, I wandered into over 30 rooms, for a joke, sort of and he was there, and we started chatting. . . [Person1]:  About what? [Person2]:  Oh, books, and music, how much we both love New York. Harmless, harmless, meaningless. Bouquets of sharpened pencils. Oh. [Person1]:  Excuse me? [Person2]:  Forget it. We don't talk about anything personal, so I don't know his name or what he does or where he lives exactly. So it'll be really easy for me to stop seeing him, because I'm not. . .
[Person1]:  Hi, happy new year! [Person2]:  Hey, the same to you! [Person1]:  Time flies! One year has already been a history! [Person2]:  Definitely, it's time to say bye-bye to the last year and to say hello to the new year! [Person1]:  Yeah. Have you made any good resolutions for this new year? [Person2]:  Some resolutions? That's a wonderful idea, but I have no idea yet. How about you? [Person1]:  I want to be healthier this year, so I think I should take more exercise. [Person2]:  That will be a good one! Anything else? [Person1]:  Maybe I should make a plan about learning my biochemistry, which is a mess! [Person2]:  Sounds great!
[Person1]:  Excuse me, Professor, is there a time when I could meet with you? [Person2]:  I could meet with you tomorrow anywhere from two until four ; what time works out best? [Person1]:  I would like to come in at three o'clock. [Person2]:  I am glad that that works out ; can you find my office? [Person1]:  Yes, I can. [Person2]:  Just follow the walkway to the outside and climb the stairs to the third floor. [Person1]:  I got it. [Person2]:  If you do get lost, just ask someone in the building to point the way. [Person1]:  Thank you, I'll be there. [Person2]:  If you need to cancel your appointment, please give me a call!
[Person1]:  The police need our help finding a robber. [Person2]:  How do you know? [Person1]:  The TV news is reporting a bank robbery. [Person2]:  Do they know what the robber looks like? [Person1]:  Yes, he's 6 feet tall, 200 pounds, black hair, and about 30 years old. [Person2]:  What race is he? [Person1]:  They didn't say. [Person2]:  The TV news doesn't tell us the race anymore. [Person1]:  Of course not. That would be racist. [Person2]:  But how can we identify someone if we don't know their race? [Person1]:  Don't ask me. [Person2]:  Then they also shouldn't tell us if the robber is male or female, because that is sexist.
[Person1]:  Excuse me. My name is David Walker. Haven't we met before? [Person2]:  Well, let me see. . . Do you work at IBM Corporation? [Person1]:  Yes, I do. [Person2]:  Now I remember. We met at a conference in Tokyo last year.
[Person1]:  Did you call me? [Person2]:  Thank you for returning my call. [Person1]:  What was your call about? [Person2]:  I wanted to have a talk with you about your son. [Person1]:  What did he do? [Person2]:  He was messing around last week in class. [Person1]:  Exactly what did he do? [Person2]:  Even though I asked him not to, he kept speaking out in class. [Person1]:  I don't know what his problem is. [Person2]:  I need you to talk to him, if you don't mind. [Person1]:  That won't happen again, I'm sorry. [Person2]:  Thank you. Hopefully I won't have to call about him again.
[Person1]:  Hi Jane, can you let me know the best way to get to your house this evening?  [Person2]:  Certainly, where will you be coming from?  [Person1]:  I need to be in the city centre this afternoon so I will be coming straight from there.  [Person2]:  Ok. Take the Underground (the Circle line) to High Street Kensington. Make sure you take the High Street Kensington exit.  [Person1]:  Got that.  [Person2]:  Ok - when you leave the Underground, cross the road and you should see Hornton Street. WAk up that street to the crossroads. As you wAk you should see a fast food place on your right.  [Person1]:  Hold on, I am looking at the map now. Ok, I can see Hornton Road. Do I go straight at the intersection?  [Person2]:  No, you need to turn left into Philimore WAk and take the next right.  [Person1]:  Ok, I can see that road.  [Person2]:  That's fine. You will not miss it because it's just next to the Kensington CentrA Library.  [Person1]:  Good, I can see the library on the map.  [Person2]:  Ok, we live in the third building on your left. Will we see you around 7 pm?  [Person1]:  That's great, see you at seven.

[Person2]:  You means she didn't marry a rich man.  [Person1]:  He's a postman.  [Person2]:  I thought she would marry a fortune. 
[Person1]:  Hello Ralph, it's mom. [Person2]:  Oh, morning, mom! [Person1]:  Ah, it's 1 [Person2]:  Well, I'm going to make breakfast and check my email to see if anyone has responded to my advertisement for a new roommate. [Person1]:  Right? [Person2]:  What do you mean by 'right'? [Person1]:  Listen, who's willing to live with you? You cannot even take care of yourself. [Person2]:  What are you talking about? I get up early every morning at 6 o'clock AM? [Person1]:  Add about 6 hours to that. [Person2]:  I always make nutritious meals. [Person1]:  I don't think McDonald's big Macs and fries count. [Person2]:  I keep my room very tidy. [Person1]:  Ah, I think I saw some old dishes, empty pizza boxes and some real dirty socks under your bed. [Person2]:  And I do go to bed at a very early hour. [Person1]:  Do you call midnight early? Listen, give it up! Unless you make some major changes in your life, your only companion will be your pet fish.

[Person1]:  Oh dear I've got a toothache too, in the dentist says he simply can't see me until next week. But what worries me is my headache. [Person2]:  I know what you mean, but at least you can do some gardening. I can't even do that with my back. The doctor says I mustn't lift or bend. [Person1]:  You poor thing. There's nothing worse than back trouble, but I don't do much in the garden now because I've hurt my arm, it's really painful. [Person2]:  Like my ankle, it hurts.

[Person2]:  Well, what about this red one? [Person1]:  Ummm, it's okay. How much is it? I don't see a price tag. [Person2]:  Well, let's see. It usually sells for $34, but it's on sale for $16. [Person1]:  Hmm. Okay, I'll take it. Thanks.
[Person1]:  I need some new clothes for the new school year. Can you help me? [Person2]:  Of course. What do you like to wear?

[Person1]:  Exporters must ensure that their product satisfies customers ' needs, wants and likes. [Person2]:  Ah, some products are successful at home, but not be popular overseas. [Person1]:  That's because the fashion, taste and social customs and so on vary considerably. [Person2]:  Yes, sometimes the differences are great. [Person1]:  Well, we should be in accordance with national conditions and adjust the product. [Person2]:  We have to ensure that the product should be attractive to guarantee sales.

[Person1]:  I think it is very necessary for us. I wonder whether I am on holiday with payment every year. [Person2]:  Yes, you have a paid month holiday every year. [Person1]:  Right. How about the unemployment compensation and the retirement pension? [Person2]:  Well, we are only responsible for the retirement pension.

[Person1]:  Have you ever played Making? [Person2]:  Not really, but I know it is very popular a traditional Chinese gambling game. [Person1]:  Yes, some friends play it all day, all night, and sometimes a whole weekend. I tried to read about some basic rules online, but it is hard to understand. So I went to watch people play yesterday only to find I was even more confused. I think I have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing. Practice makes the master. [Person2]:  Typical Francis, whether you are at work, or engaged in leisure time activities, you always show the same eagerness and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself. [Person1]:  It is important to keep your mind up-to-date and active.
[Person1]:  Sally, I'm tired of this Western food. I really miss my mother's Sichuan cooking. [Person2]:  I'm sure you do miss that type of cooking. But can't you try to get used to Western food? [Person1]:  I have tried. But Americans like butter, bread, sugar, and cream too much. [Person2]:  I suppose you're right, Lee. Maybe that's why so many Westerners are overweight. [Person1]:  It's interesting that Americans work very hard at their jobs, do not take naps during the day, and yet they can be so heavy. [Person2]:  You see, because we are often busy working, we eat too much fast food, and that food is very fattening.
[Person1]:  Hey. Owen! Have you gone on your family vacation yet? [Person2]:  Oh, yes. I got so tired. My son began to cry the moment we got on the train. It was very embarrassing because we took the over-night train and the noise made it difficult for other people in the cabin to sleep. [Person1]:  Didn't you bring his favorite toy? [Person2]:  Yes, we did. Fortunately we put his Teddy Bear in the bag, and finally he fell asleep at mid-night with it in his arms. [Person1]:  Where did you go? You've got a beautiful tan. [Person2]:  My wife didn't like to go to amusement parks, so we compromised and finally went to the seaside. I think vacation in summer is not good. [Person1]:  You must have had a great time. Most children love to play in the sand on the beach and go swimming. [Person2]:  Yes, he was every excited to see the blue sea and picked up many seashells to give as gift for his classmates in kindergarten. [Person1]:  His friends will be very happy to get the little souvenir. [Person2]:  And I taught him how to swim in the sea. It was fun and made him braver than before. After we returned home, he wasn't afraid to sleep alone in his bedroom.
[Person1]:  You seem to be very hesitant about doing things. [Person2]:  I don't know why I cannot take a step forward. [Person1]:  You are meeting trouble halfway, I guess. [Person2]:  Many things are troubling me. I don't know whether I should come and go. [Person1]:  That's where the shoe pinches.

What can I do now? [Person2]:  Well if so. you should contact with the office over there. Maybe they will do you some help. [Person1]:  OK. thank you.
[Person1]:  Are you feeling all right, Mary? You look a little tired. [Person2]:  My brother and I had a birthday for my sister last night. So I didn't have much sleep. [Person1]:  Where did you have the party? [Person2]:  It was at my uncle's house. [Person1]:  Did you go back home very late? [Person2]:  Not really. But when I was home, I had to start typing a literature paper that was due first thing in the morning. [Person1]:  Couldn't you do it today? [Person2]:  No, our professor said she wouldn't accept any late papers. [Person1]:  Then how did you manage it? [Person2]:  Well, I just turned my paper in, and now I'm going home to bed. See you!
[Person1]:  This will be your office here. [Person2]:  Really? Wow, it is great. [Person1]:  We try to get everyone in the upper management team a nice office. [Person2]:  I suppose so. It's great. [Person1]:  I'm glad you like it. [Person2]:  Yes, is there a coffee machine around here? [Person1]:  Yes, we have a coffee machine and some other beverages in the break room. [Person2]:  Where is the break room? [Person1]:  It's just down the hall, the fourth door on your right. [Person2]:  Got it. [Person1]:  You can always call me if you need anything and I will get it for you. [Person2]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  I had a big argument with david yesterday. I hope he's not still mad at me. [Person2]:  what did you argue about? [Person1]:  he borrowed some money from me and I needed it back. He said he didn't have the money yet. [Person2]:  well, he should pay you back. It's only fair. [Person1]:  yes, but is got angry with him too quickly. He probably thought that I mistrusted him. I shouldn't have got angry. [Person2]:  did you lend him a lot of money? [Person1]:  not much. I had to pay an unexpected bill, so I needed the money back. [Person2]:  well, talk to him about it next time you see him. He probably feels as bad about it as you do. Close friends sometimes have disagreements. It's nothing unusual. Neither of you said anything r [Person1]:  no, we didn't. I guess you're right. We should patch things up. [Person2]:  of course you should. You wouldn't want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship, would you?
[Person1]:  Well, here is your breakfast! [Person2]:  Thanks so much. Miss, I believe I ordered my eggs scrambled, and these are fried. [Person1]:  Sorry, your friend over there ordered fried eggs, and I gave you his by mistake. [Person2]:  Oh yeah. Here, I will just trade with him. [Person1]:  Here are your pancakes, madam. [Person2]:  But I ordered waffles! [Person1]:  Oh, I am so sorry! [Person2]:  That's OK. I will eat my eggs and bacon, and you can take my pancakes back. [Person1]:  Good, sir. I will take care of that right away. [Person2]:  Thank you so much!
[Person1]:  So, you're going back to the United States tomorrow. [Person2]:  Yes, that's correct. I'm flying home. [Person1]:  I'm afraid of flying, are you? [Person2]:  No, flying is fine with me. [Person1]:  That's great. Er, back home, do you fly quite often for your job? [Person2]:  No, I go to the work by bus and drive to different business appointments, but sometimes I take the train to go to the business conferences in other cities or things like that. [Person1]:  I see. So tomorrow you will have a really long flight. [Person2]:  Yes, terribly long. [Person1]:  It's probably 15 or 16 hours, I suppose. [Person2]:  Mmm, from Shanghai to Boston, mmm, let me see, it is about 18 hours in the air. [Person1]:  So how do you pass the time on the plane? [Person2]:  I like to sleep as much as possible. [Person1]:  OK, do you take medicine or just have a beer or...? [Person2]:  No, no, I don't take any medicine. I tend to stay up late the day before, so that I'm tired and I want a sleep on the plane. [Person1]:  That's a good idea. And I hope you have a good flight. [Person2]:  Thank you very much.
[Person1]:  With us now, is Malcolm Bricklin, CEO of Visionary Vehicles. [Person2]:  Hello, everyone. [Person1]:  We have been hearing a couple of things about this news that Ford Motor Company is slashing up to 30,000 jobs, shutting down 14 plants nationwide. Is it a big deal if we are no longer manufacturing these cars, Malcolm? [Person2]:  I think it's a huge deal. I mean the companies are massive employers both directly and indirectly. If you look at Ford after their restructuring, they've actually got 87,000 employees which is twice as many as Microsoft have worldwide. Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products. [Person1]:  Er, it seems to indicate a big hit for our economy if these jobs go bye-bye. [Person2]:  Yeah, it's a really sad day for America. [Person1]:  But it is not as if cars are stopped being made, right? [Person2]:  Correct. Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity. So, it is not like there are fewer cars being produced in America than there were 30 years ago. [Person1]:  Let me ask you about the Chinese coming in. What would it mean to American jobs, if and when that happens? [Person2]:  The Chinese cars we have seen so far aren't that great and they don't have the branding necessary to make a huge impact in the world stage.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, sir, this is the express check-out lane for people that have fifteen items or fewer. It looks like you have more than fifteen items there.  [Person2]:  Oh, come on! I have sixteen items! Cut me some slack, will ya?  [Person1]:  Fine! Please place your items on the belt and push your shopping cart through. Do you prefer paper or plastic?  [Person2]:  Plastic. I also have a couple of coupons.  [Person1]:  No problem, I'll take those. Sir, these coupons expired yesterday.  [Person2]:  Darn! Oh, well. I guess it's just not my day. Thanks anyway.  [Person1]:  Do you have a club card or will it be cash?  [Person2]:  Yeah I got a club card. Here you go.  [Person1]:  Will this be debit or credit?  [Person2]:  Debit please. Also, could I get cash back? Fifty dollars would be great.  [Person1]:  Yeah, sure. Your total is seventy-eight dollars and thirty-three cents. Here is your receipt. Have a nice day. 
[Person1]:  Did you tip the bellboy?  [Person2]:  Yes, but I don't think it was enough. He looked disappointed. I gave him three dollars.  [Person1]:  That sounds about right to me, fifty cents a bag. If they think you don't know better, they'll try to get more.  [Person2]:  It's the same in Kauloon. But I definitely think we over-tipped the cab driver. The fare was twenty dollars, and you gave him a five-dollar tip. That's twenty-five percent of the total! Too much!  [Person1]:  I disagree. He was polite and informative, and he drove smoothly. One should reward good service.  [Person2]:  I'll sign for dinner and charge it to our room. Let's see. The bill is one hundred dollars. That seems reasonable. How much tip should I leave?  [Person1]:  Remember last month when we were in Europe? Maybe Californians use that same system they add the waiter or waitress into the bill, so you don't have to leave anything extra. 
[Person1]:  I heard that you went to the concert the day before? How did you like it?  [Person2]:  It was terrific. The concert was really a hit. The symphony orchestra was so good that I was completely absorbed in their performance.  [Person1]:  Who was the conductor?  [Person2]:  Oh, speaking of the conductor , he is indeed a genius. He did a perfect job. His name is Menuhin, a descendent of Russian American immigrants.  [Person1]:  Oh, I learned that he is also a legendary violinist.  [Person2]:  Absolutely right. He gave a performance of Felix Mendelssohn's violin concerto. That caused a sensation. The audience were stunned by his pure tone.  [Person1]:  Obviously you did enjoy the concert.  [Person2]:  Yes, I did. 
[Person1]:  Here you are at last! You're half an hour late, you know.  [Person2]:  I'm awfully sorry to have kept you waiting for so long.  [Person1]:  What happened?  [Person2]:  My watch stopped and I didn't know. I certainly need to buy a better one. 
[Person1]:  Dear Aaron, and how are you? [Person2]:  Quite well, thank you. [Person1]:  I'm celebrating my ninth birthday, the day after tomorrow. [Person2]:  Well, where is the function arranged? [Person1]:  It is arranged in a hotel. [Person2]:  Where is it? [Person1]:  It is just next to my house. [Person2]:  Will your uncle Vince attend the function? [Person1]:  No, but he has sent me a camera as my birthday present.
[Person1]:  Here is the wine list, Mike. [Person2]:  I would like some wine. [Person1]:  Yes, what will it be? [Person2]:  I'm sorry. I really don't know too much about wine. [Person1]:  May I make a suggestion? [Person2]:  Yes, of course. [Person1]:  Why don't you ask the waiter for advice? [Person2]:  That will be OK as long as it isn't too expensive.
[Person1]:  Here is the document you asked for this morning. [Person2]:  Oh, you are so efficient. I thought you might give it to me tomorrow. Thanks. [Person1]:  You ' re welcome. You know, these days I have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination. The more I think about it, the more I hate myself for being so disorganized. I decided to change the situation as soon as possible. Otherwise I will be more regretful later. [Person2]:  This is encouraging news, good for you! What is your solution, then? [Person1]:  The most useful method is to make plans and set priorities. It helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place. [Person2]:  Sounds not bad! Better performance isn ' t just about doing a lot more. It is about focusing on the right things to do.
[Person1]:  Here is your room. I hope you like it. [Person2]:  Looks not bad. [Person1]:  The room is away from traffic noise. [Person2]:  Yes, It's pleasantly quiet here. [Person1]:  Here's the bath. [Person2]:  Where can we have our laundry done? [Person1]:  There's a bag in the bathroom. Just put your laundry in it. [Person2]:  Does the hotel run its own laundry service? [Person1]:  We do, as most hotels do. [Person2]:  I see. Is the telephone on the table good for outside calls? [Person1]:  There is house phone only. But you can ask the operator for city calls. [Person2]:  Can I get a city map at the hotel? [Person1]:  Yes. Shall I get one for you? Just push the button over there if you need anything.
[Person1]:  When I quarrel with my husband. He didn't even try to cool me out. [Person2]:  It takes two to make a quarrel and it takes two to mend fences. [Person1]:  I was so angry that I could not keep cool. What I need is just an apology.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, sir. Could you spare a minute? [Person2]:  Uh, yes. [Person1]:  Do you go to work by train every day? [Person2]:  Yes. I commute five days a week by train. [Person1]:  And would you mind telling us what you think of the rail service? [Person2]:  It's really very good. [Person1]:  Why do you say that? [Person2]:  Well, trains are frequent and come on time. [Person1]:  Which train do you catch in the evening? [Person2]:  I usually take the 5 thirty home. [Person1]:  And can you get a seat? [Person2]:  No, I usually have to stand. [Person1]:  Would you agree that the service is fast? [Person2]:  Yes, it's reasonably fast but it certainly isn't cheap. Fares have gone up25 %.
[Person1]:  It's too hot to read.  [Person2]:  We'd better go out for a walk.  [Person1]:  Which season do you like best?  [Person2]:  Spring.  [Person1]:  How about summer?  [Person2]:  I dislike it most.  [Person1]:  Why?  [Person2]:  Because the hottest season is summer in a year.  [Person1]:  But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons. 
[Person1]:  I'm so hungry! I haven't late eaten all day! [Person2]:  Take your mind off it. Look, Crys. This magazine is on China's top ten beauties! [Person1]:  They're all so thin! Her cheekbones are great. [Person2]:  She doesn't have an ounce of fat on her face. [Person1]:  The mag says she's 165 centimeters tall and 38 kilos. If only we could be that thin then. . . [Person2]:  Not even drinking milk for one month would get us like that. [Person1]:  Oh, bathroom blues. [Person2]:  Look at this girl's gray dress. [Person1]:  I went to try it on yesterday, but it only came in extra small. [Person2]:  Last time I wore extra small was when I was in fifth grade. [Person1]:  ( Weigh herself ) Hey, I lost a kilo in a week with my all-fruit diet. If I keep going, I can wear that dress next month. [Person2]:  So why are you dieting this time anyway? Another guy? [Person1]:  Dieting. It's the price we pay to make men notice us. [Person2]:  The girls in this magazine are so slender. [Person1]:  They're also way younger than us. [Person2]:  True. You know, I First started dieting when I was ten. [Person1]:  You never worked out? [Person2]:  Oh, no. Too much work. I hate to sweat. It's so gross.

[Person1]:  Hi Benjamin. My name is Dr. Green. What seems to be the matter? [Person2]:  I've been feeling pretty ill for a few days now. [Person1]:  What are your symptoms? [Person2]:  I feel chilly, I've got cramps, I keep throwing up, and I feel dizzy and tired. [Person1]:  It sounds like you might be a bit dehydrated. Do you feel thirsty most of the day? [Person2]:  Yes. I can't seem to drink enough. [Person1]:  Have you been drinking plenty of water? [Person2]:  No, just soda. [Person1]:  Ok. Well, we'll have a nurse take some blood in a few minutes to see if you're dehydrated. First, let me feel your pulse. [Person2]:  That seems to be a bit low, but that's not uncommon when you're ill. [Person1]:  Is anyone else sick in your home? [Person2]:  No, but my girlfriend has mono. [Person1]:  I see. I'll have the lab techs run some tests to check for mono as well then. The nurse will come in then to take your blood, we'll run some tests, and then you can go home. You should hear from us by this afternoon. [Person2]:  Thanks.
[Person1]:  I have a feeling you will get this job. [Person2]:  Thanks. But I'm not so sure. Interviews stress me out. [Person1]:  Just remember to be professional and polite. Oh, and don't forget to smile. [Person2]:  I'll do my best, but sometimes I have trouble being myself in stressful situations. [Person1]:  Have you updated your resume recently? [Person2]:  Yes. . . ah! I forgot to include my e-mail address. [Person1]:  You'd better double-and-triple check it. You don't want to have any embarrassing typos on your resume.

Oh, do you have a reference letter? [Person2]:  Sort of. I prepared a list of all the people who can vouch for my experience and good work ethic. [Person1]:  I'm included on your list of references, right? My praise of you could really make a difference. [Person2]:  Sorry, you're not on it. I don't think using my brother as a reference would be very convincing!
[Person1]:  What's going on around here? Why is everyone changing offices? [Person2]:  Haven't you heard? Where have you been anyway? [Person1]:  I just got back from visiting the plant in Chicago. [Person2]:  Well, there are a lot of changes being made here this week. [Person1]:  Yes, I see. But what are they? [Person2]:  For one thing, Martha and Jim are leaving. [Person1]:  Where are they going?Did they get a higher position? [Person2]:  Martha's going to the office in Atlanta. She is going to be in charge of the whole southern market.

[Person2]:  Fine, here it is and have a great semester! 
[Person1]:  Have you heard that our boss wants Nancy to accept a 6-week job in Acapulco? [Person2]:  She'll really like that, especially since all of her cost will be paid and she can practice her Spanish, too. [Person1]:  Yes, but most of all, she'll get to spend her free time bathing in the sun on those lovely beaches. [Person2]:  When will she be leaving? [Person1]:  Since she doesn't need a passport, it'll probably be in about a week. [Person2]:  That doesn't give her much time to get organized.

With the cold and wet weather that we're supposed to have tomorrow, the roads are going to be rather slippery. [Person1]:  I suppose I should. I don't like driving in dangerous weather conditions. Do you have any plans for tomorrow? [Person2]:  I just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon. [Person1]:  if you're lucky, it'll get canceled and you can have a snow day!

[Person1]:  Hey, Jenny. Would you like to go to dinner with me?  [Person2]:  I don't know. You know what they say about office romances.  [Person1]:  No, I don't. What do they say about office romances?  [Person2]:  They say you shouldn't mix love and work.  [Person1]:  That's silly. What I do on my own time is no one else's business. Besides, it's pretty hard to meet people outside of the office when we spend long hours here.  [Person2]:  You've got a point. Once I dated one of my supervisors and all of my co-workers accused him of favoritism. Then when the relationship went bad, he fired me.  [Person1]:  People fall in love with people they work with. That's a fact.  [Person2]:  That may be true, but I don't want an inter-office relationship to affect my productivity.  [Person1]:  If it does, it will only make you more productive, because we can support each other.  [Person2]:  You are sounding like we are already married.  [Person1]:  Good grief. All I did was ask you out. I am sorry.  [Person2]:  Well, I don't feel right about it.  [Person1]:  I am talking about dinner tonight, not a lifetime.  [Person2]:  Most starts with dinner, but then it gets out of hand. Besides, haven't you asked out every woman in the entire office?  [Person1]:  I like company.  [Person2]:  Company? I heard about you from Linda. She said you were an octopus!  [Person1]:  What can I say? I am a passionate guy.  [Person2]:  Well, I hope you can find something else to be passionate about.  [Person1]:  You want to go out with me and you know it.  [Person2]:  In your dreams. Now if you don't mind, I've got some work to do.  [Person1]:  Ok, I get the message. Hey, do you have any sisters? 
[Person1]:  Why do you want to be a tour guide? [Person2]:  I like to travel and I also like meeting various kinds of people. [Person1]:  What courses have you completed at college? [Person2]:  I have studied English, tourist culture, guiding methods and techniques and so on. [Person1]:  Have you learned any other foreign languages?

[Person2]:  Your way does touch my heart.  [Person1]:  So, will you marry me?  [Person2]:  I want to think of it for some time. 
[Person1]:  Excuse me, but I think you've made a wrong turn. You were supposed to turn left on Wilson Blvd. [Person2]:  Oh, I'm sorry. Did you say 1323 Wilson? [Person1]:  No, it is 3023. It is OK though, you don't have to take me there, I can walk from here. [Person2]:  I can just make a U turn and so one way street. See the sign up ahead? Maybe if I turn left here, I can come down the next street. [Person1]:  We can't do that during the rush hour. Really, though it won't be much trouble, sometimes one can wait 30 minutes for a taxi. So I'm happy to get this close. [Person2]:  30 minutes? I've been riding around all day looking for passengers.
[Person1]:  I think I want to go back to school, Paul. [Person2]:  Well, that's a nice idea, Cindy. But what would you study? [Person1]:  I'm not sure. I've always been interested in psychology. I think I'd do really well. [Person2]:  Uh-huh, it's not that I don't believe in you, sweetheart. You were always a good student, but it's different when you're an adult going back to school. [Person1]:  Well, I don't think I would have any problems making friends. Lots of older folks get a second BA degree later in life, just like I would be doing and besides I've always been young at heart. I'm sure I'd get along with the other students. And I think I'd be an even better rider and test taker now. Then when I went to college in my late teens and early 20s. [Person2]:  Yeah, but that's not what I'm worried about honey. Have you given any thought to what you do when you graduate? [Person1]:  I suppose I'd look for a job. [Person2]:  And what do you know about jobs in the field of psychology? [Person1]:  Not too much I guess, but I could start small and work my way to the top. [Person2]:  That sounds like something a person might say about a big company on the Wall Street. Psychology is different. There just aren't that many jobs in that field right now and the ones that are out there don't pay much unless you have a PhD. I mean, we have 2 kids to feed, you know?
[Person1]:  What made you join the Tai Chi Club, Monica? [Person2]:  I used to like to play volleyball and tennis. Now, I just want to try a sport, which is not that intense for a change. [Person1]:  Why didn't you choose yoga? It's very popular nowadays, and also involves less physical intensity. [Person2]:  Well, another reason why I chose Tai Chi, was because I always have a fascination with Chinese culture. [Person1]:  How does Tai Chi relate to Chinese culture? I thought is just a way of exercise. [Person2]:  It's more than that, the core concept of Tai Chi is to find balance in your life, like if you eat too much, you'll become overweight. But if you don't eat enough, you'll suffer other health problems, the key is, never too much, nor too less. [Person1]:  Wow, that's deep, but you get tired after you do Tai Chi? I know you have heavy work. [Person2]:  Quite the opposite. After playing Tai Chi, my mind is more relaxed and it's much easier for me to get focused.
[Person1]:  Oh, well. It was fun to be the winner. But... it's too big. I must be an extra small in the States. [Person2]:  So what about the tennis racket? [Person1]:  Look! It's amazing. I can't wait to try it out! [Person2]:  How much did that end up costing you? [Person1]:  Oh... around twenty bucks. A bargain if you ask me. Look at the picture of her playing with it! [Person2]:  Hey, two for one. That's a super deal. [Person1]:  And here's her signature!
[Person1]:  Medicine Industry, this is Peter Bush speaking, can I help you? [Person2]:  Good afternoon, could you connect this call with Mr. Brown, please [Person1]:  May I know who's calling? [Person2]:  This is Li Ping of ABC computer company limited. I'm calling on our Mr. Wilson the general manager of our company. [Person1]:  I'm sorry, Mrs. Li, Mr. Brown is now in a meeting.May I have your number, and ask him to call you back later? [Person2]:  I'm afraid Mr. Wilson would like to speak to Mr. Brown right now.He ' s got an urgent matter to discuss with Mr. Brown without delay. [Person1]:  Ok, then would you please hold the line? Mr. Li, the line is through, Mr. Brown is ready answering the call, go ahead. [Person2]:  Thank you for your assistance, Mr. Bush. [Person1]:  You are welcome.
[Person1]:  Hello, is this the ABC company? [Person2]:  Yes, may I help you? [Person1]:  We have just arrived from Tokyo only... looking for a reserve car of your company. All of above, we cannot find it. [Person2]:  What is your reservation number? [Person1]:  Our reservation number is J - 221. [Person2]:  Let me see. Oh, yes, we have your reservation number. [Person1]:  You mean you haven ' t arranged any car? [Person2]:  I ' m sorry to say no. [Person1]:  Here I ' ll take taxi instead, how do you refund us?
[Person1]:  I wonder if it is possible that we organize a dinner party for all the colleagues in our departments. They are working very hard these days. Maybe it is time for everybody to relax a little. [Person2]:  That is a good idea, I love it. What time do you think is convenient? [Person1]:  Well, what about this Thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting? [Person2]:  Ok, I will inform everybody when they come back from lunch. It has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time. I am sure they don't want to miss it. [Person1]:  I hope so. Let me know how many will come. Then I will book the restaurant.
[Person1]:  Here you are at last! You're half an hour late, you know. [Person2]:  I'm awfully sorry to have kept you waiting for so long. [Person1]:  What happened? [Person2]:  My watch stopped and I didn't know. I certainly need to buy a better one.
[Person1]:  May, we are fools to hang out at noon. It's dying hot today. My skin is too weak to be exposed under the summer sun. [Person2]:  Do you have any sunscreen lotion? [Person1]:  You know, honey, I used it all on the way over. [Person2]:  I think I'm getting a heart stroke. [Person1]:  The heat is driving crazy and I hate my new hat. [Person2]:  Why? It's brand new, and it's perfect on you. [Person1]:  But I bought it to get rid of the heat. Now it does nothing but burning my head. [Person2]:  Beauty costs, honey. [Person1]:  Laugh all you want, whatever. We need to get out of the heat. [Person2]:  Walking under the sun is certainly not the way. [Person1]:  Give me a break. It's not funny. [Person2]:  Right. Sorry. Anyway, the radio said that it'll rain later today. [Person1]:  Hope so! Good thing is that autumn is just around the corner.
[Person1]:  Come in, please. [Person2]:  Good afternoon, Mrs. Smith. [Person1]:  Good afternoon. Have a seat, please. You are Mr. Sun? [Person2]:  Thank you. Yes, I am Dunlin. [Person1]:  I have read your resume. I know you have worked for 3 years. Why did you choose to major in mechanical engineering? [Person2]:  Many factors led me to major in mechanical engineering. The most important factor is I like tinkering with machines. [Person1]:  What are you primarily interested in about mechanical engineering? [Person2]:  I like designing products, and one of my designs received an award. Moreover, I am familiar with CAD. But I can do any mechanic well if I am employed. [Person1]:  Why did you decide to apply for this position? [Person2]:  Your company has a very good reputation, and I am very interested in the field your company is in. [Person1]:  What do you think determines an employee's progress in a company such as ours? [Person2]:  Interpersonal and technical skills. [Person1]:  We have several applicants for this position. Why do you think you are the person we should choose? [Person2]:  I have the abilities, qualities and experience that you requested in your job advert, for example I have three years experience in designing products and I got leadership experience while serving the college student union as president. [Person1]:  That sounds very good. How do you see your career development? [Person2]:  After a few years of gaining experience in the company and furthering my professional qualifications I'd like to put my experience and skills to use in management. I want to become a supervisor in your R & D department. [Person1]:  Have you anything to ask about the job? [Person2]:  Yes. Do you offer any opportunities for further study? [Person1]:  Yes. If you undertake additional courses, provided these are approved, and you complete them successfully, you can claim back part, quite a large part, 75 % of the costs you incurred. Not just the fees, - traveling and other expenses too. [Person2]:  That's fine. [Person1]:  Anything else? [Person2]:  No. [Person1]:  Well, thank you very much, Mr. Sun. I'll let you know the result of the interview as soon as possible. Goodbye. [Person2]:  Thank you, Mrs. Smith. I do hope the answer will be favorable. Goodbye.
[Person1]:  Hi, Mary, I have decided to look for a job as a salesman. [Person2]:  Good! Have you got the recruitment information on marketing? [Person1]:  Yes. I have found some through different channels. [Person2]:  Really? That's great! Tell me. [Person1]:  OK. The first piece of job information I got was from the Internet, and it is about selling medicines. [Person2]:  What do you think of this job? [Person1]:  I am not familiar with the medicine industry, and I don't think it fits me well. [Person2]:  Then how about the others? [Person1]:  Another is about electronic commerce, and its products are mainly large machinery equipments. [Person2]:  I have heard about electronic commerce, and many people say it has good prospects for development. [Person1]:  I also feel it's nice. I want to give it a try. [Person2]:  Come on! I believe you will succeed. [Person1]:  Thanks. You can also seek job information on the Internet. [Person2]:  Good idea. I will think it over.
[Person1]:  How do you dispose of the waste in your factory? [Person2]:  We try to recycle as much as we can. [Person1]:  What about the rest? How do you get rid of it? [Person2]:  We have to send it to landfill. It's very expensive because the government recently introduced a landfill tax so we're planning to build a new incineration plant next year to burn our waste. [Person1]:  But doesn't incineration produce carbon monoxide? [Person2]:  Yes, you're right, it does. But we believe it's less harmful to the environment than landfill
[Person1]:  Hello. Good evening. [Person2]:  Hello, may I please speak to George Hatton? [Person1]:  To whom, did you say? [Person2]:  George Hatton. [Person1]:  I'm sorry but no one of that name lives here. What number are you calling? [Person2]:  123-4567. [Person1]:  That's our number all right but no Mr. Hatton lives here. This is the Smith residence. [Person2]:  Oh, I must have the wrong number. I'm terribly sorry. [Person1]:  That's all right. I hope you find Mr. Hatton. Good-bye. [Person2]:  Good-bye and thank you.
[Person1]:  Sue? Do you want to join the softball team? We need another player.  [Person2]:  I haven't played softball since I was in high school!  [Person1]:  Come on! It'll be fun. We play every other Saturday afternoon from May until August.  [Person2]:  Okay. I guess I could give it a try. 
[Person1]:  Honey, we still have some extra money after buying the TV set last week. If you want to buy something else, you can. [Person2]:  Well, I need a bike. I don't want to go to work by bus anymore. There are so many people on the bus sometimes that I just can't get on it. [Person1]:  What do you think of walking to work for exercise? I actually think you need a new computer. Your old one is pretty slow. [Person2]:  Yes, I do need a computer. Then I will give up on the bike idea. Then I could have $400 to buy a new computer. [Person1]:  Not just $400. I can give you $100 more than that. If you're going to buy a computer, you should buy a good one.
[Person1]:  Good afternoon, Royal Bank. How may I help you? [Person2]:  Hello. I have an account with your bank and I'd like to have a copy of my bank statement. I tried to reach you this morning but the lines were all busy. Can I request a statement over the phone? [Person1]:  Unluckily you can't. However you can get it on the bank's website but to use the website, you need to register as a member. [Person2]:  Alright. I'll just check the website. Can you give me the website address? [Person1]:  OK.
[Person1]:  Jonas, have you finished the report yet? [Person2]:  I'm afraid I'm still reading through all these papers. Do you need it right now? [Person1]:  I don't, but Mr. Steadman will be asking about it soon. You know, he always starts to get anxious about the weekly report about this time of the day. [Person2]:  But it's only Thursday morning. We have a day and a half left before he needs it. And what if something big happens today? [Person1]:  I know. The report should include everything from the week, but he just likes to know that we're not finishing it off at the last minute. [Person2]:  When have I ever done that? [Person1]:  Of course, you never would. But last month, we had a lot of trouble getting the reports in on time. [Person2]:  Well, good thing he hired me.
[Person1]:  Father sent me to the school to pick you up this afternoon. But you were not there. What were you guys doing, William? [Person2]:  Our music club held an activity in the shopping center then. [Person1]:  What activity? You didn't tell us anything about it. [Person2]:  So sorry. I should have told mom and dad and you last night. But I was afraid I would be too nervous to play well if they went there. Mrs. Smith took us there. She has been preparing us for this free performance for a month. [Person1]:  It's OK? What did you do then? [Person2]:  In the beginning, we all walked in the shopping center like we were shopping there. A few minutes later, one of our members began to play the violin in the center on the first floor. With that music, we all quickly gathered there one by one and joined to play. [Person1]:  You mean you held the performance among passers-by? [Person2]:  Yes, we played 4 pieces of music in total. So many people stood around us and recorded it with their cameras and cell phones. [Person1]:  You did well. Your performance is very meaningful.
[Person1]:  Hi, Ted. I have some good news for you. [Person2]:  What is it? [Person1]:  There will be a writing competition in our school next week. Since you are good at writing, you might be interested. [Person2]:  What is the topic for this competition? [Person1]:  My ideal city. You can write about a city that you want it to be. [Person2]:  That's great. I've thought about this for a long time. I want my ideal city to be neither too big nor too small. I hope it's a green city. [Person1]:  What do you mean by a green city? Do you want to plant a lot of trees in the city? [Person2]:  Green here means environmentally friendly. I want people in the city to use clean energy. [Person1]:  Now I see. Do you know what the prize for this year's competition is? You may not believe it. [Person2]:  Is it a big sum of money? [Person1]:  No, it's a two week holiday to some European countries. [Person2]:  Oh, I prefer to go to Asia. I've traveled to Europe many times.
[Person1]:  Hello Mr. Jones, please have a seat. Thank you for coming in today. I have read your resume. You completed University in England? [Person2]:  Yes, I went to Cambridge. After graduation, I started right away into the advertising industry. Later, I made a bit of a switch to focus on marketing research. [Person1]:  So, what experience do you have? [Person2]:  I have ten years marketing experience. This includes both entry level and management positions. In my last position, I worked my way up to being director of the marking department. [Person1]:  I can see that from your resume.Your last position was marketing director for a pharmaceutical company, is that right? Later, why did you decide to leave your former post? [Person2]:  I felt after five years in one place, I was ready for something new. I would like to have a job that is challenging, something that I can see and do new things every day. I loved many things about my former job, and I left with amiable feelings on both sides. I was just ready for something new. [Person1]:  I see. Do you want to work full-time or part-time? [Person2]:  I would rather work full-time. [Person1]:  I'll make note of that. Now, what are your salary expectations? [Person2]:  I am willing to negotiate, but I expect at least $ 40, 000 a year.
[Person1]:  Hello, uh I'm a first-time caller. My problem is that my father went away on a business trip and I borrowed his new car, but I had an accident. I was not hurt, but the car was broken. [Person2]:  Where is your mother? [Person1]:  She is away, visiting some friends. [Person2]:  Alright, go on. [Person1]:  Well, I told my father the car was lossed. Someone had stolen it. [Person2]:  Oh, you should've told your father the truth. He would understand about a car accident and he would be glad you weren't hurt. [Person1]:  I'm not too sure about that. [Person2]:  Give it a try, young man, because the truth is always better than a lie. [Person1]:  OK. I think you're right.
[Person1]:  Do you want to go to the beach tonight? [Person2]:  Sure, which beach are we going to? [Person1]:  I wanted to go to Malibu beach. [Person2]:  I like Santa Monica. [Person1]:  The water there looks so dirty. [Person2]:  I just like the pier they have at Santa Monica. [Person1]:  I like the pier too, because it's beautiful at night. [Person2]:  Is Malibu beach nice? [Person1]:  It's a lot nicer, and I really like it better. [Person2]:  So you want to go to Malibu? [Person1]:  If that's okay with you. [Person2]:  Sure, let's go to Malibu.
[Person1]:  Where did you get your mobile? It's really cute. [Person2]:  Oh, this? I got it in Singapore. Here, do you want to take a look? [Person1]:  Thanks. Gee, it's really light! [Person2]:  Yes, it is, isn't it? A bit too light, really. What make have you got? [Person1]:  I've got an old Ericsson. Here. Take a look. [Person2]:  Wow, that's really old. [Person1]:  Yes, I like collecting antiques. [Person2]:  Why don't you get a new one? [Person1]:  I don't know. I like this one, and I don't have any need for all the bells and whistles you get on the new ones. [Person2]:  Really, what makes you say that? [Person1]:  Well, I just need to make and receive calls, and it's quite reliable. I find that the more fancy stuff they put into these things, the more likely they are to break bown or go wrong, you know? I mean, this camera function, for instance-how often do you use it? [Person2]:  Sometimes, but I guess not very often. It's more for fun. Sometimes when I'm on a trip, for example, I can take a picture and send it to my kids. Or I can send a picture of a sample back to my office and get it costed up immediately. [Person1]:  Well, that's nice I guess. So how many kids do you have? [Person2]:  Three. Two boys and a girl.
[Person1]:  Julia, will you be my wife? [Person2]:  I'm sorry, Steven. [Person1]:  Please, Julia, I have made proposal to you five times. I really want to share the rest of my life with you. [Person2]:  I know. But I'm not ready for married life yet. [Person1]:  Julia, I really love you. I hope I can stay with you no matter you are happy or sad in future. [Person2]:  Your way does touch my heart. [Person1]:  So, will you marry me? [Person2]:  I want to think of it for some time.
[Person1]:  Beautiful weather, isn't it? [Person2]:  Yes, it is. Are you here on business? [Person1]:  No, I'm on a vacation to see the famous Three Gorges. [Person2]:  I'm going there for a tour, too. Is this your first trip to China? [Person1]:  Yes, it is. [Person2]:  Why don't we go together? I can show you around. I think you'll have a better time. [Person1]:  I couldn't agree more. [Person2]:  Great, let's go!
[Person1]:  What's your schedule like this year? [Person2]:  Pretty busy. I have to pick up a lot of credits this year. [Person1]:  What's your major? [Person2]:  I'm majoring in French literature. [Person1]:  Oh, don't you have to take that class on 18th century poetry? It's really difficult. I hear the students in that class have to write a paper a hundred pages long. [Person2]:  That's right. We got the assignment last week. [Person1]:  When is it due? [Person2]:  Next Monday. [Person1]:  Remind me never to sign up for that course.
[Person1]:  Steven, have you got better now? [Person2]:  Yeah, the doctor said that I can leave soon. I really miss home. [Person1]:  I guess you miss your wife and children very much. [Person2]:  Yeah, you are right. But I have to stay for another day for observation. [Person1]:  If necessary, I can stay here to accompany you until you are discharged. [Person2]:  No, thanks. I am very grateful that you can come to the hospital to visit me. [Person1]:  You are my best friend. That's what I should do. Please don't be a stranger.
[Person1]:  How have you been feeling lately? [Person2]:  I'Ve been feeling a little light-headed lately. [Person1]:  Has your blood pressure been high before? [Person2]:  If I have high blood pressure, it is news to me. [Person1]:  Usually people with high blood pressure have no symptoms, so we call it the silent killer. [Person2]:  What do you use to check for high blood pressure? [Person1]:  I am going to put a cuff on you to get a reading. [Person2]:  What does the reading tell you? [Person1]:  I get an idea of the pressure in your arteries when your heart is pumping blood versus at rest. [Person2]:  I hope that the test results show me to be really healthy.
[Person1]:  Can I see your passport, please? [Person2]:  Is this line for non-residents? [Person1]:  Yes it is. Residents can queen up in the lines to my right. [Person2]:  Ok. Here's my passport. [Person1]:  What's the expiration date on your passport? [Person2]:  I think it's soon, maybe in a few months. It was renewed in Beijing, so the new expiry date is on the last page. [Person1]:  I see. Yes, you'll need to renew your passport in a few months. Make sure you don't let it expire while you are in the UK. [Person2]:  I won't. [Person1]:  Do you have anything to declare? [Person2]:  No, I don't have anything to declare. [Person1]:  How long will you be staying in the UK? [Person2]:  I'll be here for about a year. [Person1]:  What is the purpose of your stay? [Person2]:  I'll be studying. I'm doing an MBA at Nottingham University. [Person1]:  Where will you be staying? [Person2]:  I have a housing contract with the university. I'll be in a dorm room on campus. [Person1]:  How do you plan on paying for your living costs and tuition fees while you are here? [Person2]:  My father has already paid for that in advance. Here are the receipts. [Person1]:  Ok. Have a good stay. Here's your passport and documents back. [Person2]:  Thank you very much.
[Person1]:  So how did I do? [Person2]:  Not too good, I'm sorry. [Person1]:  I lost? [Person2]:  It was close. To be honest, you had the lowest price by three cents per hint, but they didn't like your delivery date. Acme promised them almost a full month sooner. [Person1]:  So the price was good? [Person2]:  Yes, they loved the price, the delivery date was the problem. They just didn't want to cut the delivery date that close. If something went wrong and you didn't deliver, we might not be able to get stock in time for Christmas. If you could have been two or three weeks faster on delivery, they might have gone with you. [Person1]:  So I didn't miss by much then. [Person2]:  No. It was very close and they argued over the bid for a long time. Better luck next time. [Person1]:  I knew the delivery was slow but I figured the price would win it for me. [Person2]:  That's possible, Bill. But the price would have to have been a lot lower, like around fifty cents per unit.
[Person1]:  Good morning, Dr. Ellis' Office. [Person2]:  This is Mrs. Jackson. May I speak to the doctor? [Person1]:  Mrs. Jackson, Dr. Ellis is here. How's that new tooth? [Person2]:  Not so good, doctor. That's what I'm calling about. It just doesn't seem to fit right. [Person1]:  Well, that's to be expected during the first few days after it has been put in. Have you been leaving it in as I told you? [Person2]:  Well, it hurts so much, doctor, especially when I eat. [Person1]:  I understand, Mrs. Jackson. It hurts in the beginning, I know. But it's really better to leave it in, except when you clean it of course. [Person2]:  Well, I did at first, doctor, but it hurt so much that I just couldn't stand it any longer. [Person1]:  Well, maybe we can set it a little more. [Person2]:  Set it right? [Person1]:  Yes. When can you come here? [Person2]:  Oh, right away, doctor, if you don't mind. [Person1]:  Let me see, can you get here by 11 [Person2]:  Oh, yes, doctor. I can make it. Thank you. See you then.
[Person1]:  Good evening. For today's program, we have invited Sophie, a lady, who worked as a nurse during World War 2. [Person2]:  Good evening. At the beginning of World War 2, the government called on all its citizens 18 years old and over to help out. I started training as a nurse in November 1940. It was 2 months of being taught basic skills in the school of nursing. [Person1]:  What happened to you during the sudden attack, you know when Nazi Germany dropped bombs on Britain? [Person2]:  Manchester was bombed on the twenty-second and twenty-third of December 1940. On December twenty-forthth, I received an order requesting my immediate return from leave for duties of nursing the wounded. Many volunteers in the Manchester social services have taken a week's leave for the Christmas holidays. So the Manchester city rest centers were short of staff. Christmas Day was therefore my first day of nursing.
[Person1]:  Hey Lucy, I have a question I'd like to ask you. [Person2]:  Yes, go ahead. [Person1]:  Well, don't laugh. But I met this really nice woman through an online music group. I need some advice. You see, Claudia. [Person2]:  Ok, so it's Claudia. [Person1]:  Yeah yeah, she invited me to spend 2 weeks in Germany. She is planning on introducing me to her parents. What should you do when you greet someone for the first time in Germany? [Person2]:  Well, it depends upon your relationship with the person. Now Speaking of your girlfriend Claudia. [Person1]:  Hey, I didn't say she was my girlfriend. [Person2]:  Oh, ok ok, now, if you're meeting someone for the first time, like Claudia's parents, you should make sure you arrive on time. [Person1]:  Ok, so arrive on time. Uh, what about common greetings? [Person2]:  Well, Germans often shake hands and they use the person's family name unless they're really close friends. [Person1]:  Ok. What about with Claudia? [Person2]:  Uh, you can call her Claudia, shake hands and why don't you take her some flowers?
[Person1]:  Oxford Travel Agency, how may I help you? [Person2]:  Hello, I'd like to ask about the package tour from Newcastle to London. [Person1]:  Sure, what's your question? [Person2]:  Your website says that the trip starts off every Thursday. Can I join the trip on July thirtieth? [Person1]:  Sorry, I'm afraid it's full. How many people are going? [Person2]:  My husband and our two children will go with me. [Person1]:  4 people then. There is still enough places on August sixth. Will that do? [Person2]:  That's fine. Any discount for children under 12? [Person1]:  Sorry, the price for children is the same, 700 pounds each person. It's already cheaper than other agencies. [Person2]:  Alright, I'd like to book it. My name is Lisa Garcia and my number is 1-976-344-5829. [Person1]:  OK, Miss Garcia, be sure to pay for it either online or at our agency at least 5 days before departure. [Person2]:  I see, thanks.
[Person1]:  Good afternoon. British Airline. Is there any thing I can do for you? [Person2]:  Can I make a reservation for flight FW58 to San Marino? [Person1]:  Sure. When do you want to take the plane? [Person2]:  Next Monday. [Person1]:  Will that be first class or economy seat? [Person2]:  What's the fare for a first class seat? [Person1]:  $ 200. [Person2]:  Oh. I am not a wall streeter. Give me an economy one please.
[Person1]:  Hey, son, are you insured? [Person2]:  Not yet, but I'm thinking of it. Have you bought one, Dad? [Person1]:  I took out a life insurance policy and made your mother the beneficiary. [Person2]:  Can you tell me why you want to buy it? [Person1]:  I am a fireman and it is a dangerous job. I have to consider your mother's life. [Person2]:  Oh, I see. Do you advise me to buy one? [Person1]:  You have children now. What if something, God forbid, happens to you? [Person2]:  That's true. Well, how much do you think I should get? [Person1]:  A $ 100 000 policy shouldn't be too expensive. Here, call my agent. He'll give you a good deal.
[Person1]:  Mr. Carmichael, this is Ellen Bower calling again. You had said I should call this week to schedule an interview with you. [Person2]:  That's right, Ms. Bower. How are you? I'm not sure if I'll be able to fit you in this week, I'm afraid. [Person1]:  I understand, Mr. Carmichael. I'd be glad to make it some time next week. [Person2]:  All right, then. Why don't we say next Tuesday at 11
[Person1]:  Do you like swimming? [Person2]:  Yes. Swimming is one of my most favorite sports, indoors or out-doors. [Person1]:  Me too. Swimming is a very good exercise for health. It combines water, bath, sunbath, and air bath together. It promotes the growth and haleness of muscles, bone, viscera and nerve systems. [Person2]:  I have never thought that swimming can bring us so many benefits. I only know that swimming in great waves and deep running water can train people's spirits, and enable people to be fearless of the hardships, dangers and difficulties and become brave and staunch. [Person1]:  Have you ever swum in a river or a lake? [Person2]:  Yes, but not always. However, I won't let it go if I have a chance.
[Person1]:  Hello, do you remember me? I bought some vases from you yesterday. [Person2]:  eyes, you sent them to New York, right? [Person1]:  That's right. I thought I'd come back to buy a few more souvenirs. [Person2]:  What did you have in mind? [Person1]:  Well, first, I'd like to buy a few postcards. My sister used to always send a postcard to herself whenever she went anywhere. I want to do that, too. [Person2]:  We have plenty of postcards to choose from here. The same designs can be found on these posters. [Person1]:  Posters are difficult to travel with. I think I'll just buy the postcards. I heard that you might also have some of the masks that are made in Venice. [Person2]:  Yes, we do. They're on the wall behind you. [Person1]:  How much do they cost? [Person2]:  The prices are clearly marked on the back of each mask. Would you like me to get one down for you to look at? [Person1]:  Yes, I think I'd like the green mask in the middle. [Person2]:  Here you go. [Person1]:  I'll take it, I'd also like to buy some chocolate. [Person2]:  Are you looking for some homemade chocolate as a gift? [Person1]:  Yes, it's my girlfriend's birthday today and she loves chocolate. [Person2]:  We've got plenty to choose from here. [Person1]:  They look delicious. I think she'll be pleased.
[Person1]:  Something's wrong with my computer. [Person2]:  Exactly what? [Person1]:  All I get is a black screen. [Person2]:  What's the matter? [Person1]:  I think I know, because this happened before. [Person2]:  What happened before? [Person1]:  My hard drive crashed. [Person2]:  Oh, no. That's bad news. [Person1]:  It sure is, but I'm going to call HP first, just to make sure. [Person2]:  Will you lose all your files? [Person1]:  No, I always back up my files. [Person2]:  You're smart.
[Person1]:  Do you have any questions? [Person2]:  Tell me about fees. [Person1]:  What fees are you referring to? [Person2]:  I want to know about overdraft fees. [Person1]:  We charge a small fee every time you overdraft. [Person2]:  How much? [Person1]:  For each time you overdraft, you have to pay $ 25. [Person2]:  That's not a small fee. [Person1]:  You shouldn't overdraft. [Person2]:  That's for sure. [Person1]:  Do you need help with anything else? [Person2]:  That's all I needed to know. Thanks.
[Person1]:  Good afternoon. May I help you? [Person2]:  Yes, I'm here to see Joanna Stevens. I have an appointment at four. [Person1]:  Certainly, may I take your name? I'll let her know you'Ve arrived. [Person2]:  Sure, it's Josh O'Neil. [Person1]:  Ms. Stevens will be with you momentarily. Can I offer you something to drink? [Person2]:  Yes, a coffee would be nice, thank you. [Person1]:  Here you are. Ms. Stevens is ready for you now. I'll show you to her office, right this way.
[Person1]:  This is IBA Bank, Claire speaking, how may I help you? [Person2]:  Oh, hello, yes, arm. . . I've just lost my bank stuff. [Person1]:  I'm sorry, could you be a little more specific? [Person2]:  You know my bank stuff. My card, my book. . . [Person1]:  OK, I will have to take some details from you. Could you tell me your name, please? [Person2]:  Jim Chan. The account's in my name. Is that all you need to know? [Person1]:  Not quite, Sir. We will need to also know the account number, the deposited amount and your PIN number. You will also have to come in and fill out some forms.
[Person1]:  Where are we going now? [Person2]:  We are going to Jingshan Park. Originally it was an imperial garden while it is now a public park. [Person1]:  Where is it? [Person2]:  It is at the north of Forbidden City, on the central axis of Beijing. [Person1]:  What can we see in it? [Person2]:  Jingshan consists of five individual peaks, and there lies an elaborate pavilion on the top of each peak. These pavilions were used for gathering and leisure time. These five peaks also draw the approximate historical axis of central Beijing. [Person1]:  Anything else? [Person2]:  According to the dictates of Eng Shut, it is favorable to site a residence to the south of a nearby hill. When the capital was moved to Beijing, no hill existed at this location, so one was constructed. It is called ' Coal Hill '. The last emper-or of Ming Dynasty, Chongzhen, committed suicide by hanging himself here in 1644. [Person1]:  Tragedy. [Person2]:  Jingshan Park is especially a popular place for old people socializing and gathering. People can often find elder folks dancing, singing opera and other cultural activities at Jingshan Park.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, I need to get to Cambridge today. [Person2]:  Would you like to go by train or by bus? [Person1]:  I am not sure, which one is better? [Person2]:  The bus is cheaper but also slower. It will take about two-and-a-half hours. [Person1]:  And how long does the train take? [Person2]:  If you take the fast train, it will take about 50 minutes. [Person1]:  Where do I catch the train? [Person2]:  The trains for Cambridge leave from King's Cross Station. They run approximately every half hour. Most trains to Cambridge go from Platform 9. [Person1]:  How do I get to King's Cross? [Person2]:  The best way is to take an underground tube train directly to King's Cross. The Underground station is just round the corner from here. [Person1]:  Can you show me on the map? [Person2]:  It is very easy. Just turn right when you leave and then turn right again at the first crossroads. The entrance to the Underground station is about 50 meters further on. [Person1]:  Thank you very much. [Person2]:  You're welcome.
[Person1]:  Cool camera. What are its features? [Person2]:  It's loaded! For example, it's got a 256 color, LCD screen that rotates 360 degrees, and switches to black and white in power save mode. Also, it has a low-light mode for night shooting and touch screen menu controls that are really convenient. [Person1]:  What about the quality of the pictures? [Person2]:  Oh, it's the usual 5600x3200 resolution with 10. 0 megapixels. It's got a 5xzoom, so from 28mm to 120mm the pictures look great! I can change the resolution, too. [Person1]:  Wow! What about the memory? [Person2]:  It has a built-in hard-wired memory, but I like to use the 64MB media cards that come with it. I can download everything onto the hard drive and then edit and enhance with different software. It takes fantastic pictures that I can either print out or E-mail to my friends.
[Person1]:  What reasons do westerners drink for? [Person2]:  I don't think drinking requires any special purposes. For us people in the West, the purpose is generally quite simple-to savor the wine. [Person1]:  I know what you mean there. In many circumstances, people kiss the baby for the nurse's sake. And that's what we do when drinking at a banquet. Even though we do have a rich variety of brand-name wines, like Matai and Showing Yellow Rice Wine, alcohol is usually served not for the enjoyment itself. We just be its Dionysus effect to enliven the atmosphere, improve personal association with each other and solidify friendship. [Person2]:  And to make matters worse, you're urged to drink ' one more cup time and again. There is too much etiquette to observe. You'II be set free at a Western banquet It seems we are keen to make it convenient as possible to savor the wine, its color, its aroma and its delicate taste. [Person1]:  Yeah. It's of supreme importance that the goblet, table-cloth, and plates should be made shiningly clean, so that the color of the wine is clearly visible and the delicate aroma and taste are fully appreciable. [Person2]:  Yes. For me, who can't hold much liquor, it's particularly agreeable. If only I had thechance to enjoy Chinese Matai at a leisured pace while sitting at a Western banquet!
[Person1]:  Did you order the cake?  [Person2]:  Oh,I forgot.  [Person1]:  Get on the phone right now. It might not be too late.  [Person2]:  I'm so sorry! OK, so you just want a simple message on it.  [Person1]:  Yeah. How about 'Happy Birthday Tony, from the gang. '  [Person2]:  I'm on it! 
[Person1]:  The Canada Day is on the 1st of July.  [Person2]:  What is its national anthem?  [Person1]:  The national anthem of Canada is 'O Canada'.  [Person2]:  Can you sing the song?  [Person1]:  Yes, I could sing it when I was very young. 
[Person1]:  Have you graduated now? [Person2]:  Yes. I graduated this past June. [Person1]:  Which university did you graduate from? [Person2]:  Guangzhou University. [Person1]:  What degree did you receive? [Person2]:  I received a bachelor's degree in Economics. [Person1]:  What courses did you take in college? [Person2]:  My major courses were Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, International Trade, International Finance, World Economy, Psychology and Business English [Person1]:  Why did you choose to study Economics? [Person2]:  Because I was quite interested in Economics then. [Person1]:  Can you speak other languages except English? [Person2]:  I can also speak a little Japanese. [Person1]:  I am very satisfied with your answers. [Person2]:  Thank you very much.
[Person1]:  Look! Someone is celebrating his birthday.  [Person2]:  This must be his 21st birthday. No doubt about it.  [Person1]:  Why? Do you know that guy?  [Person2]:  No. Well, in America, 21 is the age when you're allowed to drink. So, many guys celebrate it in bars.  [Person1]:  That's interesting. But it would be really expensive, I suppose. Just think about all the drinks.  [Person2]:  No. If it's your birthday, then you don't need to pay a cent. Just blow out the candles and open the gifts. That makes the birthday a special day. Your friends will take care of everything.  [Person1]:  Wow. That's wonderful.  [Person2]:  What about in China? What'd you do to celebrate your birthday?  [Person1]:  Nowadays, it's no difference from America. But in old times, we have traditional ways to celebrate it. 
[Person1]:  What is the most unexpected thing you experienced in space?  [Person2]:  I wasn't quite prepared for the view of the Earth as we left. It was just awe-inspiring. It emerged from just a slightly curved horizon to a whole Earth , where you could look across oceans and continents in a single glance. I wasn't quite prepared for that. It's inevitably etched in my memory.  [Person1]:  When viewing the Earth from space,do you feel detached from humanity or more a part of the totality of humankind?  [Person2]:  Detached. You're literally detached from one planet, captured by another. Your only link to reality is the Earth out there;fortunate-1y,it stays in view the whole time.  [Person1]:  There're a lot of suspicions that the International Space Station is never going to become reality. Is it going to be some future project that never happens?  [Person2]:  I believe it's certainly for real. It without question has suffered a lot of delays. But there's hardware sitting on the pad right now and it's due to go off in December. It is a reality. It has just taken longer to get literally off the ground.  [Person1]:  There were a lot of talks during the Bush administration about a not too distant future Mars mission. It seemed to fizzle out. Do you think that this Shuttle mission will reignite the public's passion for space and get us to Mars sooner?  [Person2]:  I hope this flight is not just a one-time affair, that it does re-ignite people's interest to push on. But only time will tell.  [Person1]:  You had gone to the moon twice, orbited space around the Earth lots of times, and of course you have had the most amazing views that a human being can have. How long do we ordinary beings have to wait to feel the weightlessness? I just can't wait.  [Person2]:  If I were the man making the decisions, you could get in line tomorrow. I strongly support ordinary people going into space. Unfortunately, I don't think it will be in the near future. 
[Person1]:  Wow! What's the hold up? [Person2]:  It ' s probably just people trying to get an early start out of the city for the weekend. Nobody sticks around in the summer. [Person1]:  Really? Then, I guess I won ' t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab? [Person2]:  Actually, you might because there ' s a big convention in town this weekend. [Person1]:  I ' m not too worried about it. I always seem to find something.
[Person1]:  Hello. Is this room service? [Person2]:  Yes. May I help you? [Person1]:  This is room 1425. We asked for the room service an hour ago. [Person2]:  We're very sorry to cause you a lot of inconvenience. [Person1]:  What's the matter? [Person2]:  We're rather busy right now. It will take another 15 minutes. [Person1]:  Is it really going to take that long? Will you rush the order? [Person2]:  I'm afraid it would take 15 minutes at most. [Person1]:  Ah, well, we have no choice.
[Person1]:  Hello, Jack here. [Person2]:  Hello, Jack. It's Mary. What are you doing in your office? [Person1]:  I'm working. I often work late on Thursday. I'm busy this week. [Person2]:  Would you like to come and have dinner with us on Friday? [Person1]:  Tomorrow? No, I am afraid I won't be able to. I'm going on business to Birmingham. [Person2]:  What about Saturday? [Person1]:  Sorry, I never go out on Saturday evening. I always watch football on Saturday evening. [Person2]:  Will you come round next Tuesday? [Person1]:  Next Tuesday? Just a moment. It will be the twenty-first of May? Oh, dear. Hum, I promised my aunt I'll be at her birthday party. [Person2]:  What do you say next Wednesday then? [Person1]:  Let me see. Yes, Mary. Let's make it next Wednesday. [Person2]:  Okay. Bye. [Person1]:  Bye.
[Person1]:  John, you look pale. What happened? [Person2]:  I stayed up last night. [Person1]:  Did you have something on your mind? You look so concerned! Maybe I can help you! [Person2]:  Will, I'm under a lot of pressure. My manager is very pushy. He assigned me two projects. Now the deadlines are near but I have finished neither of them. [Person1]:  Is there anything I can do for you? [Person2]:  Well, I guess no one can help me but myself. For the moment, I just need someone to talk to so that I can relieve my stress. [Person1]:  I know your feeling. Take it easy and say something to me if you like. [Person2]:  Oh, buddy, you are so kind. Thank you! [Person1]:  Not at all!
[Person1]:  Excuse me. Can I ask you a question? [Person2]:  Sure. What is it? [Person1]:  I don't know how to say it in English. [Person2]:  We call this a'parking meter'. [Person1]:  Oh, Thank you. But how do you spell it? [Person2]:  P-a-r-k-i-n-g m-e-t-e-r.
[Person1]:  Lucy, I'd like to fix the light in the corridor, it keeps flashing, which drives me crazy. Would you like to help me with the ladder? [Person2]:  Monica, wait a moment. I think we'd better call the repairman to do it. [Person1]:  I think I can handle it by myself. [Person2]:  I'd like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company. [Person1]:  I see. If I got hurt when fixing the light, even during office hours, I wouldn't get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility. [Person2]:  Other company rules also need your attention. [Person1]:  Like this one? [Person2]:  Never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder. [Person1]:  Yeah, thank you for telling me. [Person2]:  Don't mention it.
[Person1]:  I think we have had a very pleasant conversation, haven't we? [Person2]:  Yes, I think so too. [Person1]:  Do you have any other questions? [Person2]:  Let me think. . . I want to know if the company can provide free accommodation for a new employee. [Person1]:  I'm sorry we can't now. [Person2]:  I really hope that your company could provide living places ; otherwise I have to rent a house to live. [Person1]:  Maybe the company will build dormitory for the employees in the future. [Person2]:  That would work too. [Person1]:  Anything else? [Person2]:  Some companies will pay part of the phone bills for the employees. Will this company do so? [Person1]:  I'm sorry we won't do so for a new employee. We only provide this benefit to employees who have made significant contributions to the company. [Person2]:  I understand. Will the company provide training? [Person1]:  Yes, we will, and the staff will have a chance to travel every year. [Person2]:  That's great. Thank you very much.
[Person1]:  Hello, I need to come in and see the doctor. [Person2]:  Are you scheduling a check-up, or are you ill? [Person1]:  I have really itchy skin and think I may have to have it looked at. [Person2]:  Have you been feeling any joint aches with that rash? [Person1]:  No, but I have a low fever. [Person2]:  I have times available for Tuesday or Wednesday. Which one would work best for you? [Person1]:  I want to come in on Wednesday. [Person2]:  I can fit you in on that day at 10 [Person1]:  I would prefer Dr. Smith. [Person2]:  You can see the doctor of your choice then, and we will see you at your scheduled appointment time.
[Person1]:  Good afternoon Sir, may I please see your passport and reservation? [Person2]:  Here you go. [Person1]:  I'm sorry sir, this flight has been cancelled due to some mechanical problems. [Person2]:  Cancelled! So what am I supposed to do now? [Person1]:  We apologize for any inconveniences that may be caused by this. If your flight is urgent, I can put you on a waiting list for another flight this evening, but it's on a first come first served basis, so there is no guarantee that you will be able to take that flight. [Person2]:  What's my other option? [Person1]:  Well, If you can wait until tomorrow, we will put you up in a hotel for today and you can take scheduled flight for tomorrow morning. [Person2]:  That's fine. I'll do that then. [Person1]:  Thank you for your understanding sir. I will book your flight now.
[Person1]:  Good afternoon, Mrs. White. [Person2]:  Good afternoon, Mr. Black. Haven't seen you for a long time. Can I help you? [Person1]:  Can I see Mr. Cooper, your manager now?

[Person1]:  Thanks a lot, Mrs. White. [Person2]:  You are welcome.
[Person1]:  Hi, Mary, you're back! How was New York? [Person2]:  Great! Have you ever been there? [Person1]:  No. [Person2]:  I think it's probably my favorite city. [Person1]:  Really? What's so great about it? I heard it was quite dirty. [Person2]:  In some parts, maybe. But there's just so much going on, the theaters, restaurants, shops and museums. They make London and Paris like country towns. The only problem was the weather. It was freezing. [Person1]:  What a shame!
[Person1]:  Hello, what can I do for you today? [Person2]:  Well, I'Ve got a terrible stomach-ache and I keep needing the toilet. [Person1]:  I see. Well, with those symptoms maybe you'Ve got food poisoning. What have you eaten recently? [Person2]:  Well, I went to a seafood restaurant last night and I ate lots of oysters. [Person1]:  Hmm. It may be those then, especially if they were raw. Well, I'll give you these tablets and you should feel fine by tomorrow. [Person2]:  Ok. Thank you very much.
[Person1]:  How did you like the dishes, Sir? [Person2]:  Delicious. Everything was excellent here. Thank you! [Person1]:  Do you want some coffee, tea, sir? [Person2]:  No. thanks, I'm fine.

[Person2]:  Sure, good night.
[Person1]:  Pardon me. Please speak a little louder.  [Person2]:  I said please stop by the entrance of EVA Air at the Arrival Terminal.  [Person1]:  Sure. What else can I do for you?  [Person2]:  Oh, no. That's it. Nice to chat with you. Have a good day.  [Person1]:  Thanks a lot. We arrived at Kaohsiung International Airport. 
[Person1]:  Are you going to helen's birthday party on Friday evening? [Person2]:  I wouldn't miss it for the world! It's sure to be fun. She's invited a lot of people. Do you think everyone will be able to get into her house? [Person1]:  If everyone turned up, it would be a squeeze. But a few people said that they couldn't go. So I think it should be OK? [Person2]:  Are you taking anything? [Person1]:  I'Ve got her a birthday present and I'll take a bottle fo wine too. [Person2]:  That's a good idea. She told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks. I think it's going to be a noisy party. I hope her neighbors don't mind too much. [Person1]:  Helen gets on very well with her neighbors. I wouldn't be surprised if they went to the party too. [Person2]:  I'm really looking forward to it. This party is going to be a blast! [Person1]:  Well, don't be late. I'll see you on Friday at helen's.
[Person1]:  Mary, I heard you moved again.  [Person2]:  Yeah. I could not stand living here. There is always much noise in the neighborhood.  [Person1]:  You mean noise? How could it be?  [Person2]:  You know, on weekends when we wanted to have late rise in the morning, our neighbour started to raise Cain. 
[Person1]:  Very glad to know something about you, then what are you going to do when you finish.  [Person2]:  Oh, I'll go to shanghai to practice there.  [Person1]:  That's a good idea. It must be easy to find a job in shanghai.  [Person2]:  I think so, you know there is a great deal of opportunity for business there.  [Person1]:  And English is very useful in your job.  [Person2]:  I think it will be very useful in many ways. Beside, shanghai is an important trade center, not only in China, but also in the world, English is useful in almost all walks of life.  [Person1]:  You will be a very promising one.  [Person2]:  That's my wish. 
[Person1]:  Isabel, how many people work for Rolls Royce? [Person2]:  Rolls Royce Group is a big company. But our office here in France is small, only four people, two directores from Germany, one engineer and myself. [Person1]:  So what is a typical day? How much time do you spend on the telephone and the email? [Person2]:  Well, first of all, I make myself a big cup of coffee. Then the telephone and daily affairs. OK, it's not too bad. But I have a lot of emails to write and read. So this may be takes around 75% to 80% of my time. [Person1]:  How many hours per week do you work? [Person2]:  In France, we have a 35 hour working week now. So I start to work at 9 [Person1]:  Do you like your job? [Person2]:  I do like my job. I like working for a British company and I feel like a member of the team rather than just a secretary. It's a real pleasure to come here every day.
[Person1]:  OK, I got my vacation early this year, so as soon as school's out the first of June we have 2 weeks to have fun. We've talked about this before, and have chosen 2 possibilities. A trip across Canada or explore Florida, which will it be? [Person2]:  I'd like to go to Florida. I've always wanted to visit Orlando. [Person1]:  We should get on the internet and check flight schedules as soon as possible. I remember a ticket costs $500. They may still have that promotion where a second person flies for half price. That means the four of us can go for the cost of 3. [Person2]:  Orlando here we come, but we won't spend the whole 2 weeks there, will we? I heard Saint Augustine was cool and there's Daytona Beach, where you can drive on the beach. [Person1]:  Your mother and I will take care of the driving and make hotel reservations. So you and Tim will plan the sightseeing. Is that a deal? [Person2]:  Yeah, great. [Person1]:  Only one rule, each person gets to take one suitcase. [Person2]:  But I have a lot of clothes I want to take. [Person1]:  I'll help you pack.
[Person1]:  Hello George. I wanted to speak to you yesterday, but you weren't at your usual place for lunch. [Person2]:  No, I had a free day from the newspaper office because I worked so much overtime last week. [Person1]:  Oh, I see. You had a holiday. [Person2]:  Well, I stayed at home and looked after the baby. [Person1]:  What? You took care of the baby? Whose baby? [Person2]:  Oh, it was my sister's baby. She wanted to go shopping in the morning, so I stayed at home and did a lot of things. [Person1]:  Oh? [Person2]:  Yes, I mended my radio, washed the shirt and some socks and cleaned out the drawers of my desk. [Person1]:  I don't call that a holiday. I wanted to ask you to a concert last night, the one at the Tom Hall, near where we live.
[Person1]:  Janice how much do you pay for insurance? [Person2]:  Which kind?I have many kinds of insurance. There's car insurance, home insurance, life insurance. [Person1]:  Ah, car insurance? [Person2]:  Let me see. I pay $100 a month. [Person1]:  Wow, that's cheap. I pay twice that much. [Person2]:  Well, there are a couple of good reasons for that. For one men always cost more to insure than women. [Person1]:  What? How can you say that? [Person2]:  Well, if you look at the number of car accidents in the US that cost insurance companies a lot of money. Most of them are caused by men. [Person1]:  You're saying that I'm paying too much money because what other guys are doing wrong. [Person2]:  Exactly. [Person1]:  But I'm a great driver. [Person2]:  Really? How many accidents have you been in this past year? [Person1]:  I don't know. 3 or 4 I guess? But only one of them was my fault. OK. It may be 2 of them. [Person2]:  Right. Do you know how many I've been in over that same period? [Person1]:  Let me guess. 0. [Person2]:  Bingo. [Person1]:  So that's the real reason why your insurance is so low. You don't drive enough. [Person2]:  I think you missed the point.
[Person1]:  How many people are there in your family? [Person2]:  Five. My father, mother, brother, sister-in-law and me. [Person1]:  Is your brother older or younger than you? [Person2]:  He is five years older than me, He got married last Sunday. My brother and my sister-in-law are the same age.
[Person1]:  Tom, you're my good friend, right? [Person2]:  Sure. What's the matter with you? [Person1]:  The exam! The terrible exam! I'm not ready yet. Can you tell me how to get good marks? [Person2]:  Don't be so nervous! Relax! First, sleep early at night. Second, study two hours a day after school. Third, don't tire yourself out, but don't be lazy. Will that help? [Person1]:  Yes, thank you.
[Person1]:  So, are we all ready to go? [Person2]:  Yup, I think so. The car's packed. we have munchies and music, and the map's in the car. [Person1]:  Did you get the camera? [Person2]:  Got it! Did you fill up the tank? [Person1]:  Yup, it's all set. [Person2]:  You're sure we're not forgetting anything? [Person1]:  I'm sure. . . we'Ve got all our bases covered. [Person2]:  Well. let's get going then! I love road trips! [Person1]:  Um. . . do you think we can make a pit stop? [Person2]:  But we'Ve only been on the road for ten minutes. [Person1]:  I know, but I forgot to go to the bathroom before we left.
[Person1]:  I'm afraid I've a complaint to make, which is about the goods we ordered last week. [Person2]:  What is it? [Person1]:  I will explain the problem briefly. We found in the examination that 35 % of the goods have damaged. [Person2]:  Really? That's something unexpected. You see, all our exports are strictly inspected before shipment. The goods were in perfect condition when they left the port. [Person1]:  Here's the survey report issued by the China Commodity Inspection Bureau. According to the report, the damage was caused by poor packing. Our surveyors also discovered some cracks on the surface of a number of other cases. [Person2]:  Our goods are well-examined before shipment. I'm afraid the losses must have occurred on route. [Person1]:  Please look into the matter and solve the problem immediately. [Person2]:  We will check with the parties concerned right away.
[Person1]:  Oh dear, Miss, you are soaked! Wow, it's really raining heavily outside. [Person2]:  Yes, it sure is. I had to run here from work! I need to rush as I'm on my lunch break. [Person1]:  Well please, why don't you go ahead of me in line? I'm in no hurry. [Person2]:  Oh, that's so nice of you! Thank you very much. [Person1]:  My pleasure Miss. Actually, could you recommend what to eat here? I've never been here before. [Person2]:  Sure. Well, the avocado sandwich is delicious, and it's the healthiest thing on the menu. Personally, I think the beef salad is the tastiest choice. I usually get that. Also, the milkshakes are the best milkshakes in town! [Person1]:  Well, thanks for the suggestions. [Person2]:  Oh, don't mention it.
[Person1]:  Good morning, how have you been doing? [Person2]:  I haven't been able to take a deep breath lately, and I need to know why. [Person1]:  Have you had any type of bug lately? [Person2]:  No, I'Ve been feeling fairly good most of the time. It just is hard to breathe. [Person1]:  Has anyone ever told you that you have allergies? [Person2]:  No one has ever checked me for allergies. [Person1]:  Does this happen more when you are under stress? [Person2]:  When the weather gets really cold, it gets worse. [Person1]:  I am going to refer you to a pulmonary specialist who can run tests on you for asthma. [Person2]:  Thank you for pursuing this. I appreciate your help.
[Person1]:  Excuse me. Have you been waiting long? [Person2]:  Um...About ten minutes. [Person1]:  Did you notice whether the No. 7 bus has gone by? [Person2]:  Not while I was standing here. I'm waiting for the No. 7 myself. [Person1]:  Good. Hot today, isn't it? [Person2]:  Oh, yes, it is. I wish that it would rain and cool off. [Person1]:  Me too. This is unusual for March. I don't remember it's ever been so hot and dry in March before. [Person2]:  You were born in Florida then. [Person1]:  No. I was born in New York. But I've lived here for ten years now. [Person2]:  My mother and I have just moved here from Indiana. [Person1]:  Pretty cold in Indiana, isn't it? [Person2]:  Oh, yes. That's why we moved. But we didn't know that it would be so hot here. We should have gone to California. Do you think we've missed the bus? I've been here for 20 minutes already. [Person1]:  Don't worry. It never comes exactly on the half hour like it should.
[Person1]:  good morning!  [Person2]:  good morning, Gav! Did you sleep well last night?  [Person1]:  I slept like a baby. I fell asleep right away last night, didn't wake up once, and didn't have nay nightmares!  [Person2]:  that's great news! You look much more relaxed than you did yesterday.  [Person1]:  I feel much better, but I'm still worried about something.  [Person2]:  what's that?  [Person1]:  well, I have to drive to school for a meeting this morning, and I'm going to end up getting stuck in rush-hour traffic.  [Person2]:  that's annoying, but nothing to worry about.  [Person1]:  for me, traffic jams are quite stressful, because I'm pretty impatient. How can I prevent myself from getting stressed if I get stuck in a traffic jam?  [Person2]:  just btrathe deeply when you feel yourself getting upset.  [Person1]:  Ok, I'll try that.  [Person2]:  is there anything else bothering you?  [Person1]:  just one more thing. A school called me this morning to see if I could teach a few classes this weekend and I don't know what to do.  [Person2]:  do you have any other plans this weekend?  [Person1]:  I'm supposed to work on a paper that'd due on Monday.  [Person2]:  try not to take on more than you can handle.  [Person1]:  you're right. I probably should just work on my paper. Thanks! 
[Person1]:  This is tough to say, Jordan, but I think we should break up.  [Person2]:  Are you serious?  [Person1]:  Yes, I mean it.  [Person2]:  But why? Did I do anything wrong?  [Person1]:  No, we are just too different. This isn't working.  [Person2]:  Hey, come on. It's too early to say that. We can fix things.  [Person1]:  I have thought about it for a while. I think it's time to move on for both of us.  [Person2]:  But I still love you.  [Person1]:  I'm sorry.  [Person2]:  I knew this would happen some day...  [Person1]:  Then why didn't you talk to me?  [Person2]:  Well. It's not all my fault, Anna...  [Person1]:  I don't want to argue with you anymore. This is going to be tough, but Let's try and be friends.  [Person2]:  I would like that Anna, but I think I'll need a little space for a bit.  [Person1]:  I think we'll be better off if we are apart.  [Person2]:  Shall we keep pur friendship?  [Person1]:  Sure, let's just be friends. 
[Person1]:  Excuse me. Do you study Chinese at the university here?  [Person2]:  Yes, I do. But my characters are very bad.  [Person1]:  It takes a long time to learn Chinese writing.  [Person2]:  Are you Chinese?  [Person1]:  Yes, I am. I am from Taiwan. I came here to study political science.  [Person2]:  How do you like it?  [Person1]:  I like it so far. But my English still needs work.  [Person2]:  I want to study Mandarin and international relations.  [Person1]:  Does the Chinese department here teach regular characters or simplified characters?  [Person2]:  They teach regular characters.  [Person1]:  I see. I'm from Taiwan, so I know regular characters better than simplified.  [Person2]:  You just said your English needs work, yes?  [Person1]:  Yes, that's true. Especially my writing. I think my papers aren't good enough. I make too many grammatical mistakes.  [Person2]:  Well, I am very serious about learning Chinese. But for me the hard part now is pronunciation. You have the four tones in Chinese. It is very hard. Maybe, if you have time, maybe we could do a language exchange.  [Person1]:  You mean you and I?  [Person2]:  Yes, why not? I mean, if you come to this cafe often, maybe we could meet here and practice Chinese and English.  [Person1]:  That sounds like a good idea. How often would you like to do it?  [Person2]:  Let's see. . . My schedule right now is quite busy. But I think I could spend 90 minutes a week in language exchange.  [Person1]:  How would we manage it though? How would we spend the 90 minutes?  [Person2]:  First, we could spend 45 minutes working on your English writing. If you want, I could help you edit your papers. Or we could do English conversation. Whatever you want. And then the next 45 minutes you would help me with my Chinese.  [Person1]:  Would I help you with writing?  [Person2]:  No. For me right now, the important thing is spoken Chinese. I need practice. So you could tutor me in speaking. We could use my textbook, and you could ask me questions. Then you could correct my mistakes.  [Person1]:  I think it sounds like a good system. But when is it convenient to meet?  [Person2]:  Well, today is Monday. Actually, for me Monday at this time would be the best. I am free from now until 11  [Person1]:  Me too. In fact, I'm free until 1  [Person2]:  So if you want to meet at 10  [Person1]:  It sounds good. I will bring the papers I'm working on.  [Person2]:  And I will bring my textbook and a tape recorder. I would like to record some things so I can practice on my own.  [Person1]:  Let me give you my phone number.  [Person2]:  Sure. I'll give you mine too. Then we can call if we have to cancel for some reason. 
[Person1]:  I'm really glad I got a chance to talk to you before you left, Mary. Have a safe trip!  [Person2]:  Thanks. Try not to work too hard while I'm away!  [Person1]:  Yeah, I'll try not to! See you after Christmas.  [Person2]:  Okay-bye! Have a nice Christmas. 
[Person1]:  I need some flowers for my wife. It's her birthday.  [Person2]:  Very well. We have some fresh red roses.  [Person1]:  How much are the roses?  [Person2]:  $20 per dozen.  [Person1]:  That sounds like a good deal.  [Person2]:  Yes, they're on sale today.  [Person1]:  I'll take a dozen.  [Person2]:  Splendid. Will there be anything else?  [Person1]:  No, the roses will be fine.  [Person2]:  I'm sure your wife will love them. 
[Person1]:  Hello, Tom. I haven't seen you for sometime. How are you doing? [Person2]:  Oh, not too bad. I have been busy writing an article [Person1]:  Really? Have you finished it? [Person2]:  Yes, I finished it yesterday. [Person1]:  Congratulations. Are you doing something this evening? [Person2]:  No, nothing important. Why? [Person1]:  Well, do you feel like going to relax yourself? Besides, I like music very much. [Person2]:  Great. I'll meet you at your house at 7 [Person1]:  OK. See you at 7 [Person2]:  Bye.
[Person1]:  Why is the car before us stopping? [Person2]:  What's going on? [Person1]:  Look. Two cars are standing right in the middle of the road and the drivers are shouting rude words to each other. That's why that car stops. [Person2]:  More and more people easily get irritated while driving. [Person1]:  Yes. This is what is called road rage.
[Person1]:  Jenny, are you having a good time? [Person2]:  Yes, of course. This is a really wonderful party with interesting people and great food. [Person1]:  I'm glad you are enjoying yourself. [Person2]:  Thank you for the invitation. [Person1]:  It's my pleasure. Can I get you another glass of champagne? [Person2]:  Yes, I'd love another glass. You're a wonderful host. Thank you for everything. [Person1]:  It's my pleasure having you here.
[Person1]:  Are you new to this school? [Person2]:  Yes, I'm new. [Person1]:  Is this your first year in college? [Person2]:  I transferred from another school. [Person1]:  Where did you transfer from? [Person2]:  I was at PCC before. [Person1]:  Why did you transfer? [Person2]:  I was going to go here first, but my grades weren't good enough. [Person1]:  Did you like it at PCC? [Person2]:  PCC is an incredible school. [Person1]:  Well, I wish you luck here. [Person2]:  I'm sure I'll like it here.

[Person1]:  If you don't mind, Mr. Smith, please go to counter number six to queue up and wait for the service. [Person2]:  OK! Thank you. [Person1]:  My pleasure.
[Person1]:  Have you ever noticed that serious pollution in modern cities goes from bad to worse? [Person2]:  You said it. We'er breathing poisonous air every day. [Person1]:  I think it's time for the government to take strong action. And people should try to protect environment. [Person2]:  I absolutely agree with you.
[Person1]:  I cannot ignore her suggestion. In fact I always value her suggestion. [Person2]:  I know. Maybe you will get the air if you go against her. [Person1]:  Well, it takes two to make a happy marriage. [Person2]:  And it takes two to make an agreement too. You have no guts, I am afraid.
[Person1]:  Hey Ted, I saw this ad in the paper. You should take a look. [Person2]:  What is it? [Person1]:  It's for a job. It looks perfect for you. [Person2]:  Let's see. . .

[Person1]:  You know who won the election, right? [Person2]:  I'm still shocked that Obama was elected. [Person1]:  I couldn't believe it, either. [Person2]:  He just made history. [Person1]:  I hope you voted for him. [Person2]:  Of course I did. Did you? [Person1]:  I made sure to vote for him. [Person2]:  I am really excited about this. [Person1]:  I know how you feel. [Person2]:  Hopefully, he'll change things in our nation. [Person1]:  I know that he will. [Person2]:  I trust him.
[Person1]:  I'Ve just looked over your resume and I must admit I am quite impressed. [Person2]:  Thank you. I'Ve worked pretty hard to be able to list those accomplishments. [Person1]:  You'Ve got plenty of training and experience. I wonder if you could tell me something about your goals. Where do you see yourself ten years from now? [Person2]:  To be honest, I don't plan in that much detail. My goals tend to be general ; I define success according to the job at hand. I see myself advancing as I succeed, but I don't necessarily dwell on [Person1]:  interesting! And how do you feel about decision-making? Are you an independent thinker, or do you depend more on your superior for direction? [Person2]:  That depends a bit on the problem at hand. There are certain situations in which a manager can give a general directive, and expect his employees to know how to take the initiative on the detail [Person1]:  Sounds good. Everyone is taking about teams these days. Can you describe your role as a member of a sales team? [Person2]:  I see myself as an encourager. Of course, sales can be quite competitive and sometimes people in this field have a secret desire for others to fail. In my last job, each representative handled [Person1]:  So, your experience is as impressive in practice as it is on paper.

[Person1]:  Last time I talked about the student services in the college. Today I'd like to talk about the Counselling Services. The College Counselling Service is located in the North Building. The counsellors are Ms. Penny Rawson and Ms. Ann David. I have asked Ms. Rawson to join us today to discuss their role. Ms. Rawson... [Person2]:  Thank you. Both Ann and I are full-time counsellors. Students either come tons on their own or are referred to us by a tutor. We see students individually, run group therapy sessions and courses of sessions as we think necessary. We are here to help with any problems? no matter how great or small, such as homesickness, relationship difficulties, death and separation, sexual problems, undue stress due to work and so on.

[Person1]:  Are you free on the weekend? [Person2]:  I haven't got any plans yet, why? [Person1]:  There is an exhibition of Chinese paintings at the public library. Would you like to go with me? [Person2]:  I'd love to, but when? [Person1]:  How about Saturday morning? It's cooler in the morning and maybe less crowded. [Person2]:  I'm afraid I can not get up early on weekends. I'd prefer Saturday afternoon. Believe me there won't be too many people. [Person1]:  So, shall we meet at 2 [Person2]:  OK, that would be great. I'll be waiting for you at my home.
[Person1]:  not a single email until now? it's already twelve o'clock. I can't believe it!  [Person2]:  can't bear it, right? I've been there before. I'll feel comfortable if no one calls me or sends me text messages, like there is something missing.  [Person1]:  yeah, that's right. If no one sends me tect messages, I'll go crazy.  [Person2]:  actually, this is a kind of addiction called 'informania' or 'information overload'.  [Person1]:  addiction? checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction? no way!  [Person2]:  yes, it is. Do you consider a frequent check of your income emails to be an integral part of your working day?  [Person1]:  aboslutely.  [Person2]:  do you have your cell phone with you wherever you go and check text messages and phone calls from time to time?  [Person1]:  yeah, it's a must. Otherwise, I may miss important phone calls and text messages.  [Person2]:  do you open all your IM tools whenever you're using a computer?  [Person1]:  yes. MSN, QQ, Skype, Google Talk, Ali wangwang, everything, so that I'll be in touch with all friends and relatives.  [Person2]:  now I can tell you're definitely addicted to the overflow of information. 
[Person1]:  Could I speak to the apartment manager? [Person2]:  I am the apartment manager. How can I help you? [Person1]:  I wanted to know if that apartment on Main Street is still for rent. [Person2]:  I haven't rented it out yet. Would you like to see it? [Person1]:  Yes, I want to see it. [Person2]:  How about today at 6 p. m. ? [Person1]:  That time is okay with me. [Person2]:  Very good. We'll meet at 6. Do you need directions? [Person1]:  No, thank you. I go by there on my way to work. [Person2]:  If you're interested, you can fill out an application form. [Person1]:  That's a good idea. Do I need to bring anything myself? [Person2]:  No. The only thing I need to see is your driver's license.
[Person1]:  Your house is very old. Does it need redecorating?  [Person2]:  Yes, it really needs redecorating.  [Person1]:  Shall I help you with it?  [Person2]:  I don't suppose you could.  [Person1]:  I have much time. I suppose it can be done.  [Person2]:  I'll be glad if you would. 
[Person1]:  I'm hungry, do you want to go to the burger shop and get something to eat? [Person2]:  Sure, but I need to stop at the drug store first. I need some vitamins. [Person1]:  Why do you want to waste your money? Vitamin pills don't really help you. [Person2]:  Chris, that's not true, actually more people should take them, because they play a vital role in good health. [Person1]:  How? [Person2]:  Many people don't eat healthy food like fruit and vegetables, and don't have a balanced diet, so a vitamin pill can provide some of the missing nutrients. [Person1]:  I know it's better to get all your nutrients from food, not from pills. [Person2]:  That's right, but a lot of people eat like you. [Person1]:  What does that mean? [Person2]:  Your diet consists of fast food and soft drinks, that's not healthy.
[Person1]:  Have you handed in your exercise book, Jack? [Person2]:  I'm sorry, I haven't, Miss Smith. I have already finished the exercise, but I can't find my exercise book anywhere now. [Person1]:  Really? I don't understand why you are always forgetting to hand in your exercise book. You are lying. [Person2]:  Miss Smith, but it is true this time. [Person1]:  I'm really angry with you. If you won't tell me the truth, I'll have to ring up your parents after class.
[Person1]:  Hey, Susie. Can I borrow your car tonight? [Person2]:  No. The last time you borrowed it, you returned it with the gas tank empty. [Person1]:  Did I? I'm sorry, baby. I promise to fill the tank this time. [Person2]:  What do you need it for? [Person1]:  I want to take my mom out to dinner. [Person2]:  And I'm not invited? [Person1]:  You can come if you want. I thought you probably had plans with your friends. [Person2]:  I do. But I'd rather go with you. Don't you think it's time for me to meet your mother? [Person1]:  OK, sure. Just don't expect her to love you right away. She never thinks any girl is good enough for me.

[Person1]:  Hi, David. I haven't seen you for ages. How are you getting along with your work? [Person2]:  Hi, Susan. Not so well as to be expected. I've left my position. I can't bear the rudeness of my boss any longer. [Person1]:  What are you going to do then? [Person2]:  No idea. Anyway, I've got to think about it seriously. And you?

[Person2]:  I just tried to order through your site, and as I told you, the sale wouldn't go through. Can't you give me that discount anyway? [Person1]:  Yeah, I think that would be alright. [Person2]:  I have ordered through you before, and my customer number is 794791. You should have my information and credit card number on file. [Person1]:  Let's see. Oh, yes. [Person2]:  How long will the delivery take? [Person1]:  You should have this by Wednesday, that is the day after tomorrow. [Person2]:  Great.
[Person1]:  Let's go to McDonald's this evening. I'll treat you to dinner. [Person2]:  For what? [Person1]:  Good news! I won First Prize in the singing competition. [Person2]:  First prize! Congratulations! [Person1]:  So I have invited some friends to share my happiness. [Person2]:  What time shall we go there? [Person1]:  Now, it's 5 [Person2]:  Alright. I will drive over there. [Person1]:  Please come to my house and pick me up. My car is being repaired, you know. [Person2]:  OK, See you this evening.
[Person1]:  May I have your order, please? [Person2]:  Yes, I'd like to have a share of steak. [Person1]:  OK. How do you like your steak, do you like it rare, medium or well done? [Person2]:  I like it well-done, please. [Person1]:  Anything else? [Person2]:  One Whisky. [Person1]:  It will be ready right away.
[Person1]:  I've brought this dress back to exchange it. [Person2]:  That's not a problem. Leave it with me, and find something that you like. [Person1]:  I was hoping you'd have something on sale today. [Person2]:  We have nothing on sale today. But we're having a big sale next weekend. [Person1]:  Is the sale going to include dresses? [Person2]:  Everything you can see will be on sale. [Person1]:  I like the sound of that. I'll just come back next weekend. [Person2]:  The savings will be worth the short wait. See you next weekend.
[Person1]:  Hello! I'm sorry to bother you. This is a complimentary fruit tray. Your food will be ready soon. [Person2]:  Wow! It's a fruit sculpture! Your chef is a real artist! [Person1]:  Actually, uh, I made it myself... [Person2]:  You did? Wow! Where did you learn... [Person1]:  Sorry, but I've gotta run. Enjoy your food, and ring the service button if you need anything else!
[Person1]:  Who's singing in your home, Jim? [Person2]:  It's Ellie and her friends. [Person1]:  Who's Ellie? [Person2]:  She's my little niece. It's her birthday. They're singing ' Happy Birthday '. [Person1]:  Oh, I see. how old is she? [Person2]:  She's ten. [Person1]:  I suppose they're playing games. [Person2]:  Oh, yes. Ellie was playing games all day yesterday. By the way, Alice, when's your birthday? [Person1]:  Today. [Person2]:  Today? [Person1]:  Yes. [Person2]:  Well, imagine that! How old are you? [Person1]:  Eighteen. Some friends are having a birthday party for me tonight. Do you want to come? [Person2]:  Very much. What time? [Person1]:  About 6. [Person2]:  I'll be at your house at about five thirty. Happy birthday.
[Person1]:  I need a taxi. [Person2]:  We could easily provide you with a private vehicle, if you'd prefer. [Person1]:  No, the taxi will do. [Person2]:  Perhaps you'd like to take a beautiful limousine. [Person1]:  No, thank you. Taxis and I get along just fine. [Person2]:  No private vehicle, no limo. Got it. Where are you going? [Person1]:  I'm seeing a show at Rockefeller Center. [Person2]:  What time should the taxi be here to pick you up? [Person1]:  I'm ready to go right now. [Person2]:  I'll have a taxi for you momentarily, sir. [Person1]:  Great! As soon as I brush my teeth, I'll be downstairs. [Person2]:  You'll enjoy our new, clean taxis, sir.
[Person1]:  I need some flowers for my wife. It's her birthday. [Person2]:  Very well. We have some fresh red roses. [Person1]:  How much are the roses? [Person2]:  $ 20 per dozen. [Person1]:  That sounds like a good deal. [Person2]:  Yes, they're on sale today. [Person1]:  I'll take a dozen. [Person2]:  Splendid. Will there be anything else? [Person1]:  No, the roses will be fine. [Person2]:  I'm sure your wife will love them.
[Person1]:  Alice, it really was great. I think it was the most interesting thing here. You really should go in. [Person2]:  No, I don't want to. [Person1]:  Really. The special effects are fantastic. You shouldn't be scared. You would really enjoy it. [Person2]:  Sam, I never like Haunted Houses. When I was a kid, I didn't like them. when I was in high school, I didn't like them. when I was in college, I didn't like them as well. So why should I like them now? [Person1]:  But this is maybe one of the best Haunted Houses in North America! It's different. [Person2]:  Why don't we go to the Epcot Center instead? They have displays from many cultures around the world. [Person1]:  I saw that in the guide. It looks like they have different restaurants and different kinds of architecture. Do you want to go? [Person2]:  Yes. That is something I will enjoy. [Person1]:  Alright, let's go then. How many tickets do we have left? [Person2]:  We still have most of the tickets we bought. We can go on a lot of different rides if you like. [Person1]:  I was only interested in the Haunted House and the roller coaster rides. The other rides are for kids. [Person2]:  Let's start walking to the Epcot Center then. According to this map, it is up this pathway here. [Person1]:  Alright, let's go.
[Person1]:  Honey, the house is such a mess! I need you to help me tidy up a bit. My boss and her husband are coming over for dinner and the house needs to be spotless! [Person2]:  I'm in the middle of something right now. I'll be there in a second. [Person1]:  This can't wait! I need your help now! [Person2]:  Alright, alright. I'm coming. [Person1]:  Ok, here's a list of chores we need to get done. I'll do the dishes and get all the groceries for tonight. You can sweep and mop the floors. Oh, and the furniture needs to be dusted. [Person2]:  You know what, I have to pick something up at the mall, so why don't you clean the floors and I'll go to the supermarket and get all the groceries. [Person1]:  Sure that's fine. Here is the list of all the things you need to get. Don't forget anything! And can you pick up a bottle of wine on your way home? [Person2]:  Hey, honey I'm back. Wow, the house looks really good! [Person1]:  Great! Can you set the table? [Person2]:  Just a sec I'm just gonna vacuum this rug real fast. [Person1]:  Wait! Don't turn it on. . .
[Person1]:  Hi, Sue, how's it going? [Person2]:  Oh, Frank. Just fine. How are your classes? [Person1]:  Pretty good. I'm glad this is my last term here, though. [Person2]:  Why is that? I thought you were enjoying school. [Person1]:  I was, but now I'm getting tired of it. I'm ready for the real world. [Person2]:  What are you planning to do when you graduate? [Person1]:  First I want to travel a little, and then get a good job as a computer expert. [Person2]:  Sounds good. I still have three terms to go before I graduate. [Person1]:  You'll make it! Well, see you later.
[Person1]:  Hi, Mr. Bridges. How are you this morning? [Person2]:  Terrible. I'll have a cup of coffee and some toast, please. I do not want sugar in my coffee. [Person1]:  All right. I'm sorry to hear you're not in a good mood. What happened? [Person2]:  Well, my car won't start. I'm already late to work. My dog ran away this morning, and I had to find him. Also, it's raining and my hat is wet. But you know me, I always have bad Mondays. I had a great weekend, but this morning is awful! [Person1]:  I'm going to give you your coffee for free today. You have had such a bad morning! [Person2]:  Wow, thanks! I feel a little bit better already. Are you sure you can give me free coffee? [Person1]:  Yes, it's no problem. We have extra coffee. You come into this coffee shop every day! I hope your day gets better.
[Person1]:  Hi, Steve! [Person2]:  Hi, Jan. I'm planning to go to London by train. Do you want to come with me? [Person1]:  But it'd be cheaper by bus. [Person2]:  I've got a student travel card. You can get cheap train tickets with it. [Person1]:  That sounds good. How much does it cost? [Person2]:  A card for six months is sixteen pounds. [Person1]:  So how do I get one? You need two photographs, one for the card and one for the form. [Person2]:  There's a photo machine in the post office. It gives you four photos for three pounds. [Person1]:  So does the one in the library. But I went to a photographer's studio. It was cheaper. [Person2]:  I don't have to show my passport or my driving licence, do I? [Person1]:  No, Jan, you only need a letter from your college. [Person2]:  OK, I'll ask my teacher for one. [Person1]:  And then you take everything to the tourist office and ask the travel agent. [Person2]:  Great, next time you go to London, I'm coming too! 
[Person1]:  Good morning, Madam. Can I help you? [Person2]:  Eh... Yes, I hope so. I want to go to Edinburgh for the festival, and I'm not too sure of the best way to get there. I've got a car, but it's not in a very good condition. And I was just wondering if you could tell me how long you think it'll take me to drive up there. [Person1]:  Well, if you go there on the motorway, I suppose it's about 8 hours. [Person2]:  8 hours, It's a long way. And considering the patrol prices, it'll be a little too expensive, I suppose. [Person1]:  Well, yes, it probably costs you about 70 pounds depending on your car. [Person2]:  The car is the trouble. Now, what about the coach? I've been told that's fairly reasonable. [Person1]:  Oh, it is. It costs twenty pounds in fact from London to Edinburgh. [Person2]:  Hmm, that's not too bad. [Person1]:  But it takes about ten hours. [Person2]:  Oh, no. What about the train then? [Person1]:  Let me see. It takes five hours ill fact from London to Edinburgh. It costs 62 pounds for a single. [Person2]:  62 pounds for a single ticket. Wow, that's a lot of money. You see, what I'd really like to do is to go by plane. Can you tell me about that? [Person1]:  Yes, of course. Let me see, 78 pounds for a single. But it takes just over an hour. [Person2]:  Really? [Person1]:  Yes, you're there in no time. [Person2]:  Wonderful. That'll be a wonderful start to the holiday. [Person1]:  Shall I book a ticket? [Person2]:  Well, look. I really ought to think about it. Thank you very much for your help. See you later. [Person1]:  See you.
[Person1]:  Okay. May I see your driver's license please? [Person2]:  What? Did I do anything wrong? [Person1]:  License, please. And your car registration. [Person2]:  Oh, yeah. It's here somewhere in the glove compartment. Yeah, here it is. [Person1]:  Sir, did you realize you were speeding in a school zone? [Person2]:  What? No, I didn't, but that's probably because my odometer is broken, I mean, malfunctioning. [Person1]:  Yes, you were going 50 miles per hour in a 20 miles per hour zone. And [What?] AND, you failed to come to a complete stop at the intersection back there. [Person2]:  Rolling stops don't count? [Person1]:  And, one of your break lights is out, [Huh?], you're not wearing a seat belt, AND your driver's license expired six months ago. [Person2]:  And your name is .... Officer Smith? Hey, are you related to the Smiths in town? My wife's cousin's husband (I think his name is Fred) works for the police department here. Or was that the fire department. Anyway, I thought you might be good pals, and you know ... [Person1]:  Hey, are you trying to influence an officer? I could have this car impounded right now because of these infractions. [Person2]:  No, of course not. [Person1]:  Okay, then. Here's your ticket. You can either appear in court to pay the fine or mail it in. Have a nice day. [Person2]:  Do you take cash?
[Person1]:  Good news, I'm not going to have surgery after all. The doctor says I can start working out again soon and maybe play football like before in a few weeks. [Person2]:  That's terrific. It would be great if you could get back in shape in time for the World Cup.
[Person1]:  Lin Yang. It's twelve already. What about having some thing to eat? [Person2]:  Are you hungry? [Person1]:  Well, I am a bit. Aren't you? [Person2]:  Not very. But I don't mind going somewhere for a light meal. [Person1]:  Where shall we go? What about McDonald's? [Person2]:  I'm fed up with French fries and hamburgers. I think we'd better go to the restaurant around the corner. It's a family-type. It serves good food at very reasonable prices. [Person1]:  OK, let's go.
[Person1]:  Hey, Mark, long time no see.  [Person2]:  Julie! It's good to see you again. How have you been?  [Person1]:  Great. I just got back from a week's vacation in Thailand.  [Person2]:  Really? How was it?  [Person1]:  Fantastic! I didn't want to come back.  [Person2]:  I hear the beaches in Thailand are beautiful.  [Person1]:  They are. And not only that the people are friendly, but also the food is delicious, not to mention cheap.  [Person2]:  I do like Thai food. Did you see much of Bangkok?  [Person1]:  Not much. I've go enough city life in Beijing.  [Person2]:  I know what you mean. I could use a vacation myself.  [Person1]:  Hey, wouldn't it be great if we could go to Thailand together sometime?  [Person2]:  Yeah, it sure would. 
[Person1]:  The company is selecting three employees to attend the marketing seminar next month. Did you put your name in for it?  [Person2]:  No, I don't really care too much for seminars... I find them to be either boring or useless. I mean, how much can you really learn in one afternoon seminar? [Person1]:  It's not just about the things that you learn, you know. . . seminars are a really great opportunity to mingle and network with professionals in our industry from all over the nation. You can learn a few things, but more importantly, you rub shoulders with the business leaders and make contacts that could lead to potential sales or patnerships in the future. The social mixers are always more important than the seminars anyway.  [Person2]:  I'm still not too jazzed about going... I feel kind of awkward in those cocktail party situations.  [Person1]:  Well, what if I told you the seminar is going to be held in Hawaii? Does that perk your interest?  [Person2]:  Now you're talking something I am interested in.
[Person1]:  I'm going to go shopping for groceries in a little bit.  [Person2]:  Why, do we need groceries?  [Person1]:  I believe we are all out of food.  [Person2]:  Do you know what to get?  [Person1]:  I don't know what we need.  [Person2]:  Why don't you go and check the refrigerator?  [Person1]:  I would appreciate it if you would do that for me.  [Person2]:  Why don't you just get the basics?  [Person1]:  What do you mean?  [Person2]:  Eggs, milk, bread. Things like that.  [Person1]:  Go make that list.  [Person2]:  Sure, no problem. 
[Person1]:  Helen, I want to have a word with you. [Person2]:  Is it about the appointment yesterday evening? Forget it. It doesn't really matter. [Person1]:  But I must say sorry to you. I didn't mean to break my word. I was about to leave home when my mother suddenly passed out. I took her to the hospital and looked after her all night. It was not until this morning that I remembered my date with you. [Person2]:  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Is she OK now? [Person1]:  She's alright, but I'm terribly sorry to have kept you waiting last night. [Person2]:  I quite understand it's not your fault, but don't forget to call me up next time if you can't come.
[Person1]:  What kind of account do you prefer? Checking account or savings account? [Person2]:  I would like to open a checking account. [Person1]:  Ok, please just fill out this form and show us your ID card. [Person2]:  Here you are.
[Person1]:  I'd like to buy some meat. [Person2]:  What kind would you like today? [Person1]:  I'd like a pound of roast beef. That's my son's favorite sandwich meat. [Person2]:  Really? My daughter likes it, too. OK, that's going to be $5.50. [Person1]:  Perfect. [Person2]:  Anything else? Perhaps some pork? [Person1]:  No, but I do need 3 pounds of chicken breast. My husband wants it for the soup he likes to make. [Person2]:  That costs $4.00 a pound. [Person1]:  Oh, that's expensive. I think he can make the soup with 2 pounds of chicken. I'll make some salad tonight. So we won't need so much food.
[Person1]:  I hope you can help. I've got a bit of a problem with your ATM. [Person2]:  Of course, that's my job. Oh, dear. What's happened? [Person1]:  Well, it's eaten my card! It won't give it back! [Person2]:  I see... calm down, don't worry. May I ask what were you doing when it took your card? [Person1]:  Yes. I was only entering my PIN. I'm terrible at remembering it, I'm so forgetful, you see. [Person2]:  Mmmm... and exactly how many times did you enter it, please? [Person1]:  Maybe three times. As I said, I always forget it. [Person2]:  Ah! Don't worry ; it's just a security measure. If someone uses a card and cannot get the right PIN after three attempts, the bank keeps the card in case it's stolen. Just contact the bank and we'll get it back to you. [Person1]:  Oh, I see. So if I call my branch they can sort everything out for me? [Person2]:  Yes, they'll be happy to help. Believe me, it happens to many people. [Person1]:  I'd better try harder to memorise my PIN in future. Thanks.
[Person1]:  Hmm. Let me try something.Wait. I have a reservation for someone named Sang here. But it's spelled J - A - N - G. It's not spelled J - I - A - N - G. It's for a Mr. C Sang. [Person2]:  Oh, that must be me! Probably they typed the name wrong.My husband's English isn't so good. [Person1]:  Yes, sometimes it happens, Ma'am. That's why it is always good to carry your confirmation number. I'm sorry about the inconvenience. [Person2]:  It's okay. It's probably my husband's fault.Is there a pool in this hotel? [Person1]:  Yes, of course.The pool is open until 10 [Person2]:  Good. [Person1]:  Here is your key. Your room is 379.You can find the elevators just around that corner there, down the hall.Enjoy your stay, Ma'am. [Person2]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  Good morning, young lady. You can call me Ma. Do you see anything you like? [Person2]:  Yes. Many things! I especially love this beautiful quilt. [Person1]:  That quilt was passed down to me from my ma in Holland. [Person2]:  It sounds like a special quilt. Why do you want to sell it? [Person1]:  Well, this home is too big for me now, so I'm moving to an apartment that is much smaller. Therefore, I need to part with a few things. [Person2]:  Oh, I see. Umm, how much do you want for the quilt? [Person1]:  Is fifteen dollars OK?
[Person1]:  Can we choose a time to look at houses together? [Person2]:  Can you do that in the mornings, or would the afternoons be best? [Person1]:  Either way is good for me. [Person2]:  There are a number of open houses this weekend in your area. Would that okay with you? [Person1]:  I can take a little time off of work, or I can go on a weekend, also. [Person2]:  We could meet at the real estate office, or I could pick you up at your home. [Person1]:  I am leaving from work, so maybe I could just meet you at the first house that we will look at. [Person2]:  I can think of five houses that we should look at. It will take most of the day. [Person1]:  I would like to see as many as possible. [Person2]:  When I have confirmed the times with the owners, I will e-mail you our plans for the day.
[Person1]:  Welcome to McDonald's. Can I take your order? [Person2]:  Please give me this extra value meal, a red bean pie, and one order of vegetable salad. [Person1]:  Would you like something to drink? [Person2]:  A cup of hot orange juice. [Person1]:  Will that be it? [Person2]:  Yes, that's all.
[Person1]:  Do you have any other questions? [Person2]:  I want to know about fees. [Person1]:  Which fees? [Person2]:  Overdraft fees. [Person1]:  You will be required to pay a small fee for every time you overdraft. [Person2]:  How much is the fee? [Person1]:  You'll have to pay $ 25 every time you overdraft. [Person2]:  That's a small fee? [Person1]:  It should stop you from overdrafting. [Person2]:  You would think it would, but it most likely won't. [Person1]:  Can I help you with anything else? [Person2]:  That's it for today. Thank you.
[Person1]:  Hello, Anna speaking! [Person2]:  Hey, Anna, this is Jason. [Person1]:  Jason, where have you been hiding lately? You know it's been a long time since your last call. Have you been good? [Person2]:  Yes. How are you, Anna? [Person1]:  I am fine. What have you been doing? [Person2]:  Working. I've been really busy these days. I got a promotion. [Person1]:  That's great, congratulations! [Person2]:  Thanks. I am feeling pretty good about myself too. You know, bigger office, a raise and even an assistant. [Person1]:  That's good. So I guess I'll have to make an appointment to see you. [Person2]:  You are kidding. [Person1]:  How long have you been working there? [Person2]:  A bit over two years. This is a fast-moving company, and seniority isn't the only factor in deciding promotions. [Person1]:  How do you like your new boss? [Person2]:  She is very nice and open-minded. [Person1]:  Much better than the last one, huh? [Person2]:  Yeah. He was a real slave driver. He probably would have loved it if we were robots. [Person1]:  Forget about him. Come over to my house tonight. Let's get drunk. [Person2]:  Good. Tonight 8 o'clock. [Person1]:  8 it is. See you then. [Person2]:  Bye.
[Person1]:  Do you have any experience working with a computer? [Person2]:  Yes. I have been a data entry operator for three years. [Person1]:  What kind of software can you use? [Person2]:  I have working knowledge of Windows and Dos. Actually, I'm quite familiar with both Java and C + + Programming Languages. [Person1]:  Do you have any other computer qualifications? [Person2]:  Yes, I have an ACRE certificate, Bank 2. [Person1]:  Do you know how to use a PC to process the management information? [Person2]:  I'm sorry to say I'm not familiar with processing management information, but I'm sure I could learn quite quickly. It can't be too difficult, and I've got a quick mind. I can handle any problem you give me.
[Person1]:  How are you feeling, Flora? [Person2]:  Much better, thanks. I have been resting all day. Only with television as my companion. In fact, in the whole week the only thing I feel like doing was watching TV. [Person1]:  What did you watch today? [Person2]:  I started with game show this morning, I really enjoy them, and even answered the most of questions correctly. [Person1]:  And next? [Person2]:  At 2 o'clock, I switched to the Channel 6, and watched a terrific movie without commercials. [Person1]:  I know what you mean, there wasn't old action movie next. I think you won't like it. [Person2]:  I want to watch it, but I was already tired by the time it came on. I had a rest instead, then I watched the news at Channel 11. [Person1]:  Anything important happened? [Person2]:  A bank was robbed this afternoon. A reporter on the scene covered the event, the live coverage reproduce the robbery to the live.
[Person1]:  Hello. Gail Willows speaking. [Person2]:  Ms. Willows, hello. This is Daniel calling from IBA Bank. [Person1]:  Hello, Daniel. What can I do for you? [Person2]:  I'm calling to notify you that an Export L / C has arrived for you. [Person1]:  Oh, really? Do you know which company it's from? [Person2]:  Yes, it's from Satura Beds of Tokyo. [Person1]:  Ah, great! I'll send someone over to pick it up. Thanks for calling.
[Person1]:  Good afternoon, Chloe, I'm Doctor Evans. What seems to be the problem? [Person2]:  Hi, Dr. Evans. Thanks for seeing me on such short notice. When I woke up this morning I had a really sore throat and a really bad cough. I think I am coming down with the flu. [Person1]:  Ah I see, yes you do sound rather croaky. Well let's have a look, shall we? Could you please open your mouth and say ah. [Person2]:  Ahhhhhhhh [Person1]:  Good, yes, your tonsils are a little swollen and red. How are your ears, blocked at all? [Person2]:  A little actually. My sinuses are a little blocked up as well-I really feel terrible. [Person1]:  Ok Chloe, can you please breathe in and out slowly for me while I listen to your chest? You really are all bunged up, you don't sound too good at all. Ok, I'm going to set you up with a bunch o [Person2]:  Whoa! So many drugs. . . I hate swallowing pills. Am I able to go to work? [Person1]:  Absolutely not! You are highly contagious! You don't want to infect the rest of your co-workers do you? I recommend staying in bed for at least three days and drinking plenty of fluids so yo [Person2]:  Ok! Would you mind writing me a doctor's note for work, otherwise they may think I am faking it! [Person1]:  Ha-ha, sure not a problem! Here you are. Now off you go and away to bed. If you have any questions just give me a call! Feel better soon and take care. [Person2]:  Thanks doc, bye!

[Person1]:  Yes, you can use your cell phone during the boarding process until the aircraft door is closed. [Person2]:  Thank you. What should I do if I want to phone my family during the flight? [Person1]:  The aircraft is equipped with onboard phones. They do not interfere with the communication and navigation of the aircraft. [Person2]:  So I can use the onboard phone during the flight? [Person1]:  Of course. They will be used at anytime before or during flight.
[Person1]:  Why am I being charged $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered? [Person2]:  Sir, according to your file, you spent Monday evening watching'Titanic. ' [Person1]:  Well, the file is wrong. I was at a great concert that night. [Person2]:  Well, this wouldn't be the first time that a file was wrong. Just a moment, please. [Person1]:  Thank you for taking care of it so quickly. [Person2]:  Sir, when I deleted the $ 10, the program automatically added a $ 2 service charge. [Person1]:  You can't do that! You can't charge me for a mistake that you made! [Person2]:  Sometimes you can't win for losing, sir. [Person1]:  Well, now I've seen it all! What a rip-off this place is! [Person2]:  I don't blame you, sir. Two dollars is a lot of money.
[Person1]:  Hi. May I help you? [Person2]:  Yeah. Um. You see, I need some flowers for my wife, and uh, and, you know, I ... [Person1]:  Let ... Let me guess. You forget your anniversary, and you're trying to make things up, right? [Person2]:  Oh. Yeah, is it that obvious? [Person1]:  Well, yeah. We see men like you all the time that are so involved in their work that they simply forget about us. [Person2]:  Well, in, in ... in this case, it's not like that. [Person1]:  Sure. What do you need? [Person2]:  Well, uh, I'd like to get a dozen roses with some greenery, and a very nice card. [Person1]:  Do you really think a dozen roses is going to cut it? [Person2]:  Well, yeah ... [Person1]:  I mean, if my husband forgot our anniversary, he'd be in the doghouse for sure. [Well ...] You need at least two dozen roses, a dozen balloons, and a romantic evening at an expensive restaurant. [Person2]:  Well, I only have $10, and ... [Person1]:  Ten dollars? Well, that will buy you a single rose and a hamburger at McDonalds, but that's it. [Person2]:  Uh, wait. I actually have twelve dollars and ... wait, hang on, let me see here ... thirty-two cents, so that might be ... [Person1]:  Forget playing golf this weekend. Your wife is way more important. [Person2]:  Oh, no. OH, NO! My wife is out in the parking lot looking for me. Oh. And, and ... she's looking this way. PLEASE, PLEASE. Help me! She'll wring my neck for sure. [Person1]:  Okay, Okay. Uh, let's see. Hum. [PLEASE, PLEASE!]. Well, well, it looks like I can arrange a small bouquet of roses. [Okay.] A couple are a little wilted [Oh, that's okay.], but that's the best I can do. [Oh, yes. Oh, yes. That's fine.] And I can also attach a small card and tie a nice ribbon around the flowers. [Person2]:  Oh, that would be great. You're a lifesaver. I'll put you on my Christmas card list forever. [Person1]:  Okay. Okay. That'll be twelve dollars even. [Person2]:  You're an angel. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, no. [What?] Now, she's parked in front of your store waiting for me. I'm dead meat. Do you have a back door? [Person1]:  No! It looks like you need to face the music and just talk to her. [I can't, I can't.] She'll probably be very understanding after you promise ... [You don't know my wife.] Well, you need to promise to wash the dishes and clean the bathroom for the next six months. Get out there and be a man. [Person2]:  Could you call an ambulance ... just in case? This could get ugly. [Person1]:  Men.
[Person1]:  Can I help you?  [Person2]:  Yes, I need to apply for a parking permit.  [Person1]:  Are you a professor?  [Person2]:  What? Are you kidding? I'm only 22 years old!  [Person1]:  Yes, I am kidding. But don't you know only professors and students with disabilitiescan apply for parking permits?  [Person2]:  Yes, I know. I have a disability. My hip was broken last year. And I can't walk well.  [Person1]:  Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know.  [Person2]:  It's alright. You didn't see me walk to the desk.  [Person1]:  Here is the application form. I also need to see your student ID and your permission letter from the university.  [Person2]:  My permission letter?  [Person1]:  Yes, the letter that certifies you have a disability. And it must certify your disability entitles you to a parking place.  [Person2]:  I was told I should have the letter sent directly to your office.  [Person1]:  Yes. Or you can bring it yourself.  [Person2]:  But I asked them to send it to you directly.  [Person1]:  Let me look in the file then. Maybe we received it.  [Person2]:  My name is Derek Schneider, S - C - H - N - E - I - D - E - R.  [Person1]:  Yes, here it is. Alright. Then I just need your completed application form, and I will be able to process your request.  [Person2]:  Good. I will sit over there and fill out the form. I will give it to you in a few minutes. Oh, by the way, can I apply for any parking lot I want?  [Person1]:  The form has a map on the back. You may specify your top four choices. We will give a spot in the lot that has an opening.  [Person2]:  I see. Thank you.  [Person1]:  You're very welcome. 
[Person1]:  I am looking for a pan.  [Person2]:  No problem. What size would you like?  [Person1]:  A big one would be nice.  [Person2]:  How about this one? It's our biggest, 16' in diameter.  [Person1]:  Oh, yes. I like that one. But it's too heavy.  [Person2]:  Okay, try this one. It's made of aluminum.  [Person1]:  Oh, yes, this is much better. But it has an aluminum handle.  [Person2]:  Here you go. Same pan, but with a state-of-the-art, heat-resistant plastic handle.  [Person1]:  Yes, that's perfect. I'll take it.  [Person2]:  Great. Will that be cash or charge?  [Person1]:  Oh, wait a minute. What about a lid for the pan?  [Person2]:  I'm sorry. I forgot to show you the lid. It comes with the pan. 
[Person1]:  Oh, sweetie. Why are you so excited? [Person2]:  Excuse me? [Person1]:  Sorry, not you, I was talking to my dog Barney. He always goes crazy when he hears the phone ring. [Person2]:  Are you Bill Black? [Person1]:  Yes, what can I do for you? [Person2]:  I'm Jennifer from ABC college. [Person1]:  Oh yes, I'm showing Barney at your pet show. It's going to be lots of fun and kids love Barney. [Person2]:  Didn't he win a competition a few years ago? [Person1]:  He should have come first, but he ended up in the second place. [Person2]:  Second? Wow! That's pretty good. Can I ask what competition that was? [Person1]:  Well, the American Kennel Club Competition. I was so proud of him. [Person2]:  Well, thank you for your information, will put it in the school magazine.
[Person1]:  How about your interview? [Person2]:  They turned me down. [Person1]:  Why? You are so excellent. [Person2]:  I think the only reason is that I was too nervous during the interview and I couldn't express myself the way I wanted to. [Person1]:  What a shame! You should have showed yourself to them! [Person2]:  It doesn't matter. I'll try other companies. [Person1]:  I suggest you hunt for a job on the Internet. [Person2]:  On the Internet? I've never heard of it. [Person1]:  It's very convenient and it has become popular recently. [Person2]:  Is that safe? [Person1]:  Of course, if you log on some standard websites. [Person2]:  Thank you for your advice. I'll have a try.
[Person1]:  I have some great news! I was able to switch to the night shift! [Person2]:  I knew everything would work out for you! [Person1]:  I got to meet the night Anger today too. We got along right from the start. [Person2]:  Wonderful! Do you already have your work schedule? [Person1]:  Not yet, I pick it up tomorrow. [Person2]:  Do you know what you will be doing yet? [Person1]:  Yes, I'll be managing the guys on the dock. [Person2]:  You're so good with people. I think they will like you!
[Person1]:  How is everything going with your girlfriend? [Person2]:  Didn't I tell you? It's over! [Person1]:  Oh, I am sorry to hear that. I did't know that you had split up. What happened? [Person2]:  It was a few things. The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary, but she stood me up! [Person1]:  Really! Did she tell you why she didn't show up? [Person2]:  No, but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her with another man at a club near my home! [Person1]:  What was she thinking? Did you confront her about it when you saw her? [Person2]:  I wanted to, but I knew that if I spoke to her, I'd just blow up at her, so I decided to just go home. I called her later that night, but she didn't answer the phone. [Person1]:  I can't believe she would do that to you. It's so dishonest---and rude! [Person2]:  I know. I still haven't heard from her. The good thing is that I'm so angry with her that I don't feel sad about not having her around. [Person1]:  I bet you she regrets what she's done. You were such a good catch! She really lost out, didn't she? [Person2]:  I guess so. It would be nice to know why she did this though. [Person1]:  I know. It's always nice to have some closure, but I don't think you'll have a problem finding another girlfriend.
[Person1]:  Would you talk to me about taking one of Dr. Miller's classes? [Person2]:  Yes. Have you ever been in one of his classes? [Person1]:  I'm thinking about taking his class next semester. [Person2]:  He was a very easy teacher. Are you thinking of taking a class with him? [Person1]:  I'm not sure because I really need to learn something, but I also worry about grades. [Person2]:  Grades are important, but don't you think that gaining the knowledge is important, too? [Person1]:  I really need to learn this stuff. [Person2]:  He made everything so interesting that the time just flew by. Do you know what I mean? [Person1]:  Yes, that sounds right for me. [Person2]:  Did you know that he came here last year after 10 years in the military? [Person1]:  Yeah, I already knew that. That could be a good thing. [Person2]:  I think you know that you have to make the best decision for you. Enjoy your year!
[Person1]:  We still have one more day to go before we return home. What will we see tomorrow? [Person2]:  No idea. We've enjoyed both the natural scenery and the city sights. What else is there to see? [Person1]:  What about a factory tour? [Person2]:  You mean visit a factory? [Person1]:  Yes. I heard there's a lager motor company nearby which is open to the public every weekend. We can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry. [Person2]:  Good idea! I've always been interested in that. How much is the entrance fee? [Person1]:  I'm not sure, but as far as I know, most factory tours are free. They are sponsored by the company providing the tour. [Person2]:  Really? What do the companies do that for? [Person1]:  I believe most of them think it as good public relations. They can promote their product and make their company better-known. [Person2]:  Oh, ISEE. So factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors. [Person1]:  Exactly. [Person2]:  Do we need an appointment beforehand? [Person1]:  I'll call the tourist information centre to check.
[Person1]:  This sucks. I hate buying lingerie. Okay, just find something and get out of here. Alright, these are fine. Oh, no, don't come over here, don't come over here. [Person2]:  You look a little lost, can I help you? [Person1]:  Um, I'm just having a look around. It's my girlfriend's birthday tomorrow. I'm trying to find her something. [Person2]:  Well, you can't give her granny panties. Have you thought about getting her some sleepwear? We'Ve got these lovely, silky nighties. Or, how about a nice panty-and and-bra set. Look, here's a nice satin push-up bra, and you can choose a few different styles of undies to go with it. [Person1]:  Sure that's fine. This is so awkward. . . what ones do I pick? What size is she? [Person2]:  Well, do you want a thong, some bikini briefs, maybe this nice pair of lacy boy shorts? [Person1]:  Just pick something and get the hell out of here. Um, I'll go with these two. This is mortifying. I just want to get this over with. She better thank me for this. . . [Person2]:  Here you are, sir. I'm sure she'll enjoy them. [Person1]:  Finally! [Person2]:  I'm sorry, sir. I'm going to have to take a look inside your bag.
[Person1]:  Jack, do say good-bye for me to the host. I've got to run. [Person2]:  Why are you in such a hurry? [Person1]:  My old man does not allow me to go back later than 11 p. m. Bye! [Person2]:  Bye!
[Person1]:  We're asking for donations today. [Person2]:  What are you collecting donations for? [Person1]:  We're trying to raise money for the campaigns. [Person2]:  How much are you planning on raising? [Person1]:  As much as possible. [Person2]:  What kind of fundraisers are you doing? [Person1]:  We are going door to door. [Person2]:  You should try actual fundraisers, too. [Person1]:  What else can we do? [Person2]:  Try having a car wash or selling candy. [Person1]:  I didn't think of that. [Person2]:  I know. It'll also help you make more money.
[Person1]:  Are you doing anything special tonight? [Person2]:  I have nothing tonight. Anything I can do for you? [Person1]:  How about going to the movies? It will do you good to get your mind off your work for a while. [Person2]:  That sounds like a good idea. But what is playing? [Person1]:  I've looked up the entertainment section in the newspaper. There are some new films on in town. [Person2]:  Is there anything interesting on? [Person1]:  There is also a new Beijing Opera put on for the first time. I wonder if you are interested. [Person2]:  Why not, of course. [Person1]:  I do not think we have time to go back to the hotel if we want to watch the opera. Let's get something in a nearby restaurant. [Person2]:  OK.
[Person1]:  Do you eat a lot of fruit and vegetables in you country? [Person2]:  Yes, we do. The most popular vegetables are potatoes, carrots, peas, and cauliflower. The most popular fruit are apples, bananas, pears, peaches, grapes, and oranges. Do you like vegetables? [Person1]:  I like them very much. We also eat a lot of vegetables in my country, buy we eat different kinds. [Person2]:  Which kinds of vegetables do people in your country usually eat? [Person1]:  We eat a lot of sweet corn, broccoli and eggplant. [Person2]:  I love eggplant! Unfortunately, it's quite expensive in my country, so I don't eat it often. [Person1]:  Why is it relatively expensive? [Person2]:  Because we don't grow it much in my country. We import a lot from other countries. [Person1]:  I see. We grow a lot of fruit and vegetables in my country. We export a lot of melons, grapes, oranges and lemons. In your country, do you eat corn on the cob? It's very popular in my country. [Person2]:  We eat it in my country too, but I wouldn't say it's very popular. Most people buy frozen sweet corn from their local supermarket. [Person1]:  Do people usually buy frozen vegetables in your country, it's very rare in mine. [Person2]:  A lot of younger people like to buy large packets of mixed frozen vegetables. Peas and sweet corn have been sold frozen in my country for many years. I prefer to buy fresh vegetables.
[Person1]:  Okay Rebecca, well I think you'Ve given me a clear impression of your positive qualities, but let's talk a little bit about your weaknesses. [Person2]:  Okay, well it's always more difficult to describe them isn't it? [Person1]:  Definitely, but if you had to pinpoint one weakness what would it be? [Person2]:  Well as I mentioned before, I do tend to get frustrated if I don't see progress in my work or career. I suppose I'm quite a restless character. My father always taught me to be a high achiever so. [Person1]:  So would you say if things don't go your way at work it could easily get you down? [Person2]:  Well, in a way yes. But I must say that even if I'm not completely happy in my work I always give 110 % I would never shirk my responsibilities. I suppose sometimes I expect too much too soon. [Person1]:  Well, you know journalism is a highly competitive world, so you do need to keep pushing yourself it's true. Okay, well let's move on to talk about the job position here, shall we? [Person2]:  Yes, please.
[Person1]:  I'd like to book a flight ticket for New York, please. [Person2]:  New York. When? [Person1]:  Next Friday, September 5th. [Person2]:  All right. Do you want a single ticket or a return one? [Person1]:  A return one, please. [Person2]:  Would you like to leave it open? [Person1]:  Yes, please. How much is it? [Person2]:  $4,956. [Person1]:  Here is the money. [Person2]:  Here is the ticket, thanks.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, Sara. [Person2]:  Yes? [Person1]:  I have some difficulty in pronouncing some of the words in the text. Could you help me? [Person2]:  Sure. [Person1]:  How do you pronounce this word? [Person2]:  Travel. [Person1]:  Travel. What does 'travel' mean, please? [Person2]:  It means 'go from place to place'. For example, I want very much to travel round the world. [Person1]:  I see. How about this word? [Person2]:  'Explain something' means 'make something clear'. [Person1]:  How do you spell 'clear'? [Person2]:  c-l-e-a-r, clear. If you want to make something clear to others, you explain it. Are you clear? [Person1]:  Yes. You have explained clearly. [Person2]:  That's good.
[Person1]:  Hello?  [Person2]:  Hi Steve. This is Mike. What are you doing?  [Person1]:  Oh, hi. I was just watching TV.  [Person2]:  There's nothing to watch right now.  [Person1]:  I know. I was watching a re-run. I have nothing to do and I was bored.  [Person2]:  Me too. Let's get together and do something.  [Person1]:  I'd like to, but I have to meet my parents in an hour for dinner. How about tomorrow?  [Person2]:  Yeah. Let's plan something tomorrow.  [Person1]:  Did you hear the weather forecast for tomorrow?  [Person2]:  I think it is going to be the same as today. Clear and sunny.  [Person1]:  That's great. We can do something outdoors then.  [Person2]:  Are there any special events going on tomorrow?  [Person1]:  Yeah. I think there's a live outdoor concert by the river tomorrow.  [Person2]:  Oh yeah. I heard about that too. Let's go check it out.  [Person1]:  Do you know what time it starts?  [Person2]:  It starts at one PM.  [Person1]:  Let's meet for lunch at eleven thirty and afterwards, we can head over there.  [Person2]:  Perfect. I'll see you in front of the apartment at eleven thirty. 
[Person1]:  Can I help you, madam?  [Person2]:  Yes, I'm looking for a new winter coat.  [Person1]:  Have you any particular color in mind?  [Person2]:  I don't know really. What's the fashional color this year?  [Person1]:  Red is very popular.  [Person2]:  Good. Red suits me very well. It's a cheerful color, isn't it?  [Person1]:  Yes, madam, I agree. What size are you ?  [Person2]:  Well, I used to be size fourteen, but I've put on a bit of weight recently, so may be sixteen.  [Person1]:  Here you are, madam. All these are sixteens.  [Person2]:  I quite like this one. How much is it?  [Person1]:  It's $180.  [Person2]:  Oh, that's too expensive. Aren't there any cheaper ones?  [Person1]:  These are our cheapest coats, madam.  [Person2]:  Yes, I see. I'll take it. Here's $200.  [Person1]:  Here's your change.  [Person2]:  Thank you. 
[Person1]:  Honey, what do you think love is?  [Person2]:  Love has many meanings; it means different things to different people.  [Person1]:  What's the best way to express love? I mean, really deep love? Person2 [Person1]:  No, I mean real love. Love more beautiful than a spring morning. Love better than a cool drink on a hot day. Real love.  [Person2]:  Then you say you are head over heels in love.  [Person1]:  Honey, I. . .  [Person2]:  Yes? Yes?  [Person1]:  I'm head over heels in love with my car.  [Person2]:  Ah! 
[Person1]:  Shall I pick you up then? [Person2]:  I don't know. The traffic will be really bad at that time. You know what it's like after a concert. I was thinking of catching the train. [Person1]:  Hmm...It will be late. Won't that be a bit dangerous? I'm not busy you know. [Person2]:  That's really kind of you. I've also thought of getting a taxi, but then there's still the traffic to worry about. I think my original idea is the best.
[Person1]:  Hello. [Person2]:  Good morning, sir. Welcome to London Heathrow Airport. Where are you going? [Person1]:  I'm going to Taipei by way of Hong Kong. [Person2]:  Your passport and ticket, please. Will you be checking in any banks, Mr. Lewis? [Person1]:  Just one and I have this carry-on bag. [Person2]:  What kind of seat would you like, Mr. Lewis? [Person1]:  Window, please. [Person2]:  Your flight 923 will board at gate 35. It is 9 o'clock now and boarding will begin in 2 hours 30 minutes before the flight takes off. And here's your boarding pass. Have a good trip, Mr. Lewis. [Person1]:  Thank you. Bye.
[Person1]:  Hello, Tom Wilson's. Can I help you? [Person2]:  Hi. It's Emma Lloyd here. I'm calling about my motorbike. Is it ready to be collected yet? [Person1]:  Can you remind me what's the brand of the bike? [Person2]:  It's a City Zip. It's blue. [Person1]:  Oh yes, we had to order in some parts. But they still haven't arrived yet I'm afraid. [Person2]:  Do you know when the bike will be ready to pick up? [Person1]:  Sorry, I don't know. But our cooler suppliers and find out if they've sent out the spare parts yet. Once the parts are here, we can fix the bike in 2 or 3 days. [Person2]:  OK, I'll give you a call at the end of the week then. [Person1]:  Sure.
[Person1]:  Only one. But I wanted to make sure I'd get it. [Person2]:  Yeah, I really wanted that Chanel bag, too. But just in case you should bid low. [Person1]:  But there are only two more days until the bidding closes! [Person2]:  I bid on a Chanel watch at the last minute, and got it sixty percent off! [Person1]:  Oh... I'm such a newbie. But at least I'm sure I'll get that tennis racket. [Person2]:  Don't count on it, Babe. eBay is always full of surprises. [Person1]:  Well... guess how low the bidding starts on the tennis racket?
[Person1]:  Did you meet the new girl in our sales department. She is taking the place of Maggie during her maternative leave.  [Person2]:  Did they finally fill that post, how come I haven't seen her? She must have not been inducted yet.  [Person1]:  I guess not, They haven't officially introduced her to the whole staff yet, she barely started yesterday.  [Person2]:  Is she just working temporarily? What are they going to do when Maggie comes back from leave.  [Person1]:  If the new girl is competent, maybe they will promote her when that time comes. 
[Person1]:  Were you able to attend Friday night's basketball game? [Person2]:  I was unable to make it. [Person1]:  You should have been there. It was intense. [Person2]:  Is that right. Who ended up winning? [Person1]:  Our team was victorious. [Person2]:  I wish I was free that night. I'm kind of mad that I didn't go. [Person1]:  It was a great game. [Person2]:  What was the score at the end of the game? [Person1]:  Our team won 101-98. [Person2]:  Sounds like it was a close game. [Person1]:  That's the reason it was such a great game. [Person2]:  The next game, I will definitely be there.
[Person1]:  Oh, my God. I can't take it any more. [Person2]:  What's wrong, honey? Take it easy. [Person1]:  I am tired of doing that boring work. I just repeat doing counting everyday. It's so terrible. [Person2]:  Me too. But I think we can do something else for a change. [Person1]:  You know I work with my professional knowledge not passion. Sometimes I don't know what the meaning of working is? [Person2]:  But you did a good job. You always perform the best in our company. [Person1]:  Yes, that's in the past. Maybe I need to go to my psychologist for help. [Person2]:  Perhaps you've just tired and you need a vacation. [Person1]:  I was full of ambitions before. But now I have no aim for my career. [Person2]:  Maybe we should keep on studying to enrich our knowledge and make our life exciting. [Person1]:  That sounds interesting. But I don't know how to do that. [Person2]:  How about a training course? [Person1]:  A training course? That must be costly. [Person2]:  But it's worth it. Maybe it can get us into a good mood and also helps us learn something to use for the future. [Person1]:  OK, let's have a try. [Person2]:  OK.
[Person1]:  We need to figure out how much money we're spending and what we're spending it on. [Person2]:  Why? [Person1]:  Well, I think we could be saving more. [Person2]:  Really, well, o. k. Get the receipts out. [Person1]:  Let's see. We spent $ 700 dollars for our home loan payment, $ 400 on groceries, $ 75 on utilities, $ 250 on gasoline, $ 100 on books, and $ 300 on entertainment last month. [Person2]:  That's $ 1825. [Person1]:  We put $ 500 into the savings account, and $ 750 into our stock account. [Person2]:  $ 3075. Our paychecks our $ 3300, combined. That means we don't have any receipts for $ 225. [Person1]:  Right.
[Person1]:  Hello. 9-1- 1. Can I help you? [Person2]:  I need the police. [Person1]:  What happened? [Person2]:  My neighbor hit my brother on the head. He's bleeding. [Person1]:  Give me your address. [Person2]:  176 Wooden Street East. [Person1]:  All right. The police and an ambulance are on the way. In the meantime, find a clean cloth and press it firmly over the wound. This will slow the bleeding. [Person2]:  I will, but please hurry. [Person1]:  Help will be there in just a few minutes.
[Person1]:  What can I help you with today? [Person2]:  I need to check out this book. [Person1]:  Do you have your library card? [Person2]:  I don't have one. [Person1]:  Would you like to apply for one right now? [Person2]:  That's fine. [Person1]:  I'm going to need you to fill out the application. [Person2]:  All right. All done. [Person1]:  All right, now please sign the back of the card. [Person2]:  Okay. I'Ve signed it. [Person1]:  That's all there is to it. [Person2]:  Great. Now can I check out this book?
[Person1]:  Wake up, Erik, time to rise and shine. [Person2]:  Huh, oh, hi, Jane. I must have fallen asleep while I was reading. [Person1]:  You and everyone else. It looks more like a camp-ground than a library. [Person2]:  Well, the dorm's too noisy to study in, and I guess this place is too quiet. [Person1]:  Have you had any luck finding a topic for your paper? [Person2]:  No. Prof. Grant told us to write about anything in cultural anthropology. For once I wish she hadn't given us so much of a choice. [Person1]:  Well, why not write about the ancient civilizations of Mexico. You seem to be interested in that part of the world. [Person2]:  I am, but there is too much material to cover. I'll be writing forever, and Grant only wants five to seven pages. [Person1]:  So they limit it to one region of Mexico. Say the Yucatan. You'Ve been there and you said it's got lots of interesting relics. [Person2]:  That's not a bad idea. I brought many plenty of books and things back with me last summer. That would be great resource material. Now if I can only remember where I put them.
[Person1]:  Did you hear about car accident on Spring Road yesterday? [Person2]:  Yes, I did. I heard that they took both drivers to hospital. One needed surgery. [Person1]:  Yes. I heard he had a few broken bones too, but that the doctors have set the fractures without any problems. [Person2]:  The second driver was luckier. He had a concussion and needed some stitches for his head wound. [Person1]:  Yes. He was released from hospital yesterday evening. The other man could be there for weeks. [Person2]:  I understand that he's connected to a heart monitor and breathing apparatus. His condition can't be very good. [Person1]:  The hospital announced this morning that his condition is poor but stable. What does that mean? [Person2]:  It means he's really badly injured, but he will almost certainly survive. [Person1]:  His family will be pleased to hear that. They must have been so worried.
[Person1]:  Dad, you've been driving for three hours. Why don't we have a switch? [Person2]:  There're a lot of chuckholes on this old highway. Driving on it is experience-demanding. [Person1]:  Trust me. I've been driving for two years. [Person2]:  Ok. You drive and do be careful.
[Person1]:  I'm hungry, let's order up something to eat. [Person2]:  Ok, maybe we can order a soup and a salad from the restaurant down the street. [Person1]:  I was thinking of getting a hamburger, fries and a chocolate sundae. [Person2]:  You eat too much junk food. That sort of stuff clogs up your arteries and is very high in cholesterol. [Person1]:  Well I never seem to gain weight so I don't mind. [Person2]:  It's not only about getting fat or not, it's about being healthy. You could really have some health problems later on. [Person1]:  How about pizza or maybe some fried chicken! Better yet, let's order some hot dogs! [Person2]:  You are a lost cause.
[Person1]:  Hi, Kerry. Do you follow the news every day? [Person2]:  Sometimes. [Person1]:  How do you follow the news? [Person2]:  Well, here in Japan, mostly on the radio or the internet. [Person1]:  Oh, really? OK. What radio station? [Person2]:  NPR. But on the military station. [Person1]:  OK, and what Internet websites do you listen to? [Person2]:  Well, usually it is just AP news, BBC News or whatever. [Person1]:  OK. How much of the news do you think is true? [Person2]:  I don't know. That's a tough question, because there's so many journalists. The stories made into the papers tend to be accurate, but Unfortunately some people leak information that is untrue to influence public opinion. So you have to consider why that news story is made public. [Person1]:  Yeah, how do most people in the states get news? [Person2]:  I think most people in the states get news from TV and from the main broadcasting stations. The Evening News, sort of thing. [Person1]:  OK, thanks Kerry.
[Person1]:  Glad to see you in your company. [Person2]:  So am I. [Person1]:  We are in the market for machines. What can you offer in this line? [Person2]:  What type do you have in mind exactly? [Person1]:  Well, we are interested in milling machines. [Person2]:  Let me show you some illustrations of the machines we make. Here's our latest catalogue. [Person1]:  May we have a look at them? [Person2]:  Certainly. But they are in the showroom. It's about half an hour's car ride. Are you free now? [Person1]:  I will be free tomorrow afternoon. Suppose we make it, say, three o'clock tomorrow afternoon. Would you manage that? [Person2]:  Yes, I will pick you up at your hotel.
[Person1]:  Good morning. [Person2]:  Good morning. I was wondering if you can help me. I received this notice yesterday afternoon. [Person1]:  Let me see. It's $ 10 for a lost book. [Person2]:  But I'm sure I returned it. [Person1]:  Our records show that you checked it out on September 17 and we have no record of its return. [Person2]:  I remember it was a rainy day and I had to carry it in a plastic bag. [Person1]:  Well, our policy is that, when a book is lost, whoever lost it must pay for it. [Person2]:  I understand. Can we check if the book is here, just in case someone missed it? [Person1]:  Well, I doubt we would make a mistake about this. But you can look on the shelf. [Person2]:  (Pause for two seconds) Aha! Here it is! [Person1]:  Let me see if it is the same copy you borrowed. I'll cheek the number with our records... Well, it is the same copy. We could have missed something. I am awfully sorry. [Person2]:  Don't worry about that.
[Person1]:  Hi, Maria. [Person2]:  Oh! Hi, Dave. Come on in. Take a seat. Would like anything to drink, coffee or tea? [Person1]:  Coffee would be fine. Eh... So how have you been? [Person2]:  Oh, not so bad. And you? [Person1]:  Oh, I'm doing OK. But school has been really busy these days, and I haven't had time to relax. [Person2]:  By the way, what's your major anyway? [Person1]:  Hotel management. [Person2]:  Well, what do you want to do once you graduate? [Person1]:  Eh... I haven't decided for sure. But I think I'd like to work for a hotel or a travel agency in this area. How about you? [Person2]:  Well, when I first started college, I wanted to major in French. But I realized I might have a hard time finding a job using a language. So I switched to computer science. With the right skills, landing a job in the computer industry shouldn't be as difficult. [Person1]:  So do you have a part-time job to support yourself through school? [Person2]:  Well. fortunately for me, I received four-year academic scholarship. That pays for all of my school expenses. [Person1]:  Wow. That's great. [Person2]:  Yeah. How about you? Are you working your way through school? [Person1]:  Yeah, I work three times a week at a restaurant near campus. [Person2]:  Oh, what do you do there? [Person1]:  I'm a cook. [Person2]:  How do you like your job? [Person1]:  It's OK. The other guys are friendly and the pay isn't bad.
[Person1]:  We would be interested in having you join us, Mrs. Sharp. [Person2]:  Thank you. I have done this knid of work before. [Person1]:  I know, and that's probably the reason you've been employed. Do you prefer part-time or full-time employment? [Person2]:  Part-time. [Person1]:  OK. Some people choose part-time jobs because they want to do something else besides work, such as reading novels or playing sports. But they will not get any other benefits besides the wages. [Person2]:  I don't care about that. May I ask you if I can decide the hours I would work? [Person1]:  I can only give you the choice from 7 [Person2]:  Then I'd prefer to work in the morning because I have to prepare dinner for my children. [Person1]:  OK, Mrs. Sharp. Just sign your name on this sheet of paper. You may start next week. Mrs. Clarkson has got something ready for you--a blackboard, some chalk, and a tape recorder. She'll show you around later. [Person2]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  who are you writing a letter to?  [Person2]:  I'm just responding to Sue's letter. Do you want to help?  [Person1]:  OK. I guess I could add something. Tell them that I send my love.  [Person2]:  that's kind of boring. Don't you want to tell them anything else?  [Person1]:  well, maybe you could tell them about my promotion.  [Person2]:  you've been promoted? when did that happen?  [Person1]:  just today. I guess I forgot to mention it.  [Person2]:  congratulations! That's really exciting! Let's get out a bottle of wine to celebrate!  [Person1]:  shouldn't we finish writing this letter first?  [Person2]:  ah. That can wait. Your promotion is the best news I've heard in a long time!  [Person1]:  it is good news, but it looked like you were almost finished. We might as well just sign off.  [Person2]:  ok, you're right. I'll just tell them how pround I am of you for getting a promotion and then I'll thank Sue for her kind letter.  [Person1]:  I guess you can write that I'm looking forward to seeing them in June.  [Person2]:  that's thoughtful of you.  [Person1]:  and also thank them from the botttom of my heart for the Christmas package they sent us.  [Person2]:  that's right! I almost forgot about that.  [Person1]:  what would you do without me?  [Person2]:  we do balance each other out well. I guess we were really made for each other! 
[Person1]:  May I see a hat , please?  [Person2]:  What size do you take?  [Person1]:  I'm sorry. I don't know.  [Person2]:  I'll measure you. . . You take size 6. What colour hat would you like?  [Person1]:  Brown, please.  [Person2]:  Here are some nice brown hats. Try this hat on. It's a very good one.  [Person1]:  Yes, I like this one. It goes very well with my coat. How much is it?  [Person2]:  It's $ 9. 95. Do you want me to put it in a box? 
[Person1]:  Hello, Mike. It's Caroline here. I've just been reading a paper and I found a job advertised in it that I think will be perfect for you. [Person2]:  Oh, what's the job? [Person1]:  The company want a marketing manager. Isn't that the kind of thing you're looking for? [Person2]:  Yes. Does it say what kind of job it is? [Person1]:  The main thing seems to be that you'll be in charge of sales planning. [Person2]:  Well, what sort of people are they looking for? I suppose they want me to have an MBA. [Person1]:  There is nothing about that, but it does say that they are looking for someone who can speak foreign languages. Well, that's OK for you, because you've lived abroad and you can speak German, right? [Person2]:  Yes, when can I apply for the job? [Person1]:  The third of July is the closing date, so you've got exactly a month. Do you want me to email you the advert, so you can see it yourself? [Person2]:  Yes, that would be great. [Person1]:  OK, I'll do that now.
[Person1]:  This is a wonderful pie. Is it homemade? [Person2]:  It is, but I didn't make it. Jack did. [Person1]:  I didn't know your husband cooked. [Person2]:  Every week he makes something wonderful. He makes great fresh bread. Sometimes we give some to our neighbors. [Person1]:  What else does your amazing husband do? [Person2]:  He makes dinner every night. [Person1]:  Really? I don't even know how to fry an egg. [Person2]:  Jack even does the washing. I spend longer hours traveling from my home to my office and spend fewer hours at home. So he doesn't mind. [Person1]:  Yes, our company is a little far from your home. Who does the cleaning? [Person2]:  We both do. That way it only takes a small part of Saturday.
[Person1]:  It says here that you graduated from Beijing Normal University with a major in English Language and Literature. [Person2]:  Right. Then you may think that I am not fit for this job according to my educational background. [Person1]:  Yes. [Person2]:  But I want to be a tour guide very much because I like traveling and meeting various kinds of people. So I took an evening course at the Tourism School of Beijing after graduation and I have gotten a qualification certificate. [Person1]:  So you must be an extravert? [Person2]:  Yes, I always enjoy being with a group of people and chatting with them. [Person1]:  What do you think are the responsibilities of a tourist guide? [Person2]:  A tourist guide must be responsible for arranging and coordinating tour activities, and offering service of transportation, accommodation, sightseeing, shopping and entertainment. [Person1]:  Don't you consider it a hard work? [Person2]:  Hard but interesting, I think. [Person1]:  Have you any experience as a tourist guide? [Person2]:  Yes, I usually guided foreign tourists around Beijing when I was in University. [Person1]:  Have you ever learned any other foreign languages other than English? [Person2]:  Yes, I have learned a little French and Japanese as well.
[Person1]:  Hi Melissa, are you going home this weekend? [Person2]:  No, not this weekend. I have too much work to do. [Person1]:  Where do your parents live? [Person2]:  My father lives in Washington DC. [Person1]:  How about your mother? [Person2]:  My mother died two years ago. [Person1]:  Oh, I am sorry to hear that. Is your father still working? [Person2]:  No, he's retired. [Person1]:  Do you have any family here? [Person2]:  Yes, two of my cousins live here and my aunt and uncle live about 30 miles from here. [Person1]:  Do you have any brothers or sisters? [Person2]:  Yes, I have two brothers who live in New York and a sister who lives in Boston. [Person1]:  Do you see them a lot? [Person2]:  Not as much as I'd like to. Usually just on holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas.
[Person1]:  Hi! Can I help you? [Person2]:  Yes. We have reservations. [Person1]:  What's your name, sir? [Person2]:  Jack Bates. [Person1]:  Yes, sir. We have your reservation. Could you fill out these forms, please? [Person2]:  The reservation was for a double for three nights, wasn't it? [Person1]:  Yes, sir. That's correct. How will you pay your bill, cash or credit card? [Person2]:  Credit card. [Person1]:  Thank you, sir. You'll be staying in room 1910. Here are your keys. The bellhop will take your luggage upstairs. Have a nice stay, sir. [Person2]:  Thanks.
[Person1]:  I'd like to have this cashed, please. [Person2]:  Please put your name and address here. May I see your passport. [Person1]:  Yes. [Person2]:  How would you like it? [Person1]:  Ten hundreds and Ten Twenties and the rest of small changes please. [Person2]:  Ok, here you are.
[Person1]:  Can I ask for leave this afternoon? [Person2]:  What is the problem? [Person1]:  I had a headache this morning. I didn't pay attention to it. I thought probably it is because I didn't sleep well. But now it is getting worse and worse. I feel quite dizzy now and my eyes are somehow very light-sensitive. Maybe it is the migrated. [Person2]:  It is ok. You look really pale and red eyes. I suggest you go home immediately and have a good rest. [Person1]:  Thank you very much. I am sure good rest will do indeed. I don't have this too often.
[Person1]:  What happened? I've been waiting for 2 hours. [Person2]:  Sorry, we landed on time, but I couldn't exit the airplane with everyone else. [Person1]:  Why not? [Person2]:  Security stopped me. Just before we landed, a little girl dropped her backpack in my seat when I went to brush my teeth. I guess the flight attendant couldn't figure out whose it was and called security. [Person1]:  So you landed at 7 [Person2]:  Well, they let me go after an hour and a half, but I had to get my luggage. Oh, and there was no food on the flight either. [Person1]:  You must be starving! Can I take you to a restaurant? [Person2]:  Thanks.
[Person1]:  Hello, this is David. [Person2]:  Hi David, this is Marge. Can you meet me after work for a few minutes? [Person1]:  Sure! How about the coffee shop right across the street from my office? [Person2]:  That will work. [Person1]:  Does five thirty work for you? [Person2]:  That will be fine. What I have to show you will only take a few minutes of your time. [Person1]:  Is it the plans for my new house? [Person2]:  Yes. I just need to double check a few details with you.
[Person1]:  Evening, table for three, please. [Person2]:  Do you have reservations? [Person1]:  Yes, I do. I have made reservations under the name of Wang. [Person2]:  Very Wang sir, smoking or no smoking? [Person1]:  No smoking, please. Could we have table by the window? [Person2]:  Of course, this way please.
[Person1]:  Welcome to IBA. How can I help you? [Person2]:  You called yesterday to tell me that our funds under the L / C had arrived? It's Ming Cha Legal Services. [Person1]:  Oh, yes. I remember. You must be Mr. Xie. It's nice to put a face to a voice. [Person2]:  Yes, it sure is. The L / C number is JD185649000023. [Person1]:  JD185649000023? Yes, found it. 175, 000 Euros, is that correct? JD185649000023? [Person2]:  Correct. Could I convert that into RIB? [Person1]:  Yes, you can. Just wait a moment and I'll do that for you now. [Person2]:  That's fine, thanks.
[Person1]:  Here's my passport. I'm a visiting scholar. [Person2]:  Do you have anything to declare? [Person1]:  No, these are all my personal effects. [Person2]:  What's in the bag? Would you mind opening the bag? [Person1]:  Not at all. I don't know what's dutiable. Do I have to pay duty on things for my own use? [Person2]:  NO. You don't have to pay duty on personal belongings. [Person1]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  Hello, can I get a taxi? We're just outside the city limits. [Person2]:  No problem, ma'am, where exactly are you going? There is an extra charge for anything over 20 kilometers. [Person1]:  The Roxy Club downtown, there are 6 of us, though. Do you have any bigger cars so we don't need to take two taxis? [Person2]:  Yes, on the weekends, we do. However, it's $3 more to have the bigger car sent you away. [Person1]:  That will be fine, and we should be well under the 20 kilometers to our destination. [Person2]:  Yes, I can see that, would you like us to send that for you now? [Person1]:  Yes, please.
[Person1]:  what's the cheapest way to go there? [Person2]:  By subway. [Person1]:  Oh, is that right? Is there a subway station near here? [Person2]:  Yes. There's one on the other side of the building. [Person1]:  Good. Can I walk through this building? [Person2]:  I'm afraid you can't. you'Ve to go out there and walk around. [Person1]:  I see. Thank you.
[Person1]:  Miss Maggie? [Person2]:  Yes, sir? [Person1]:  Did you speak to Mr. Robinson? [Person2]:  Yes, I did. I asked him to call later. He said he would call again in about an hour. [Person1]:  That's fine. By the way, has Charlie photocopied my report yet? I need it this afternoon. [Person2]:  Not yet. I told him to finish it by 11 this morning. [Person1]:  Good. Did you tell Miss Martin not to call her boyfriend from here? [Person2]:  Oh, yes. I told her not to use the office phone for personal calls. She won't do it again. [Person1]:  I hope she won't. Her boyfriend lives in France! [Person2]:  I'm sure she won't. Is there anything else, Mr. French? [Person1]:  Hmm. Could you bring me a cup of tea? [Person2]:  Sure.
[Person1]:  It's exciting just to think about it. It will be my first trip to Italy, but I may have trouble finding my way around when I'm there. [Person2]:  Don't worry about that. Just give me a call when you arrive. I'll show you the way around.
[Person1]:  I've received your letter of application and I see your current job is as a sales assistant at Ray Stones book shop? Why have you applied for this position? [Person2]:  Well, I've really enjoyed my work at Ray Stones. I've always been interested in books and usually the customers are really nice. And I like trying to find books for them. [Person1]:  So why do you want to leave? [Person2]:  Because it's quite a small independent book shop. But EI books is a much bigger company. I read on your website. You have over 50 branches now and you're still growing, and I see you also have a website where people can order books. [Person1]:  Well, it's true that we've grown quickly in recent years and it's nice to see you found out about the company. So would you describe yourself as ambitious? [Person2]:  Um... I don't think so, but I'd like to be successful. [Person1]:  And what are some of your main strengths? [Person2]:  Ah, I work hard and I enjoy working with other people and uh, I can solve problems. You can always put your trust in me. [Person1]:  That's good.
[Person1]:  This is a nice restaurant, isn't it?  [Person2]:  It's wonderful. The view is simply beautiful. How did you find this restaurant?  [Person1]:  Well, I'm a sophisticated traveler. I know all the great restaurants in the world.  [Person2]:  Sophisticated traveler, huh? I bet you picked the first restaurant you found in the guidebook.  [Person1]:  I'll pretend I didn't hear that. How's the fish?  [Person2]:  Mmm, delicious! Here, have a bite.  [Person1]:  Mmm, it's good. Do you want to try some of mine?  [Person2]:  OK, just a bit. Oops-I dropped my fork. Excuse me. . .  [Person3]:  Yes, is anything wrong?  [Person2]:  I dropped my fork. Could you bring me another one, please?  [Person3]:  Certainly, ma'am. 
[Person1]:  What's your email address?  [Person2]:  It's bluedog123.  [Person1]:  Bluedog123. Are you sure that's all?  [Person2]:  Yes.  [Person1]:  No. That's incomplete.  [Person2]:  What do you mean?  [Person1]:  What's your mailing address?  [Person2]:  456 Cherry Drive, Pasadena, CA 91170.  [Person1]:  That's correct.  [Person2]:  So what's the problem?  [Person1]:  Bluedog123 is just the street. You have to give me the city, state, and ZIP code.  [Person2]:  Oh, I get it. My email address is bluedog123@yahoo. com. 
[Person1]:  Nowadays fewer and fewer people go to the movie theaters to see films. So I am afraid that the film studios are really getting hard time to survive. [Person2]:  What you said is true. But the film producers there are more flexible ways to get more audience. For example, to make more movie Ccds, so people will spend money buying them. [Person1]:  But it is true that cinemas are losing the attraction they used to have in the past. [Person2]:  Yes. Take myself for example. I seldom go to cinemas, but it doesn't mean I no longer see films ; instead, I see films at home-watching Ccds.
[Person1]:  Are there running groups in this neighborhood? I've been wanting to run in the mornings, but I don't like to do it alone. [Person2]:  Yeah, there is a group that meets at the park a few blocks from the university. They meet every Sunday morning. [Person1]:  I should join them. I wonder how far they run. [Person2]:  They usually run to the river, about a mile I think. [Person1]:  No, that would be about 3 miles. I usually only run, too. [Person2]:  Well, maybe running with other people will give you more energy. When I bike with others, I always go faster and farther.
[Person1]:  Good morning, everyone. In the studio today we have Steve Jackson, who's going to tell us about his recent trip to the Antarctic. So Steve, what was it like? Did you freeze? [Person2]:  No, I didn't. While I was there, the temperature was about 7 degrees and I found it quite comfortable. It can get storming in the Antarctic but the seas were calm. [Person1]:  I guess you should take warm clothes. [Person2]:  Well, you really need that. But what I found most useful was dark sunglasses. The sun can get really strong with the reflection of the snow and the ice. [Person1]:  What were the other passengers like? [Person2]:  All the atmosphere aboard the ship was great. The crews were mainly American and they did their best to get everyone to mix. [Person1]:  Did you come across any people apart from your fellow tourists? [Person2]:  Yes, a few of the scientists at a research station. They gave his coffee and biscuits one morning. [Person1]:  What's your best memory of the trip? [Person2]:  Hard to say really. There are so many. We saw a lot of wildlife, but I guess what I most treasured is the large variety of birds we saw. [Person1]:  I guess the area was totally untouched before the scientists arrived. [Person2]:  Well, actually there used to be a booming fishing industry in the area at one time. But all that's left are some deserted buildings now. No old boats are machines or anything like that, though.
[Person1]:  Mr. James. I know that office hour is up now, but could you work during the weekend and finish the translations? [Person2]:  Well, unfortunately I have got something to do this weekend. But let me see... [Person1]:  Oh, I'm sorry. However, if you could help me out, I'll double the pay for the hours worked. [Person2]:  That's very kind of you. How soon do you really need them? [Person1]:  I'll need them for the conference on Monday afternoon. Do you think it can be done by then? [Person2]:  I'll try. [Person1]:  Thank you very much, Mr. James.
[Person1]:  Wow, American football is more exciting than I thought. [Person2]:  You're in America now, my British friend. We just call it football. [Person1]:  Oh, right. So, I can't quite follow what's going on. . . who's winning? [Person2]:  The Giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked, but the Redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone. [Person1]:  Wow! What a hit! [Person2]:  Yeah, he tackled him so hard his helmet came off. [Person1]:  Is he ok? [Person2]:  It looks like it, he's getting up. [Person1]:  I guess he hit him too hard ; the referee just called a penalty on the home team. [Person2]:  The Giants? [Person1]:  Yeah. [Person2]:  Well, here we go again. [Person1]:  What happened? Why did everyone get so quiet? [Person2]:  The Redskin's quarterback just threw a touchdown pass for seven points. We're losing again.
[Person1]:  Do you like watching the Winter Olympic Games? [Person2]:  Of course. It's the tradition game in winter, and with good reason. Don't you like watching it? [Person1]:  Of course I do. I love it. All the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable. [Person2]:  That's true. For various reasons, it takes more to hold a fierce game for Winter Olympics than it does for Summer Olympics. You know, the low temperature may cause many problems. [Person1]:  Yeah. What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics? [Person2]:  When the Olympic Games started in modern times, only summer events were included. When it grew popular, there came the Winter Olympic Games, which includes a variety of winter sports. [Person1]:  I see. Then, what's your favorite winter sport? [Person2]:  Figure skating. In my eye, nothing beats it. [Person1]:  Then you must know Shen Due and Hao Hongbo. [Person2]:  Oh, I didn't expect you to know them. But yes, I love them not only because of many medals they've won, but also because of their spirits. [Person1]:  You should go to talk with May. She is a big fan of them too. [Person2]:  Sure. What about you? What do you like about the Olympics? [Person1]:  For me, the Olympics for the disabled always catches my heart. It makes me understand that perseverance makes the impossible possible. [Person2]:  Hey, young man, you are so deep today. [Person1]:  I always am. You just didn't notice.
[Person1]:  I wish I knew who had moved our flower pots. [Person2]:  It was me. I am so sorry. [Person1]:  What did you think you were doing? [Person2]:  I had to move it, so that I can get my bike through. [Person1]:  How dare you be so inconsiderate? That's wrong. [Person2]:  I am awfully sorry. I didn't think you would mind so much. [Person1]:  Never do that again. [Person2]:  I promise.
[Person1]:  Good coming, sir. What can I do for you? [Person2]:  Good coming. I would like to open a new account. I want to deposit 500 dollars. [Person1]:  Very good, sir. What kind would you like? [Person2]:  Could you tell me how many kinds there are in your bank? [Person1]:  Besides the checking account, there's a monthly savings account and a daily interest account. [Person2]:  Oh, I think I'd like to take the monthly savings account then. [Person1]:  Would you fill out this form? [Person2]:  OK. Here you are. [Person1]:  All right. And here's your deposit book. [Person2]:  Thank you. Goodbye. [Person1]:  Goodbye.
[Person1]:  I really want to get something to eat. [Person2]:  What are you going to get? [Person1]:  I don't know what I want to eat. [Person2]:  Well, do you want burgers, English food, or French food? [Person1]:  French food sounds good. [Person2]:  Where are you going to get it from? [Person1]:  I haven't the slightest idea. [Person2]:  I usually get my French food from the Paris. [Person1]:  You like the Paris? [Person2]:  The food there is actually pretty good. [Person1]:  Maybe I'll go there then. [Person2]:  You should. I know you'll like it.
[Person1]:  Is there anything I can do for you? [Person2]:  I would like to go to Europe for a visit? Can you recommend me an interesting city? [Person1]:  Why not go to Paris? It's famous for Arch of Triumph, Eiffel, versailles and place de la Concorde. [Person2]:  Do you have a package tour to Paris? [Person1]:  Of course, we have.
[Person1]:  We cannot avoid being asked questions in the interview. Sometimes, my mind goes blank. [Person2]:  It is so terrible to be caught unaware. [Person1]:  Admittedly, you can get prepared in advance for the interview, but you cannot cover everything concerned. [Person2]:  Sure. So you should know how to deal with the probable questions and then make flexible reply. [Person1]:  Firstly, your answer should go straight to the point, and be clear and brief. [Person2]:  State your opinion or argument first, and then go on with details. [Person1]:  Never should you give an answer completely beside the point. [Person2]:  If you indeed don't know how to answer, admit it frankly. [Person1]:  Pretending to know when you do not know may expose yourself to ridicule. [Person2]:  Confirm the question if you don't catch it clearly. [Person1]:  Try to avoid the possible duplicate answer if you can. [Person2]:  It can help you leave a deep impression on the interviewer.
[Person1]:  Did you put this morning's faxes on my desk? I'm waiting for some urgent faxes from headquarters, I'm pretty sure they came in last night. [Person2]:  Everything that came in off the fax machine last night is all on your desk. But I noticed that some of the faxes came through pretty blurred. Maybe you can take a look at them. If the copy is unreadable, I'll call them and ask them to relax. [Person1]:  Yeah, you're going to have to call them and get them to be re-faxed. These copies are so dark, I can't make out any of the words. [Person2]:  What about that one? [Person1]:  This one? This one is so light I can barely read it. How can that be? [Person2]:  You know, I think the fax machine is out of toner, I can change the toner cartridge. That should solve the problem. [Person1]:  Yes, but this one will have to be re-faxed as well. And look, there's about three pages missing! It looks loke the fax machine ate half my important faxes, and the ones that made it through are so blurred or too light, they're unreadable! [Person2]:  I guess the fax machine is out of paper, too. Don't worry, I'll have someone look at it this afternoon, and in the meantime, I'll have your documents re-faxed to our other fax machine.
[Person1]:  I'd like to send this parcel to Spain, please. [Person2]:  Do you want to send it by airmail or by surface mail? [Person1]:  Well, how long will it take if I send it by surface mail? [Person2]:  About five weeks. [Person1]:  Oh, dear. It won't get there for New Year's Day if I send it by surface mail. How much will it cost if I send it by air? [Person2]:  Just a moment. I'll weigh it.
[Person1]:  Mike! What's going on, man! Long time no see! [Person2]:  Hey, Pat! Yeah, I haven't seen you in ages! How is going? [Person1]:  Things doing great! It's funny running into you like this. Smell well, just last week I ran into Matt as well. [Person2]:  Yeah? How's he doing? [Person1]:  He's doing well. We went out for a couple of beers and the funniest thing happened. [Person2]:  Oh yeah? [Person1]:  Well, we were talking and catching up on what we'Ve been doing, talking about work and family, when all of a sudden, Matt saw a mouse run under his chair and he completely lost it! He started freaking out, and screaming. . . [Person2]:  Ha ha, really? [Person1]:  Yeah, and the funniest thing was, that he jumped on to his chair and started shrieking like a girl. You had to be there! Everyone was staring and laughing. . . it was hilarious!
[Person1]:  You Americans are funny. It seems as if you were married with cars. [Person2]:  Yeah, I guess that's true. The country is becoming one big highway. I was reading that there are about 4 million miles of roads and highways in this country now.
[Person1]:  Can I help you?  [Person2]:  I'd like to buy a tie to match this suit.  [Person1]:  We have various colors. How about this one?  [Person2]:  Well, the color is all right. But it looks outdated. Can you show me that one?  [Person1]:  You have a very good taste. It's our best seller.  [Person2]:  Really?  [Person1]:  Sure! Look, it suits you well. 
[Person1]:  Welcome, how may I help you today? [Person2]:  I'd like a pizza, please. [Person1]:  Then you'll be happy to hear that today. All our pizzas are on sale 2 for one. [Person2]:  You're right, that is great! [Person1]:  What size would you like? [Person2]:  A medium one would be perfect. Thank you. [Person1]:  Which kind you want? [Person2]:  I like seafood on my pizza. [Person1]:  We have 2 seafood pizzas, fish and crab. [Person2]:  Crab sounds good, today. [Person1]:  Will that be for here, or take away? [Person2]:  That will be to go. [Person1]:  That should only be about 10 minutes. Please sit over there and I will call you over as soon as it's ready. [Person2]:  No problem.
[Person1]:  Did you read this? It says that the number one new years resolution make is to spend more time with friends and family. [Person2]:  Why would that be funny? [Person1]:  Well, think about it. We are a society that is always on the go, not because we have to, but because we want to. [Person2]:  Why? [Person1]:  We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary. [Person2]:  I don't agree, but anyways, I think you should start thinking of a new year's resolution yourself. [Person1]:  What's the point? We always make a new year's resolution and by February we will have forgotten about it. It's pointless. [Person2]:  Well then maybe you should resolve to sticking to your goals and objectives. [Person1]:  What about you? Your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet to be jogged in. [Person2]:  Well, I would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me everyday! [Person1]:  Yeah, yeah, whatever.
[Person1]:  My name is Ella Grady. I'm in the customer service department. I'm the European customer service manager. [Person2]:  So, are you in charge of the department? [Person1]:  No, I report to the customer service manager David. He sits there. [Person2]:  Ah, the boss is here. [Person1]:  Yes, and is your boss here? [Person2]:  No. She isn't on the training course fortunately. So, Ella, you aren't the department manager, but do you have a team in the department? [Person1]:  Yeah, there are many teams in the department. I manage a small team of assistance. 5 people were responsible for customers in Europe and our other teams deal with other regions, Asia, North America and so on. [Person2]:  And do you have direct contact with customers? Do you speak to them? [Person1]:  Oh yes, the difficult ones usually. I deal with problems most of the time.
[Person1]:  I would like to buy a black suit. [Person2]:  Do you have any special brand in your mind? [Person1]:  No, I never wear suit in my everyday life. I just want one to take part in my sister ' s wedding ceremony. [Person2]:  I see. Have a look at this one. It ' s very cheap because it ' s not very durable. [Person1]:  but it looks good. Let me try it on. [Person2]:  Ok, the mirror is over there.
[Person1]:  Amelia, could you spare a few minutes? [Person2]:  sure. What do you need? [Person1]:  well, I wanted to let you know that I've put in my notice. [Person2]:  really? Why? [Person1]:  it's complicated. But basically it boils down to one thing. This company is downsizing and I can't continue working for a company that may let me go. [Person2]:  but surely they won't fire you! You're one of the most experienced managers here! [Person1]:  well, to be honest, there's another reason. I've got a better offer. [Person2]:  well that's great news! Congratulations! Where will you be located? [Person1]:  the head office is in New York, but I'll be dealing with overseas companies and flying to this side of the world from time to time. [Person2]:  it'll be sad to see you go, but it sounds like you're found yourself a great opportunity. [Person1]:  I have. I feel lucky. I look forward to dealing with overseas companies and at the same time having a chance to use English more. [Person2]:  I'm sorry to bring this up, but would it be possible for you to write me a letter of recommendation before you go? [Person1]:  of course I can. In fact, if there are other job opportunities at this new company, I'll recommend you personally. [Person2]:  thanks. I appreciate that.
[Person1]:  Merry Christmas, sweetie. How's your brother enjoying Taiwan? [Person2]:  Ryan says he wants to stay. I think he's in love with some girl who designs fruit platters. . . [Person1]:  No! Christmas without him is bad enough. So, honey, do you have cold feet yet? [Person2]:  Yeah, especially since Jack didn't take care of the plane reservations. [Person1]:  You're not coming? [Person2]:  Not until the 31st. So can you change the church reservations? [Person1]:  I'm afraid not. The church is booked until the year 2001. [Person2]:  Then where will we have the ceremony? At home? [Person1]:  We'll have to. We'll rehearse on the 1st and have the wedding on the 2nd. [Person2]:  I'm sorry, Mom. [Person1]:  Don't worry, dear. I'm a great host. Now get some rest. Merry Christmas. [Person2]:  Merry Christmas, Mom. I love you. [Person1]:  I love you, too. And forgive Jack. He's doing his best. [Person2]:  I know. Goodnight.
[Person1]:  Ah! No! Damn it! [Person2]:  It's a blackout. Now I can't see Seinfeld. [Person1]:  So what? I just lost one hour's worth of work. [Person2]:  Really? How could you do that? Don't you save every couple minutes? [Person1]:  No, I didn't save this time. Damn it! And I'm sick of writing this paper. Now I have to write it all over again too. [Person2]:  I've had that problem too many times. So I learned to save. When I'm writing something, I save every three sentences or so. I don't want to lose anything. [Person1]:  I hate computers. Sometimes I think they cause more trouble than they're worth. [Person2]:  What are we going to do now? [Person1]:  I don't know. I feel like going out. [Person2]:  I wonder how much of the city is down. [Person1]:  It doesn't matter. I still can go out and buy a beer. [Person2]:  Maybe. But if there's a blackout, probably the pubs are closed. And besides, I know you have a political science exam tomorrow. I thought you had a lot of reading to do. [Person1]:  Yes, that's true. Damn! I just lost half my paper, and now I can't even do my homework. This is a bad time for this to happen. [Person2]:  I have a flashlight in my closet. If you want to use that to read, you can. [Person1]:  Thanks. I think I will try. Where are you going? [Person2]:  I like your idea of getting a beer. I think I'll go out myself. [Person1]:  Maybe we can trade. Why don't you stay here and read for my exam, and I'll go drink beer? [Person2]:  No, it just won't work. If I read for your exam, you won't know the answers tomorrow. I will. [Person1]:  So? You can go to the class for me. Just write my name on the exam book and take the exam. Why not? [Person2]:  How many students are in the class? [Person1]:  About fourteen. [Person2]:  So it won't work, old buddy. They'll see that I'm not you. Sorry. [Person1]:  Damn!
[Person1]:  I'm calling about you appointment. Mr. Smith has to cancel all his appointments because he's got something urgent to attend to. [Person2]:  When can I go to see him? [Person1]:  Anytime except today. Please give him a call before you come. [Person2]:  OK.
[Person1]:  Isn't he the best instructor? I think * he's so hot. Wow! I really feel energized, don't you? [Person2]:  I swear, I'm going to kill you for this. [Person1]:  What's wrong? Didn't you think it was fun? ! [Person2]:  Oh, yeah! I had a blast! I love sweating like a pig with a bunch of pot bellies who all smell bad. Sorry, I'm just not into this health kick. [Person1]:  Oh, no, get off it. It wasn't such a killer class. You just have to get into it. Like they say, no pain, no gain. [Person2]:  I am wiped out. Thank you. [Person1]:  Look, next time get yourself some comfy shoes. You're gonna come back again with me, aren't you? [Person2]:  Never! But thank you for inviting me. [Person1]:  Come on. You'll feel better after we hit the showers.
[Person1]:  Hi, Anna. I haven't seen you for ages. Where have you been? [Person2]:  I'Ve been away on holidays for sometime. [Person1]:  No wonder I haven't seen you recently. Where did you spend your holidays? [Person2]:  I went with my husband. Our first stop was Bangkok. We stayed there for 5 days. Then we flew to Hong Kong, stopover for 3 days. Our last stop was China. We visited the Great Wall. [Person1]:  You must have a wonderful time. [Person2]:  Yes. We enjoyed ourselves very much. Have you traveled much, Luke? [Person1]:  No, my wife doesn't like traveling. We haven't been traveling for more than ten years. The first time we traveled together was in 1978 when we just got married. We spent our honeymoon in the Alps.
[Person1]:  What happened to your brother? [Person2]:  It seems that he has gone ape over the girl. [Person1]:  Your parents must be worrying about him. [Person2]:  Yes, he's been like this for two weeks. We don't know what to do. [Person1]:  Have you talked to him? [Person2]:  Yeah. But he just didn't listen.
[Person1]:  How about going to dance this evening, Jane? You will find that the night life of this city is very interesting! [Person2]:  Good idea. There is a good nightclub nearby, isn't it? [Person1]:  Yes, the dance hall is nice with various styles of music. [Person2]:  ( In the club ) Look at those people in the dance floor, they are so crazy. [Person1]:  That's rock and roll with fast tempo. [Person2]:  I like the slow dance. I am good at rumba and waltz. [Person1]:  Take it easy. The time for slow dance is the middle part of the party. [Person2]:  Let's find a quiet seat and sit down for beverage. [Person1]:  OK, follow me. [Person2]:  Listen, it is waltz. I like the elegant step of the old styles. [Person1]:  May I? [Person2]:  Sure. [Person1]:  ( When they are dancing ) You dance gracefully!
[Person1]:  When could we meet to discuss the project? [Person2]:  I will be available on Monday or Tuesday. Choose which day is best for you. [Person1]:  I prefer Monday. [Person2]:  Good. Can you come in the morning or would afternoon be best? [Person1]:  Either one is OK. [Person2]:  Great! When I check with the others, I will send you an exact time. When you come, be prepared to do your presentation. [Person1]:  I will be prepared to do my presentation. [Person2]:  Who would you like to see there? Just the sub-committee or should we ask the whole committee? [Person1]:  Everyone needs to be there. [Person2]:  That will probably be best. Do you need help with directions? [Person1]:  I think I know where it is. Maybe you could send me directions just to make sure. [Person2]:  OK. We will e-mail you all the information you need tomorrow. Have a good day!
[Person1]:  This website offers very convenient air tickets booking service. It is quick and accurate. [Person2]:  Yes, I once booked there. They give the immediate confirm information and flight information to both your mobile phone and e-mail. You can conveniently pay by credit card, so the whole transaction only takes a couple of minutes. They also provide e-tickets, meaning you don't need to go to any office to pick an air ticket. You go to the airport directly and check in with your ID card. [Person1]:  So it has attracted more and more customers these days. [Person2]:  Yes, therefore they are expanding the scope of their service. For example, hotels can be booked through the same site as well.
[Person1]:  What am I supposed to do with this plastic cup? [Person2]:  That cup is for a urine sample. [Person1]:  How, exactly, does this work? [Person2]:  This particular test calls for you to urinate into the cup after you have urinated a little into the toilet. [Person1]:  When I finish, what should I do then? [Person2]:  You need to leave the cup in the cubby in the restroom, and the lab tech will get it from the other side. [Person1]:  What is my doctor testing me for? [Person2]:  If there are bacteria in your urine, it could mean an infection somewhere. [Person1]:  Will I know the results right away? [Person2]:  Your doctor will be contacting you with the results.
[Person1]:  Good morning, I'm Daniel. I'm applying for the positon of manager. [Person2]:  Yes. Sit down, please. How did you learn about our company? [Person1]:  I got to know your company through such famous brands as LUX, LIPTON and WALLS. After making a customer survey, I was glad to find out how your products are appreciated by millions of Chinese. [Person2]:  Why would you like to work with us? [Person1]:  It's the job I'm interested in. And your company is the best-known. Although I don't have much experience as a manager, the job description you sent to me was very interesting. It's a job I'Ve been dreaming of and I feel suited to fill it. [Person2]:  Oh, really? Would you transfer to another company if it is not what you expected? [Person1]:  I don't think so. As the saying goes, ' A great oak needs deep roots. ' I'm really interested in this job. [Person2]:  That's fine. Thanks for coming to see us. I hope to be able to let you know about the job within the week.
[Person1]:  If the weather is this hot tomorrow, we may as well give up the idea of playing tennis in the afternoon. [Person2]:  Oh, I don't think it'll last long. The weather forecast says it will cloud over by mid-afternoon
[Person1]:  What would you do if you were in my place? [Person2]:  If Paul were my son, I'd just not worry. Now that his teacher is giving him extra help and he's working hard himself, he's sure to do well in the next exam.
[Person1]:  Have you ever been to Japan? I'm going in the fall.  [Person2]:  Yeah, I've been there twice.  [Person1]:  Really? Tell me about it. What's it like?  [Person2]:  Oh, it's fantastic.  [Person1]:  Where did you go?  [Person2]:  On my first trip I went to Tokyo, and on my second trip I visited Kyoto.  [Person1]:  What did you think of Tokyo?  [Person2]:  Very big and exciting, but very crowded, too.  [Person1]:  Yeah. I've seen pictures of the crowds!  [Person2]:  And the restaurant are excellent . . . but they're kind of expensive.  [Person1]:  And how about Kyoto?  [Person2]:  Kyoto is lovely. It's full of beautiful old temples and gardens. It's a very historic city.  [Person1]:  How was the weather?  [Person2]:  I was in Tokyo in August, and it was really hot and humid. I went to Kyoto in October. It was hot and sunny, but there was no humidity.  [Person1]:  Sounds perfect. I can't wait! 
[Person1]:  The idea about Friday the Thirteenth is totally ridiculous. I don't believe it at all.  [Person2]:  Maybe you can't be so sure.  [Person1]:  Why not? The whole idea is superstitious. But some people use this occasion to create trouble. Have you heard of the Black Friday Virus on the computer? It is designed to break out on every Friday the Thirteenth.  [Person2]:  I know that. But that has nothing to do with being unlucky. Those who created the virus are deliberately making fun of people. 
[Person1]:  I can't decide whether to go to university or to get a job. [Person2]:  Well, if I were you, I'd go on studying. [Person1]:  But I don't even know what to study. [Person2]:  If I had chance again, I'd major in English. You're good at language. [Person1]:  That's what my parents want me to do. [Person2]:  You should take their advice. They know what's best for you. But my friends will have jobs and lots of fun, while I spend all my time doing reading and writing. [Person1]:  But if you go to university, you'll still have time for fun. [Person2]:  Hm, what you say makes sense. But you know, I still have to ask my parents for pocket money, and I hate to do so at this age. [Person1]:  And if you try to find a part-time job, you'll have some money too. [Person2]:  You're right. Thank you for the advice.
[Person1]:  What can I do for you, Miss Dickinson? [Person2]:  Yes, doctor. I'm afraid I've caught a cold. [Person1]:  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. When did you first start to feel ill? [Person2]:  Well, yesterday I was wearing a silk skirt, even though it was quite cold outside. And then this morning when I got up, I didn't feel well. Now my head is really heavy. And I've been coughing a lot. [Person1]:  Emm, did the nurse take your temperature when you came in? [Person2]:  Yes, she did. It was 36. 2 degrees. [Person1]:  Uh, yes, I see that here in your chart. Well, Miss Dickinson, the good news is that you don't have a fever. Let me just check your lungs. [Person2]:  Is it serious, doctor? [Person1]:  Don't worry, it's just a normal cold. I don't think you need to take any medicine. Just stay at home for a day. Drink some water, stay warm and you will feel better soon. [Person2]:  OK, doctor. Thank you. [Person1]:  Take care and have a good day, Miss Dickinson.
[Person1]:  The mosquitos are biting me! [Person2]:  Me, too, I can't stop scratching. They are everywhere! Sneaky little jerks. [Person1]:  Do you have any bug spray? [Person2]:  No, I forgot to buy some. [Person1]:  Then we'll have to put up with it. [Person2]:  We can cover ourselves with beer! That way if they bite us, they'll get drunk and fall asleep. [Person1]:  That's without a doubt, the best idea you'Ve had! Let's do it! [Person2]:  Run! They are thirsty for more!
[Person1]:  Good morning, madam. I'd like to apply for a library card. Can you help me? [Person2]:  Yes. Please give me your ID card, a photo. [Person1]:  OK. Here you are. [Person2]:  Then you have to give me 15 dollars for the deposit. The library card is free. [Person1]:  OK. Here is the money. And If I return the card, can I get the refund? [Person2]:  Of course, as long as the card is well kept. [Person1]:  OK. I see. Thank you. [Person2]:  You are welcome.
[Person1]:  Can I help you, sir? [Person2]:  I wish to buy a diamond ring. [Person1]:  How many carats would you like it to be? [Person2]:  I want five carats. [Person1]:  Is this one suitable for you? [Person2]:  No, it seems too old-fashioned to my fiancee. [Person1]:  What about this? [Person2]:  It seems too small for me, haven't you got any larger ones? [Person1]:  Then you can buy this one. It's very nice and latest in style. [Person2]:  Oh, this one is perfect.
[Person1]:  Body language in the interview is closely related to the job-hunter's image. [Person2]:  Surely it is. [Person1]:  You should look the interviewer in the eye so as to show that you are carefully listening to him. [Person2]:  You can nod or ask questions at the right time to show that you have already understood or you are quite interested in his words. [Person1]:  When you are seated, bent forward a little with your hands crossed, to show you respect the interviewer. [Person2]:  Don't move from time to time. It is very impolite and will make you nervous. [Person1]:  Proper posture can show your confidence. [Person2]:  The best would be you have a smile on your face in the interview to win a good impression of the interviewer. [Person1]:  Pay attention to keeping eye contact as well. [Person2]:  Throughout the interview you should maintain patience. [Person1]:  In a word, you should keep decent manners in the interview. [Person2]:  Only in this way can you leave the interviewer a good impression and achieve success.
[Person1]:  Please pull your vehicle over to the side of the road. Please roll down your window. [Person2]:  What's the matter, sir? [Person1]:  Have you been drinking? [Person2]:  No, I haven't, sir. [Person1]:  Really? But I can smell alcohol on your breath. Blow to the breathalyzer, please. [Person2]:  But sir, I didn't drink at all. [Person1]:  If you refuse the blow, you'll receive a ticket and your vehicle will be impounded. [Person2]:  OK, I will blow. [Person1]:  Your BAC exceeds legal limit. [Person2]:  But I. . . [Person1]:  I'll have to write you a ticket and impound your vehicle. [Person2]:  Oh, no!
[Person1]:  Today, you need to pay 20 RMB in handling fees. [Person2]:  Can't you just take it from my account? I can't be bothered with cash dealings today. [Person1]:  I must tell you that because your banking has been such a large amount, you need to wait until you leave the country to get any currency back. [Person2]:  You mean, if there is any left over? [Person1]:  Yes, totally. It's nice to meet a customer who understands the system. [Person2]:  Right, so the deposit, if I don't draw on it will be blocked after you get the Deposit Certification? [Person1]:  That's right. I know we have a complex system, but you have caught on so quickly.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, I'd like to send this parcel. [Person2]:  What's in it, please? [Person1]:  Just a few shirts. [Person2]:  OK. You may wrap it now. Please fill in this form and label it. ( after a moment ) Would you like it registered? [Person1]:  No, I'd rather send it by ordinary mail. [Person2]:  Nine dollars and fifty cents. [Person1]:  Here you are. [Person2]:  Here's the receipt. [Person1]:  Thank you so much. [Person2]:  You're welcome.
[Person1]:  OK! Let's get down to business now. [Person2]:  Say it. [Person1]:  As you know, we should work out cautious and detailed plan for our promotion, so as to guide our company to be successful in the new product, L-series. [Person2]:  That's right. And in my opinion, to push the sale of the new products is not an easy task. [Person1]:  I know that. I need to discuss this with Arden. And in his opinion, we should widen the scope of our ads, so newspaper and Internet should be adopted in this campaign. [Person2]:  Could you put it in detail? [Person1]:  Well. We plan to contact www. on-line advertising. com. cn and Shanghai Morning Newspaper to discuss the advertisement schedule. [Person2]:  I think the idea is very good. In the promotion campaign, two or more media are used together, so as to draw customers'attention and keep hold their attention to larger extent. [Person1]:  What kind of media do you recommend? [Person2]:  I think TV is also an effective media, as long as our company is willing to spend more money on it. [Person1]:  Well. Arden just mentioned the paper and the on-sales. And I can talk about TV with him later, because TV promotion gets more and more popular among consumers. [Person2]:  I also think good advertising is essential to call attention to a product and introduce our L-series products. Meanwhile, ads are also the representation of the company's image.
[Person1]:  Wow, look at the line. It's worse than I expected. We are lucky we got here an hour earlier. Or else we will definitely have had problems getting tickets. I'm glad we made the effort to come early. [Person2]:  Me too. I learned my lesson the last time I went to a new film. I didn't arrive early enough and ended up with a terrible seat all the way in the front row. Believe me, it was one of the worst movie experiences ever. [Person1]:  Yeah. I hate sitting in the first row. [Person2]:  By the way, it was really nice of you to get this ticket for me. Why don't I show you a bit of appreciation by getting you a drink? [Person1]:  That would be great. [Person2]:  OK. What kind of soda do you want? [Person1]:  Let me see. I'll take a large coke. Thanks a lot. [Person2]:  I'd better get going. You hold my place and I'll be back really quick. Oh, I almost forget. I'd better hold on to my ticket in case you get let in before I get back. If that happens, just save me a seat and I'll meet you inside. [Person1]:  OK. It's a plan.
[Person1]:  It's so cold now, but this morning it was so hot and sunny. I wish there was a way I could always be wearing the most suitable clothes for the temperature. [Person2]:  I recently read that in ten years we'll be wearing clothes that change with the weather. So when it's cold, our clothes will warm up, and when it's hot, our clothes will cool off. [Person1]:  Oh, very funny! So we'll be wearing huge clothes with built-in air-conditioners and heaters. [Person2]:  I'm serious. Researchers have discovered a method of treating fibers with plastic crystals which can store and release heat as the temperature changes. These treated fibers absorb more heat than untreated fibers. Researchers are still working with this, but soon this process will be widespredad. [Person1]:  That's fascinating. I didn't know that fibers can store heat. How does that work? [Person2]:  These fibers work with the heat by rearranging their structures. [Person1]:  That's truly unbelievable. You said that it'll be a decade before this type of clothes will be available. What a shame! I don't think I can wait that long.
[Person1]:  I want to buy a farm. I think I'd like to grow wheat, is the ground here good for that? [Person2]:  No, I don't think it's good for farming. [Person1]:  Why do you know so well? [Person2]:  I own a farm here, but farming is very hard work. [Person1]:  But modern farm equipment can make farming easier. [Person2]:  Yes, but you should cut down trees, clear a lot of land and make the soil rich. [Person1]:  I don't mind hard work. I just want to get away from my factory. [Person2]:  You can have my farm at a low price, $ 200, if you want it. [Person1]:  All right. You're giving me the farm, aren't you?
[Person1]:  Would you like to book a table, sir? [Person2]:  Yes, would you arrange it for me the day after tomorrow? [Person1]:  Sure, when? [Person2]:  Six o'clock in the afternoon. [Person1]:  For how many guests, please? [Person2]:  Six. [Person1]:  How much would you like to spend? [Person2]:  We don't care about money. We'd like to have some good dishes of local specialties. [Person1]:  OK. [Person2]:  How many courses are there altogether, please? [Person1]:  Eight. [Person2]:  Could you tell me some of entrees about the dinner? [Person1]:  Sure. The main courses are roast Beijing duck and fried eel slices. [Person2]:  Very good.
[Person1]:  Good morning. Have a seat. [Person2]:  Good morning. Thank you. [Person1]:  I have your letter here. Your name is Robert Martin, right? [Person2]:  That's right. [Person1]:  And you hope to work here next month? [Person2]:  Yes, Madam, if I can. [Person1]:  Fine. You finished high school a year ago. Why didn't you go to college that year? [Person2]:  Well, I have a sister in college now and there will be another one next year. So I have to make a little money for us. [Person1]:  Good. It seems that you are a good young man. By the way, what's your best lesson in high school? [Person2]:  Physics. I really enjoy it. [Person1]:  That's fine. Have you discussed this with your parents? [Person2]:  Oh, sure. My parents said I should decide it myself. [Person1]:  OK, you can work here, but you better go to college if you have a chance. Good luck, young man. [Person2]:  Thank you, madam. Good bye.
[Person1]:  What can I do for you, sir? [Person2]:  I'd like to buy a box of chocolates. [Person1]:  OK. We have dark chocolates, milk chocolates, fruit chocolates and some chocolate with nuts in them. Which kind would you like? [Person2]:  I prefer to buy fruit chocolates, please. My son likes them very much. [Person1]:  All right. Anything else? [Person2]:  Let me see. Oh yes, I want to buy some fruit. Do you have any strawberries? My daughter and my wife like them very much. [Person1]:  Yes, they are over there. You can try one. They are very sweet. [Person2]:  Let me see. Well, they don't look fresh enough. The pears look juicy. I'll take 3 kilos please. How much is the total? [Person1]:  Just a moment, please. 55 yuan for the chocolates, and twenty one for the pairs, that will be 75 yuan in all, please. [Person2]:  Thank you. Here is 100 yuan. [Person1]:  Your change, please. [Person2]:  Thanks.
[Person1]:  You won't believe who's been elected to do overtime on the Baker account! Me! I'Ve already logged in 20 hours of overtime! [Person2]:  Wow! Why so much? I thought they were getting you an assistant. [Person1]:  They were supposed to, but so far nobody's turned up, and I'm left on my own to do the work. This is the first break I'Ve had all day. [Person2]:  They're really running you into the ground. Why don't you ask for some time off? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere. [Person1]:  You won't believe who's been elected to do overtime on the Baker account! Me! I'Ve already logged in 20 hours of overtime! [Person2]:  Wow! Why so much? I thought they were getting you an assistant. [Person1]:  They were supposed to, but so far nobody's turned up, and I'm left on my own to do the work. This is the first break I'Ve had all day.

[Person1]:  I have lots of friends. [Person2]:  Really? How many do you have? [Person1]:  I don't know, maybe one hundred. [Person2]:  That is a lot of friends. Do you have a best friend? [Person1]:  Of course. I have lots of best friends. [Person2]:  How many best friends do you have? [Person1]:  I think about twenty-five. [Person2]:  Hmm. I have only one best friend. [Person1]:  I feel sorry for you. [Person2]:  I have only a few friends. [Person1]:  You must be lonely. I will share my friends with you. [Person2]:  That's very nice of you.
[Person1]:  I want to buy a parking permit, please. [Person2]:  Are you a full-time student or do you attend part-time in the evenings? [Person1]:  I attend both day and evening classes. [Person2]:  Will you be riding a motorcycle or do you drive a car? [Person1]:  I ride a motorcycle. [Person2]:  That permit will run twenty-five dollars ; will that be cash or credit card? [Person1]:  I'll use a credit card, thank you. [Person2]:  Do you need a second permit for a car? [Person1]:  No, just the motorcycle permit. [Person2]:  Fine, here it is and have a great semester!
[Person1]:  Do you know something about Mount Tai? [Person2]:  Yes. But not too much. It is considered as the head of five sacred mountains in China. [Person1]:  Five sacred mountains? Why people call them so? [Person2]:  Because in history, the Chinese emperors used to climb onto these mountains and pay tribute to their ancestors and pray for good harvest and prosperity for the whole nation. [Person1]:  Got it. Can we see any things left by them? [Person2]:  Definitely. There are many wall paintings and inscriptions on the huge rocks on the mountain. [Person1]:  I want to see them. How can I go there? [Person2]:  That is easy. You can go directly to Tai'an city and buy a ticket to Mount Tai.
[Person1]:  Excuse me! Are you Bart Simpson from Western Electronics? [Person2]:  Yes, I am. [Person1]:  I am Steven. I am here to meet you. [Person2]:  Thank you for meeting me at the airport, Steven. [Person1]:  You must be tired after the long flight. Let me carry the bags for you. [Person2]:  Thanks. Where is our car? [Person1]:  Our car is in the parking lot. We've booked a room for you. I will take you to the hotel soon. Let's go. [Person2]:  OK. Let's go.
[Person1]:  I need to see if I qualify for a home loan. [Person2]:  I can help you. How much money do you make per year? [Person1]:  I make around one hundred thousand dollars per year. [Person2]:  How long have you been on your current job? [Person1]:  I have only worked at this job for 6 months, but I have a longer job history elsewhere. [Person2]:  Do you have any other outside income from rental property or a trust? [Person1]:  No, I only receive my salary. [Person2]:  Do you know your credit score?

[Person1]:  Excuse me, what's the screen near your steering wheel for? [Person2]:  It's a portable TV. It's a popular thing now. [Person1]:  Oh, that's new to me. So what's on everyday? [Person2]:  News about current affairs, documentaries, music, movies, noncommercial ads and so on. [Person1]:  Is there anything interesting? [Person2]:  Yes, there are something good and informative. I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education. [Person1]:  I agree. Are there any commercials on the TV? [Person2]:  Of course. Because the TV stations need to make money from commercials between the programs. [Person1]:  That makes a lot of sense. Does the TV work well? [Person2]:  Not always. It depends on the transmission of the satellite signals. [Person1]:  I got it. Do you pay for the programs? [Person2]:  Yes, 50 Yuan per month. [Person1]:  It is a little bit expensive, but it's worth it. [Person2]:  Yeah. You know driving is boring. TV can get me out of the fatigue of driving. [Person1]:  It can also entertain your passengers like me. [Person2]:  That's the point.
[Person1]:  I am having some plumbing problems and need them fixed. [Person2]:  What exactly is wrong with the plumbing? [Person1]:  The toilet flushes really slowly. [Person2]:  Are there any problems with the plumbing in the kitchen? [Person1]:  Both the kitchen and the bathroom plumbing are messed up. [Person2]:  How long have you had these problems? [Person1]:  It has been going on for a while, but just started to get worse this morning. [Person2]:  I will send someone out to take a look at the problem. Will you be home this afternoon? [Person1]:  Yes, I will be home this afternoon. [Person2]:  Fine. I will be there around two. If someone is not there, I will use my key to get in.
[Person1]:  Well, Miss Liu, I've enjoyed talking with you. Thank you for your interest in this job. [Person2]:  It's my honor, Mr. Mike. By the way, how can I know whether I am accepted or not? [Person1]:  We hope to make a decision in the next few days. We'll notify you of our decision by mail, is this convenient for you? [Person2]:  Yes. Thank you very much. I am looking forward to hearing from you. [Person1]:  Good luck to you, good-bye. [Person2]:  Good-bye.
[Person1]:  Good morning, Mr. Bell. How are you today? Are you here to sort out your L / C documents? [Person2]:  Yes. I've been through them and there's a problem, a rather major discrepancy actually. You see? It should be KN509. [Person1]:  I see, here it says KM509. [Person2]:  Exactly, if we accept these it could cause a lot of problems in our record and our accounts system because the numbers don't match. [Person1]:  Yes, I see what you mean. You need to reject these documents.
[Person1]:  These vegetables taste very sweet. [Person2]:  Sure, I planted them. They're organic. [Person1]:  Really? Dad, how do you know how to plant organic vegetable? [Person2]:  Well, it's a secret. [Person1]:  Dad, come on! Just tell me. [Person2]:  Well, honey, I can teach you how to plant them if you want to learn.
[Person1]:  Hello, this is Freda speaking. [Person2]:  Hello, Freda. It is me-Steven. I was wondering if you'd like to watch football games with me. [Person1]:  Yes, I'd like to. But when? [Person2]:  Well, how about Friday evening? [Person1]:  Oh, I'm afraid I can't. I've got to work until 9 o'clock. [Person2]:  Oh, what a pity! [Person1]:  But what about Saturday evening? I'm free then. [Person2]:  Yes, Saturday evening would be fine. [Person1]:  Oh, good. What time shall we meet? [Person2]:  Shall we say a quarter to seven? [Person1]:  Right. I'll see you then.
[Person1]:  Oh, I wish we had taken the lift. [Person2]:  Cheer up. It's already on the 8th floor. [Person1]:  But I am really tired out. [Person2]:  Just think it's helpful for our health. [Person1]:  Possibly, but if I know it was so far up, I wouldn't have suggested walking.
[Person1]:  Hello, Jim. Where are you going? [Person2]:  To the cinema. What about coming with me? [Person1]:  No, thanks. I'm going home. My friend's expecting me. [Person2]:  What a pity! I believe it's a very good film. [Person1]:  Do you go to the cinema a lot? [Person2]:  Once a week. Most nights I sit at home and watch TV. [Person1]:  Oh, I see. By the way, where are you going for your holidays this year? [Person2]:  I don't know yet. My wife's going to her mother's for a couple of weeks. She lives by the sea, you know. [Person1]:  Oh, does she? That's convenient. [Person2]:  Yes, but I want to go to the country. [Person1]:  Don't you like the sea? [Person2]:  Yes, very much. But I need peace and quiet when I'm on holiday.
[Person1]:  I really need a vacation. I just can't decide where to go. [Person2]:  Have you ever been to Curacao? [Person1]:  No, I haven't. It's so far. [Person2]:  Oh, come on! In this day and age, nothing is far. Besides, once you get there, it's like being in paradise. I really think you should consider it. In fact, I suggest you ask your travel agent about it. [Person1]:  What's so great about Curacao? It's just another tropical island with a pretty beach. [Person2]:  Just another tropical island? Bright sunny days with blue water rolling upon to the clean white sand. Gentle winds blowing through the palm trees of clear move at night. Come on! It's a tremendous place to go. [Person1]:  Oh, I don't know. [Person2]:  Look! You can go wherever you want. But it's important that you relax during your vacation. And Curacao is the perfect place for that. I mean, you can do all the things you like to do. Play tennis, swim, read, rest, not to mention eat well and get a great suntan. Why are you so hesitant? Come on! Be adventurous. [Person1]:  You're certainly making it sound better by the minute. OK, maybe I'll check it out with my travel agent. [Person2]:  I suggest you hurry. This is a very busy time of the year. And reservations aren't always easy to get. And it is absolutely necessary that you have reservations.
[Person1]:  I'm sorry I'm late, Cindy. [Person2]:  That's alright, Joe. My house isn't that easy to find. But you know, you wouldn't have gotten lost if you had a smart car. [Person1]:  A smart car? What's that? [Person2]:  I just read a magazine article about some new technology that can make a car smart, that something like a GPS with a map display and a voice. You just enter the address where you want to go and the voice tells you how to get there street by street. [Person1]:  Hey. That's just like my brother. He never gets lost and he's always telling me the best route. So what else will smart cars be able to do? [Person2]:  Well. The article said that they'll be equipped with warning systems that will warn drivers if they're getting too close to other cars with an alarm signal. And they'll even put on the brakes if the drivers don't. [Person1]:  It seemed to be reported on TV, too. Tell me, Cindy, will these cars be smart enough to fill themselves up with gas? [Person2]:  Not that I know of. Why do you ask? [Person1]:  Well, I'm not late, because I got lost. I am late because I ran out of gas on the way over here.
[Person1]:  Hello, Can I speak to Tom, please? [Person2]:  I'm afraid he is not in at the moment. [Person1]:  May I ask what time he will come back? [Person2]:  I think he will come back at 3 p. m. Do you want to call later? Or would you like to leave a message for him? [Person1]:  I'd like to leave a message. Please ask him to call me back as soon as he returns. I'm A and he has my number. [Person2]:  OK. I will do that. [Person1]:  Thank you very much. Bye. [Person2]:  You're welcome. Bye.
[Person1]:  Are you watching another news report about the war? [Person2]:  Yes. The two sides declared a short ceasefire but it broke down earlier today. Several military target were destroyed by bombing. Many civilians were among the dead and wounded. [Person1]:  How did this war start? [Person2]:  Bout side claim a small area of territory. Both sides tried to build border fences and began attacking each other. [Person1]:  Politicians from both sides sound increasingly belligerent. Neither side wants to compromise. [Person2]:  Relief agencies report that many civilians are in desperate need of food and shelter. Several European countries have agreed to send aid, but are afraid that their planes will be shot down. [Person1]:  What do you think will happen? [Person2]:  Both countries are very poor. Soon they will run out of money to finance the war. Then, perhaps, they will negotiate. [Person1]:  It would be much simpler and cheaper if they negotiated first.
[Person1]:  Ugh. Another advertisement. They'Ve added two hours of advertisements to a two hours movie. [Person2]:  Yeah. We're never going to get to the end of this one. [Person1]:  Why are we watching it anyway? [Person2]:  Well, it does have a lot of girls in it. [Person1]:  True. True. [Person2]:  Do you think Bruce Willis just drank a Coke for his health? [Person1]:  Really? Did Coke pay him for that? [Person2]:  Of course. [Person1]:  You want something to drink? [Person2]:  Yeah, Got a Coke? [Person1]:  Sure. [Person2]:  Hurry, the movie is coming back on.
[Person1]:  How can I lose weight, doctor? I seem to get fatter even when I just look at food? [Person2]:  Well, Jim. It is a combination of how much you eat, the type of food you eat, and when you eat your meals. [Person1]:  I never eat breakfast though. [Person2]:  That's a big mistake, you should always have a good breakfast. You will not run your car without fuel, and as well you won't expect your body to work without food. [Person1]:  I never thought about it that way. [Person2]:  I bet you eat a large evening meal, then sit and watch TV or read a book. Then instead of burning off your energy, your body stores it as fat. [Person1]:  Oh doctor, I feel so foolish. [Person2]:  Well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits. [Person1]:  I know doctor, thank you so much.
[Person1]:  You will never guess where my family is going for summer vacation. [Person2]:  Let me try. It has to be somewhere amazing, and far away. . . Egypt? [Person1]:  How in the world did you guess that? Did someone tell you already? [Person2]:  Yes. I overheard your mom and my mom talking in the grocery store. [Person1]:  I want to ride a camel and definitely see the pyramids! [Person2]:  I wish our family took outrageous summer vacations like yours. [Person1]:  It helps that my dad is an archaeologist. [Person2]:  We'll get to go fishing at the river. I hate fish.
[Person1]:  How much do you expect to earn? [Person2]:  I think salary is closely related to the responsibilities of the job. Shall we discuss my responsibilities with your company first? [Person1]:  If you are hired, you are in charge of the design of toys that can meet the needs of the American market. [Person2]:  I know it is a crucial position, but I can do it well. So I'm asking for 200, 000 Yuan a year as a starting salary. [Person1]:  Ok.
[Person1]:  Put all baggage on the conveyor belt. Walk through the detector gate one at a time, please. Excuse me, ma'ma. Could you walk back through the doorway again, please? [Person2]:  What for? [Person1]:  Airport security. Could you empty your pockets over here, please? [Person2]:  Really? I'm in a hurry. All right. [Person1]:  Ah, a set of keys. [Person2]:  I'm embarrassed! I forgot completely about them. I'm terribly sorry. [Person1]:  That's all right. Enjoy your flight. [Person2]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  Good day. Is this the Business Centre? [Person2]:  It is. What can I do for you? [Person1]:  I want to make a deposit. [Person2]:  Would that be a Fixed Deposit or a Current Deposit? [Person1]:  A Current Deposit, please. [Person2]:  We have various different types of Current Deposit, the Variable Term Deposit, a Notice Deposit and the Usual Current Deposit. Which would you like? [Person1]:  Arm. . . just the usual, Current Deposit please. [Person2]:  OK, just a moment. I'll find the relevant data and help you with that.
[Person1]:  Oh, Tim! What happened to you? It's terrible enough for you to be here. [Person2]:  Kate, may be you can't believe it. It is just because of a little too much smoke. I'll be back home this evening. [Person1]:  How did this happen? [Person2]:  I had to go into a house that was on fire. There was still a little girl inside. I got her out. [Person1]:  But there was a lot of smoke. [Person2]:  Yes, a lot. I had some trouble breathing so they sent me here just for the doctors to take a look at me. [Person1]:  And now you tell me that it's all of your job. [Person2]:  Well, it is. You shouldn't worry all the time. [Person1]:  But I do. I hope you'll leave your job. [Person2]:  Leave my job? No, not because of a little smoke. I'm really all right.
[Person1]:  The floor looks super clean. Did you call the cleaning company? [Person2]:  Nope. My foot is broken. I stay at home. So I did it myself. [Person1]:  With a broken foot? Was that a good idea? [Person2]:  Don't worry, Dave. [Person1]:  You could have called Brenda. She would have done it for you. [Person2]:  I'm not asking your little sister to clean my floors, Dave. Anyway, it wasn't as hard as you think. I have been using a Roomba recently. [Person1]:  Oh, that cleaning robot? I'm jealous, Sandra. I wanted one, but I didn't have 500 extra dollars. [Person2]:  I know. They're so expensive. I got mine from my boss when I was Employee of the Year two years ago.
[Person1]:  Did you have your television repaired? [Person2]:  Yes, but not by the place you recommended [Person1]:  Why not? The repair is very good and thecharges are so reasonable. [Person2]:  That may be, but I couldn't find it. [Person1]:  But you couldn't miss it. I told you the first right after the railroad bridge. [Person2]:  I took that. I went to the end of the road. There is no such a place. [Person1]:  Wait a minute. Perhaps it is the second right. Yes. I think it is. [Person2]:  I should have known. Whenever someone says 'You can't miss it', you can be sure that you won't find it. [Person1]:  I'm really sorry for my bad memory. [Person2]:  That's OK.
[Person1]:  So that will be one teddy, two terry cloth robes, three pairs of satin slippers, and two pairs of pajamas.  [Person2]:  Does all that come to 10, 000NT?  [Person1]:  Let me see. . . yes, 15, 880NT. After the discount, your total comes to 12, 704NT. Here's your free teddy bear, free panties and your card application.  [Person2]:  Where do I sign?  [Person1]:  Right here. And write your address. You'll get the card in the mail within a week.  [Person2]:  OK.  [Person1]:  I know your friend will like the gift set, especially the teddy bear.  [Person2]:  Well, the teddy bear is for me!  [Person1]:  Remember to keep your receipt in case your friend needs to make any exchanges. There are no refunds on sale items. 
[Person1]:  Are these your triplets? They're beautiful! I've seen other babies who were nothing but skin and bones at their age. You know, they're absolutely identical of you and John! Are you planning on having any more?  [Person2]:  Bite your tongue! I'm already at the end of my rope. Some nights I don't sleep at all. John manages to sleep like a log even when the babies are screaming at the top of their lungs.  [Person1]:  Well, tell me. How was the labor and delivery?  [Person2]:  I wouldn't say that I had the time of my life but at least everything went without a hitch.  [Person1]:  Well, hang in there. In twenty years, you'll fell it was well worth it! 
[Person1]:  What do you want to do after graduation, Mary? [Person2]:  I like to go into the management. I've applied for several jobs, and already got some offers. [Person1]:  Good for you, Mary. You are always about the most hard-working student in our class and your efforts finally paid off. [Person2]:  It's so nice of you to say so, Lucas. And how about you? [Person1]:  I have to do some more studies to become a lawyer. [Person2]:  Oh, being a lawyer is not easy nowadays. And you have to overcome a lot of difficulties to achieve your ambition. [Person1]:  Definitely. But if our ambitions were so easy to achieve, we would soon get bored. [Person2]:  That's sure. But there's another story. Some people were working really hard yet not succeed. [Person1]:  That is why ambition needs to be realistic. You can't (?) too high. [Person2]:  Sounds reasonable. But according to my understanding, a careful plan in advance places the most important role in achieving success. [Person1]:  You're right. In addition, interest is the best teacher. Like a saying goes, 'You can lead a horse to river, but you can't force it to drink.' [Person2]:  I can't agree more. My father wanted me to be a surgeon when I choose my major in college. But I'm not interested in any hospital jobs. [Person1]:  A good doctor should be mentally physically strong. [Person2]:  Definitely. I don't think it's possible for me to do the surgeons' work under great pressure, so I will stick to what I'm good at. [Person1]:  How I wish our parents won't push us too much.
[Person1]:  Ella, what languages do you speak? [Person2]:  As you know Korean is my first language. I also speak English and Chinese. How about you? What languages do you speak? [Person1]:  English, German and French. While I was studying in Europe, I used French in German all the time. Now, my French is not so good but I do keep my German up. [Person2]:  How do you practice your German? [Person1]:  Oh, the man who lives next door. His name is Hines. He's from Berlin. He and I are always talking about Germany. [Person2]:  Well, all you need now is a neighbor from Paris.
[Person1]:  Hello! Tomorrow I'm going to need a wake-up call. [Person2]:  Not a problem. What time shall we call you? [Person1]:  I always hit the snooze button, so give me two calls, one at 7 and another at 7 fifteen. [Person2]:  It'll be our pleasure. We'll call you at 7 and then at 7 fifteen. [Person1]:  Oops, cancel that. Change the second call to 7 thirty will you, please? [Person2]:  No sooner said than done. Can I help you with anything else? [Person1]:  No, that's about it for now. Thanks. [Person2]:  Okay, sir. Have a pleasant evening.
[Person1]:  Can I help you, sir? [Person2]:  Uh, yes. I'm going to the States and I need some traveler's checks. [Person1]:  All right. How much do you need? [Person2]:  One thousand U. S. dollars. [Person1]:  One thousand U. S. Mm hmm. And are you going to pay cash? [Person2]:  Oh, no. I want to withdraw from my U. S. dollars savings account. [Person1]:  All right. Now can I have your passbook? [Person2]:  Right. Here it is. [Person1]:  Thank you. And what amounts do you want the checks in? [Person2]:  Mm. In hundreds, please.
[Person1]:  Where is my back pack? [Person2]:  I don't know. Where did you leave it? [Person1]:  I just put it on the chair a while ago, but now it's gone. [Person2]:  Are you sure? [Person1]:  Of course, I am sure. I bet someone stole it. [Person2]:  Well, you should have kept an eye on it.
[Person1]:  Hey John, did you register for classes yet? [Person2]:  I register this Friday. [Person1]:  What classes do you plan on taking? [Person2]:  I really want to take the communication class, but I don't know if it will be available. [Person1]:  Is that class really that popular? [Person2]:  Yeah. I tried to get in last semester, but it was full by the time I registered. [Person1]:  What other classes are you going to take? [Person2]:  I still need to take English 201, but I really don't like writing. [Person1]:  I took that class already. There is a lot of writing, but it's not that bad. [Person2]:  Oh really? Who was the instructor? There are like 4 different instructors to choose from. [Person1]:  I had Professor Mahoney. [Person2]:  Is he an easy grader? [Person1]:  I'm not sure if he is or not, but I thought he was definitely fair. [Person2]:  Do you mind if I ask you what you got? [Person1]:  Not at all. I got a 3. 8. [Person2]:  Well, what did you get in English 101 last year? [Person1]:  I got a 4. 0 in that class. [Person2]:  Well, I can't compare to you. I got a 3. 1 in English 101. That means if you got a lower grade in English 201, it must be harder. [Person1]:  It's not what it appears. I actually tried harder in the 101 class. If I put as much effort into the 201 class, I would have received the same grade. [Person2]:  Oh. That helps. Thanks.
[Person1]:  Would you honor us with a visit? [Person2]:  I'd love to. Thanks. [Person1]:  When will you be convenient? [Person2]:  Any time will suit me. [Person1]:  Are you doing anything tomorrow? [Person2]:  I'm free tomorrow. [Person1]:  I'll pick you up at about nine o'clock, will it do? [Person2]:  All right, see you then.
[Person1]:  You want to go to the movies tonight? [Person2]:  Sure! What's playing? [Person1]:  The new Twilight movie! [Person2]:  Twilight? As in the vampire movies? No way, I am watching that, but I don't understand why everyone is so excited about these films about vampires. It doesn't make sense. [Person1]:  Of course it does. It's like a modern tale of Romeo and Juliet. You can see a couple who are in love but can't be together because they are so different. And in the fact that immortality and super human strengthen this really sexy and there you have it! Plus the cast is hip, young people that make the movie even more enticing. [Person2]:  I don't buy into that. I think it's just a fad. Pretty soon this will pass and everyone will be into wear-wolves or zombies!

[Person1]:  That doesn't justify your violation. May I see your licence, please? [Person2]:  Oh, sorry, I don't have it on me. Honestly, I forgot it at the house. But I have the insurance policy with me. Here it is. [Person1]:  Well, sir, your insurance looks good, but I still have to write you a ticket. [Person2]:  I understand, officer. I guess it's just not my day today. I will accept the fine.

[Person1]:  OK, boys. It's time that you learn how to do your own laundry. Who can tell me the first thing that you need to do? [Person2]:  Separate the whites from the dark colours. [Person1]:  Good job, Matt. Now, what do you do after you put the clothes in the washer? [Person2]:  Choose the speed, size of the load and water temperature that you want. [Person1]:  Excellent, Matt. You're almost ready to do this yourself. You just forgot one thing, put in the soap, before you start the machine. Then press the start button and wait until the washer makes the short high sound. That means the cycle is complete, then what do we do? [Person2]:  Clean out the dryer and then put the clothes in it, choose the temperature level and timing and press start. [Person1]:  Good job, Matt. You sound like you're ready to go. Be sure never to leave the machines going if you're not at home and make sure to take out the clothes and fold them as soon as their dry, so they don't wrinkle. Now you can do this all by yourselves!
[Person1]:  OK, Rafael. I'm going to ask you about Sunday. What do you like to do on Sunday? [Person2]:  What do I like to do on Sunday? Well, I think it's changing every Sunday. I like to go to concerts or things like that on a sunny day. And I like to go to the cinema, too. I like to stay home when it rains, like last weekend. And I don't go out when it's too windy. [Person1]:  Well. I like reading new novels and going shopping. What time do you usually get up on Sunday? [Person2]:  Well, quite late I guess, about 10 o'clock. It's not really late, but late enough. [Person1]:  I'm an early riser, usually at 6 or 7 o'clock. What do you normally eat for breakfast on Sunday morning? [Person2]:  I guess the same thing as everyday like eggs and bread. [Person1]:  Ah, no difference. You never cook? [Person2]:  No. I like spending my time doing things like writing music. So I don't. I mean, I care what I eat. But I don't spend a lot of time preparing, so I basically eat the same thing every morning.
[Person1]:  There's one car advertisement that opens with part of a song by BjOk. [Person2]:  I've seen it. You're not sure what it's advertising to begin with, are you? I thought the silver vehicle was a spacecraft of the future. It's a bit of a let down when you realize it's just another car advertisement in the end. [Person1]:  Yes, the beginning is a bit misleading. It's funny, isn't it? Sometimes the most effective ads are the really simple ones, you know? Like a famous actor sitting down at the breakfast table with this family enjoying a particular kind of food. [Person2]:  He eats it so it must be good. That actress from Friends is advertising soap. Seeing famous people on TV can be a huge influence on us. [Person1]:  Yeah, the ads they put on TV before the World Cup use big stars too, don't they? [Person2]:  Yeah, I remember that one that had a whole team of top footballers.
[Person1]:  What are you typing there? [Person2]:  I'm working on my resume. [Person1]:  Really? Did you find any information about a new job? [Person2]:  Yeah, I just got some good information off the internet. [Person1]:  Great! Do you think you have a chance at getting the job? [Person2]:  I didn ' t just find out about one job. There were several ones that looked good. [Person1]:  Maybe I should try looking on the web for work. [Person2]:  Sure you have to be patient. But I think it ' s much less trouble to sit in front of a computer than to go door to door or to make a lot of phone calls. [Person1]:  But there must be so many people who also see the advertisement for that job on the net. You might have no chance. [Person2]:  How do you know if you don ' t have a try?
[Person1]:  Have you gotten a parking ticket before? [Person2]:  No, I haven't. What about you? [Person1]:  I got a ticket a couple of days ago. [Person2]:  What did you do? [Person1]:  I got it for parking in the red zone. [Person2]:  Why would you park in the red zone? [Person1]:  I had to run in and get something quickly. [Person2]:  Where were you at? [Person1]:  I got the ticket in front of my apartment. [Person2]:  I thought that you had your own parking spot? [Person1]:  I had to make it quick. [Person2]:  Hope it was worth it.
[Person1]:  you don't look too well. Maybe you should take the day off from work. [Person2]:  I couldn't do that. I have an important meeting to go to today. [Person1]:  do you feel ok? [Person2]:  not really. After a 12 - hour flight, I've got jetlag, and on top of that, I think I've also got the flu. [Person1]:  why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting? You should really get some seat or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now. [Person2]:  could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever? [Person1]:  you're really hot. Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down. [Person2]:  ok. I'll stay home this morning and rest, but if I feel better in the afternoon, I'm going to the meeting. [Person1]:  Zach, what's that on your arm? [Person2]:  I don't know. It looks a bit red, but I'm sure it's nothing. [Person1]:  it looks like you have a red rash all over you! Are you allergic to anything? [Person2]:  just cats, but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks. [Person1]:  I completely forgot about your cat allergy. I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago. Oh no. we'd better go to the doctor to get some medicine. Let's go. [Person2]:  shouldn't we make an appointment first? [Person1]:  we would, but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse. [Person2]:  whatever you say. I just want to get to my meeting!
[Person1]:  Hello, Tom! Do you have plans for this evening? [Person2]:  Nothing special. [Person1]:  How about having dinner with me? [Person2]:  That's great. I would love to. And when? [Person1]:  Let's fix it at seven o'clock, OK? [Person2]:  No problem. However, maybe I should come early to help you prepare the dinner. [Person1]:  Don't worry. I will arrange everything. [Person2]:  All right, see you tonight. [Person1]:  See you.

My husband is so supportive with my work and he helps around the house so much. [Person1]:  You're so lucky. I hope to get married to a guy like that. [Person2]:  I'm so happy. Even though we are both working, we get to spend a lot of time with each other in the evening and on the weekends. [Person1]:  Do you guys do anything special? [Person2]:  In the evening, we just sit and talk over dinner. But on the weekend, we try to go out to the beach or hit a nice restaurant, or go to a nice cafe.

[Person1]:  What can I do for you? [Person2]:  I've got a suit, a woolen sweater and a white shirt to wash. [Person1]:  OK, let me see. This white shirt can be washed in water with hands, but this suit and the woolen sweater should be dry-cleaned. [Person2]:  That's OK. But that must be costly. [Person1]:  Yes, the cost for dry-cleaning is three times of that for ordinary laundering. But for suits and sweaters, you can only take them to the dry cleaners'. [Person2]:  Oh, my wife just threw them into the washer. [Person1]:  Did it ever shrink or fade? Generally speaking, the dark-colored clothes always fade away gradually. [Person2]:  I see. The woolen sweater shrunk in the wash. [Person1]:  Never mind. You can leave them to me. [Person2]:  Oh, thanks. You know, I know little about this, so please tell me something that I should pay more attention to when I do washing. [Person1]:  It's very simple. Divide the clothes by the colors, and wash them in cold water. If you've got some special stains on them like sugar, coffee or something else please let the dry cleaner know. [Person2]:  I'll keep that in mind. And how much is it altogether? [Person1]:  That will be 80 Yuan altogether. Here is your invoice.
[Person1]:  Good afternoon. How can I help you? [Person2]:  Good afternoon. My name is Monica. I am here for the job interview at 2 PM.

I would like to make sure you all know the process. The interview consists of three parts. One, all of the interviewees will answer the question there and lasts for maximum one hour.

In which, you have a small interview with your future manager. [Person2]:  What about the 3rd round? [Person1]:  Good question. But I will tell you when you pass the first two.
[Person1]:  Good evening, sir, ma'am. A table for two? [Person2]:  No, thank you. But we have a small problem. Can you help us? [Person1]:  Sure. [Person2]:  We are looking for a hotel. Are there any hotels near here? [Person1]:  Yes. The nearest one is next to the bank. It's quite modern. [Person2]:  Do you think there're any cheap ones nearby? [Person1]:  Yes. Drive west for about two minutes and you will find one opposite to a supermarket. It's a family hotel, very comfortable, and the price is quite reasonable. [Person2]:  It sounds nice. Thank you very much for your help. [Person1]:  That's all right.
[Person1]:  Hi. Thanks for coming to the interview today. It's nice to meet you. [Person2]:  Well, thank you. [Person1]:  To begin with, why don't you tell us a little about yourself? [Person2]:  Okay. Um, yeah. I've always been interested in teaching in a language program like this, and uh, I graduated with a degree in English and psychology eight years ago, [ Oh, really, both? ]. Yeah, and uh then I landed my first job overseas in Japan. [Person1]:  Oh, wow. That's pretty impressive. What did you do there? What kind of work? [Person2]:  Well, I worked full time, um, for a private language school in Tokyo for the first two years, and then I found a job at a community college. [Person1]:  Oh really? So, exactly what did you do in your work there then? [Person2]:  Well, I taught English and, uh, culinary arts. [Person1]:  You taught cooking classes? [Person2]:  Well, well, I know it sounds like an unusual combination, but I completed a program in culinary arts before I got my, uh, English and psychology degrees. [Person1]:  Oh, Wow. You've done a lot, haven't you? [ Yeah. ] So, what exactly, um, how did you teach and what exactly did you do? [Person2]:  Well, um, many of my students wanted to become chefs in restaurants, or they wanted to start their own restaurants, uh, and in our area, there were many, uh, tourists tourist spots. A lot of tourists came to that particular area, and so with English, they would be able to communicate not only with suppliers, you know things that they need for restaurant's food and so forth, but also with their customers, and so I taught them English and cooking at the same time. [Person1]:  Wow. That's, that's pretty impressive. That's interesting. [ ... and tasty. ] Oh, I bet. So, why did you return to the United States? How long have you been back? [Person2]:  I've been back for, uh, probably about a year now. [Person1]:  Okay, so what brought you back then? [Person2]:  Well, one of my former students opened a sushi restaurant, uh, in town, and he asked me to work with him. [Person1]:  Really? What's the name of the restaurant? [Person2]:  Well, it's called Flying Sushi. Have you ever heard of it? [Person1]:  Yes, I've been there. Their food is fabulous; it's top-notch. It's really hard just to get a reservation there. [Person2]:  I know, and uh, well, I work there two weeknights, and uh, and then ... [Person1]:  So, two nights a week you're working there still? [Person2]:  Right, right, but then, but ... I want to return to teaching. I've also been working as a therapist at a treatment center for teenagers struggling with depression and other mental health disorders. [Person1]:  Oh, wow, that would be a really interesting job. [Person2]:  It is, it is. [Person1]:  Wow. You have such a wide range of experience. Uh, you know, to be honest, we have fifteen people who are applying for this position. You've got quite a background, but why don't you tell me three reasons why you would be the best person for this job. [Person2]:  Um, well, first of all, uh, I understand that different students have different learning styles, and for that reason, I have used iPads, video, music, cooking, drama, role plays, and games to reach every student. [ That's good. ] And second, I have a background in academic and psychological counseling and advising [ Uh, huh ] ... skills that are often needed, you know, in working with international students. [Person1]:  Yeah, that could be really useful. [Person2]:  Yeah, so you know, many of them struggle with, uh, emotional turmoil, you know, home sickness .... [Person1]:  Yeah, coming to a new place ... [Person2]:  Right, so making the transition can be very overwhelming, and uh ... [Person1]:  Good. So, what would you say would be a third reason? [Person2]:  And finally, I speak four different languages .... [Person1]:  Four? Wow! What languages do you speak? [Person2]:  Well, I speak Spanish, Portuguese, and Japanese at an advanced level. [ At an advanced level? Wow. ] And I also speak Arabic at a high-intermediate level. [Person1]:  That's very, very impressive. You do have an impressive resume. [Person2]:  Thank you. [Person1]:  Uh, what we're doing ... we're going to have two rounds of interviews, and we will contact you on Friday and let you know whether or not you'll be coming back for the second round of interviews. [Person2]:  Okay. [Person1]:  It's been really nice meeting you, and thank you for your time.
[Person1]:  Hi, dear, do you know what the important day is today?  [Person2]:  I don't know.  [Person1]:  Please think it over.  [Person2]:  Oh, I see.  [Person1]:  Come on, dear. I know you mustn't forget it.  [Person2]:  It's Saturday, a great weekend.  [Person1]:  Ur, you really let me down.  [Person2]:  Don't be angry with me. I have a bad memory.  [Person1]:  No, you haven't. You just don't care about me. You're an indifferent husband.  [Person2]:  What day is it on earth?  [Person1]:  It's the anniversary of our weeding. 
[Person1]:  Hi. I'm looking for some good deals on produce.  [Person2]:  You might want to try the mangoes.  [Person1]:  Can you describe a mango to me?  [Person2]:  It's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit. It has a big seed in it.  [Person1]:  Do I eat the seed?  [Person2]:  Maybe some animals eat the seed, but humans don't. You'd have to soak it for 10 years.  [Person1]:  What's the price of these mangoes?  [Person2]:  Today you get a 50-percent discount. They're only $1 each.  [Person1]:  Tell me what they taste like.  [Person2]:  Their flesh is soft and juicy. It has a citrus taste. It's sweet.  [Person1]:  Do I need to buy them ripe, or will they ripen at home?  [Person2]:  Just press into it gently with your thumb. If it feels soft, it's ready to eat.  [Person1]:  Where do mangoes come from?  [Person2]:  These are from Guatemala, but we're going to start getting mangoes from India. 
[Person1]:  Can I help you, Miss? [Person2]:  No, thanks, I'm just looking. How much is that necklace? [Person1]:  2,999 dollars. [Person2]:  Too expensive! My sister's birthday is tomorrow. I'm thinking what I should buy for her. [Person1]:  You'll find that the prices of our goods are quite reasonable. [Person2]:  Well, that's certainly nice to know. I'll take it. [Person1]:  It's a good choice. I'm sure she'll love it. Cash or card, Miss? [Person2]:  I hope so. Card, please. [Person1]:  That comes to 3,199 dollars with tax. Please sign here.
[Person1]:  The restaurant across the street hired a new Chinese chef, so I ordered some Chinese food there for this evening. [Person2]:  Good. I love Chinese food. What did you order? [Person1]:  Something hot and spicy. They look very inviting on the menu. You are going to love them. [Person2]:  Maybe we can find a place to learn some Chinese cooking. I hear there's a place in Chinatown where you can take some courses. Are you interested? [Person1]:  I'm not sure. I don't enjoy cooking that much. As long as we can order it from a restaurant, we don't have to learn to do it by ourselves. [Person2]:  You are right. But I just want to know how they prepare food and make it taste so different.
[Person1]:  I need to find a new furniture set for my living room. [Person2]:  Where are you going to find one? [Person1]:  I have no idea. [Person2]:  Do you want to know where I bought mine? [Person1]:  Where did you get it from? [Person2]:  I got it from IKEA. [Person1]:  How much did it cost you? [Person2]:  It cost me a couple thousand for the whole set. [Person1]:  Is the furniture sturdy? [Person2]:  The furniture is built extremely well. [Person1]:  I don't mind paying a lot as long as the quality is good. [Person2]:  Well, trust me. The quality is fantastic.
[Person1]:  I may go grocery shopping later. [Person2]:  We need to get food? [Person1]:  I don't think we have any food. [Person2]:  What are you going to buy? [Person1]:  What food are we out of? [Person2]:  Go and look in the kitchen. [Person1]:  Could you look for me? [Person2]:  You should just get the basics. [Person1]:  What would that be? [Person2]:  Get some eggs, milk, and bread. [Person1]:  Would you please make a list for me? [Person2]:  Okay, I'll write it down for you.
[Person1]:  Well, your qualifications for the job are excellent. And is there anything you'd like to ask about the job? [Person2]:  Yes, I'd like to know if the company provides opportunities for further education. [Person1]:  Yes, our employees are allowed to take up 2 days a month to attend college courses. [Person2]:  That's very generous. [Person1]:  I've enjoyed the conversation with you. We'll call you within 5 working days. [Person2]:  Thank you. I appreciate the time you've given to me.
[Person1]:  How may I help you. sir? [Person2]:  I'm wondering if anyone has turned in a train ticket. I just lost my ticket for Beijing tonight. [Person1]:  Let me see. I'm sorry. Nothing's been turned in. Do you want to buy another one? [Person2]:  Yes. If I don't make it to Beijing tomorrow morning. my wife would kill me. How much does it cost? [Person1]:  150 yuan for hard seats. [Person2]:  Fine. [Person1]:  Sir? [Person2]:  Where is my wallet? Someone has stolen my wallet!
[Person1]:  It looks like we are going to have a shower at any minute now. [Person2]:  I think so too. Isn't strange how you can sense it? [Person1]:  I know what you mean. [Person2]:  Look at the clouds in the sky. Whenever they seem dark and low like this, you know it's going to rain, or look at the object that's far away, if it seems clear to you, it's probably going to pour. [Person1]:  Yes. And everything seems to have a stronger smell to me then. [Person2]:  I know, and people often say it's going to rain when they have aches and pains in certain parts of their body. My mother always complains that her knee hurts just before a storm. [Person1]:  And have you noticed how the animals react before a storm? [Person2]:  Sure, horses and cows will seem to go a protected area and huddle together. [Person1]:  Yah, but with all these sensible signs, how come we aren't carrying our umbrella with us now?
[Person1]:  Good morning! What can I do for you, Madam? [Person2]:  Good morning! I'm looking for a coat. [Person1]:  What color would you like? [Person2]:  Could you show me some? I'd like a middle sized red coat. [Person1]:  Sorry. We haven't anything in your size. [Person2]:  Do you have a smaller size? [Person1]:  I'm sorry. The small size coats have just been sold out. What about the blue one? It looks nice and maybe fits you. [Person2]:  Well, may I try it on? [Person1]:  Yes, please. [Person2]:  It seems nice on me. How much is it? [Person1]:  168 yuan. [Person2]:  OK. Here is 170 yuan. You keep the change please! [Person1]:  Thanks.
[Person1]:  It's so relaxing, taking a walk in the country. The air is so fresh and clean.  [Person2]:  would you like to live in the country? I'm not sure I'd like it.  [Person1]:  I can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage. The problem is that, for me, each advantage has its own disadvantage.  [Person2]:  What do you mean?  [Person1]:  Well, I hate the noise in the city, but I love being around lost of people. The problem is that you can't have lots of people and have peace and quiet. The two just don't go together.  [Person2]:  I see what you mean. I love being far away from a city, but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities.  [Person1]:  People can't have it both ways. If you live in the country, it is often less convenient. If you live in a city, it is noisy, but there's more to do.  [Person2]:  I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams. They're so much better to look at than concrete, rows of parked cars and tall buildings.  [Person1]:  I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face. When the wind blows in the city, you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes.  [Person2]:  The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing. There's so sign of pollution. The village looks so peaceful.  [Person1]:  Just remember that in that village there's nothing to do. There's not even a pub or restaurant. There's just one small shop with a poor selection of goods.  [Person2]:  You're right. I would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends. I would hate living in the country! 
[Person1]:  Good morning. Are you ready to order?  [Person2]:  Yes, I am, thank you. I'll have three scrambled eggs with country ham, toast and jam, please.  [Person1]:  Would you like anything to drink?  [Person2]:  I'll have a tomato juice and some iced tea.  [Person1]:  Anything else?  [Person2]:  Could I have a slice of pumpkin pie?  [Person1]:  Sure. Coming right up. 
[Person1]:  What do you want for breakfast? [Person2]:  Well, I'm hungry, anything will do, and we've got a lot of sightseeing to do. So, let's decide what will see today first. [Person1]:  Sounds good to me. [Person2]:  Well, I guess the best place to start is the cathedral and then the castle. What are the opening times for those 2? [Person1]:  Well, according to this guide book, the cathedral is open morning and afternoon. The castle is just open from 1 [Person2]:  What else should we see? [Person1]:  I really want to spend some time in the art museum, because they have got this wonderful painting by Van Gogh. I've always wanted to have a look. [Person2]:  Ok, well, that'll be more than enough for today, then tomorrow let's go to the flower garden and have a picnic.
[Person1]:  Here ' s my passport. I'm a visiting scholar. [Person2]:  Do you have anything to declare? [Person1]:  No, these are all my personal effects. [Person2]:  What's in the bag? Would you mind opening the bag? [Person1]:  Not at all. I don't know what's dutiable. Do I have to pay duty on things for my own use? [Person2]:  NO. You don't have to pay duty on personal belongings. [Person1]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  How about another beer? [Person2]:  No, thanks. I've had more than enough. In fact, I must be running along. [Person1]:  Stay around for a while. The party is warming up. [Person2]:  I'm afraid I have to leave. I have to be up early tomorrow.
[Person1]:  I have redecorated my bedroom. I decide to repaint the walls and change the pictures. I also bought a new pair of curtains. What do you think of it? [Person2]:  I think is looks great. I really like the light colors you have chosen. The pictures are nice too. Did you buy any new furniture? [Person1]:  I bought a new mattress and some fresh bedclothes. I also bought a new dressing table and a new bedside table. [Person2]:  New furniture makes a room seem so fresh. I see that you also bought a new lamp for your bedside table. [Person1]:  Do you think that I should get a new wardrobe? [Person2]:  That wardrobe looks quite big. Is it full of clothes? [Person1]:  Yes. I have so many clothes stuffed into it. Perhaps I should get rid of some of them. There are clothes in there that I never wear anymore. [Person2]:  I like to get rid of clothes that I don't wear rather than keeping them in a wardrobe. They take up too much space. There are several charity shops that you can give old clothes to. They will be happy to receive them as long as they are in reasonable condition. [Person1]:  That's a good idea. After I get rid of the old clothes I no longer wear, I can see what new clothes I need to buy. [Person2]:  I need to buy some new clothes for the summer too. Perhaps we can go together one day. [Person1]:  Ok. I'll let you know when I'Ve sorted out my clothes.
[Person1]:  Li Lei, can you tell me what the origin of Easter is? [Person2]:  The Bible says that Jesus Christ was resurrected three days after he was crucified. People commemorate that at a festival called Easter. [Person1]:  Oh, then when do you celebrate Easter? [Person2]:  We celebrate it on the first Sunday after a full moon on or after the 21st of March. [Person1]:  How do you celebrate it? [Person2]:  We make a lot of Easter eggs and then paint some designs on them. We'll also go to church and pray. [Person1]:  That sounds interesting.
[Person1]:  Hello, Tom. How do you find the dinner of yesterday? [Person2]:  Very good. That may be the most delicious food I have ever eaten. [Person1]:  It's nice of you to say so. [Person2]:  I really appreciate you for having invited me. [Person1]:  Don't mention it. You know, we're old friends. [Person2]:  Anyway, I owe you one. Are you free tonight? [Person1]:  Yes. Why? [Person2]:  I want to invite you to enjoy the food I cook. [Person1]:  That's great. I'd love to.
[Person1]:  Hi. Ed, what's up? [Person2]:  Nothing. [Person1]:  Doesn't look like it to me. [Person2]:  Just get out of my face! [Person1]:  Woo, easy. [Person2]:  Leave me alone! [Person1]:  What are you so ticked off about? [Person2]:  I don't want to talk about it. [Person1]:  Maybe I could help. [Person2]:  I blew the finally exam. [Person1]:  You've got be joking. [Person2]:  No, I'm not. [Person1]:  Well, don't get bend on a ship about it.
[Person1]:  Mr. Sharp, thank you for giving me this interview. So, my first question is, are you happy with your life? [Person2]:  Am I happy? You may know you are the first person to have asked me this question directly. The others dared not because they were afraid I might say yes. They wanted me to say no so that they could make up stories about me. [Person1]:  What kind of stories? [Person2]:  Brian Sharpe, author of over 100 historical novels, lives in a lonely house 30 miles away from Sydney. But is he happy? [Person1]:  Is that why you have refused many interviews? [Person2]:  I'm tired of being told that I must be unhappy because I'm rich and successful. I'm not unhappy. [Person1]:  Understood. And I'm wondering if you follow a similar pattern of writing. [Person2]:  I know what you mean. Do I write similar stories? I say no. [Person1]:  So, how do you create your heroes? [Person2]:  My heroes live? They think for themselves. All their stories are drawn from life, my life, my friends' lives, including my friends in many books. [Person1]:  Sounds good to me.
[Person1]:  Hi Mark. [Person2]:  Hi. [Person1]:  What are you planning to do today? [Person2]:  I'm not sure yet. [Person1]:  Would you like to have lunch with me? [Person2]:  Yes. When? [Person1]:  Is 11 [Person2]:  Sorry, I didn't hear you. Can you say that again please? [Person1]:  I said, 11 [Person2]:  Oh, I'm busy then. Can we meet a little later? [Person1]:  OK, how about 12 [Person2]:  OK. Where? [Person1]:  How about Bill's Seafood Restaurant? [Person2]:  Oh, Where is that? [Person1]:  It's on 7th Street. [Person2]:  OK, I'll meet you there.
[Person1]:  Shall we for go out for a meal this evening? [Person2]:  I don't really mind. [Person1]:  We can go to that new Chinese restaurant. [Person2]:  I suppose I could. [Person1]:  Come on, let's try it. [Person2]:  All right. If you really want to.
[Person1]:  Our current apartment is valued at RMB 700, 000. We can sell it and put that money towards buying the new apartment. [Person2]:  Yeah, but we still need RMB 500, 000. Maybe we can use some of our savings to pay part of it. [Person1]:  And we can take out a loan to pay the rest. [Person2]:  Great, so we can afford the new apartment after all! [Person1]:  Uh huh. . . but we're going to have to cut back on our shopping from now on.
[Person1]:  Hey, don't walk on the lawn. [Person2]:  Sorry, I'm looking for my wallet. [Person1]:  You lost your wallet? Anything important in it? [Person2]:  Yes. A lot of cash. Almost forty thousand pounds. [Person1]:  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I think you'd better talk to the police officer walking there. [Person2]:  It seems that is a better way. Thank you. [Person1]:  You are welcome.
[Person1]:  We have been here for about five days and I have to leave now. [Person2]:  Ok! You know you're always welcome here. Did you enjoy your stay? [Person1]:  Yes, we have a very pleasant time. Thank you for being so nice for us. [Person2]:  It's our pleasure. And is there anything else we can do for you before you leave here? [Person1]:  No, thanks. You've done a lot for us. Thank you for everything. [Person2]:  Don't mention it. Oh, This is a small gift for you. [Person1]:  Oh! Thank you! It's very kind of you. [Person2]:  We hope you could visit our company again. [Person1]:  We're sure we will. And welcome to our corporation next year. We're expecting you. [Person2]:  Ok! We'll definitely go to visit your company.
[Person1]:  Yes, Sir. You called? [Person2]:  Yes, I wonder if you could bring me another bottle of beer. [Person1]:  Certainly. Would you like anything else? [Person2]:  Well, my grandson is supposed to meet me in London at the airport. Do you think he'll be able to find me? [Person1]:  I'm sure he will. You don't have to worry about that. Are you going to be visiting him? [Person2]:  Yes. I've never seen my grandson. [Person1]:  I think you'll have a wonderful time in London. It's beautiful, is this your first time abroad? [Person2]:  No, I saw quite a bit of Europe before, Rome, Berlin, Paris, places like that, but I've never been to London. [Person1]:  Oh, then you have flown before too. [Person2]:  No, that was during the Second World War and I went to Europe on a large ship carrying soldiers. [Person1]:  Things are quite different in Europe nowadays. [Person2]:  I'm sure they are. I'm really interested to get there. [Person1]:  Well, it's 4 [Person2]:  I plan to stay five weeks. I was a teacher but I have stopped working. My wife has dead and so I can go wherever I want. [Person1]:  I think you'll have a good time. I'll go and get a beer for you.
[Person1]:  Hello Tom, do you mean your going away? [Person2]:  Oh yes, I've booked the ticket and it's time for me to go back home. [Person1]:  Well, how long have you been in China? [Person2]:  I've been here for 2 years. [Person1]:  Did you enjoy your stay? [Person2]:  Yes, indeed. I should say. I've had a wonderful time over the past 2 years. You and Xiao Fang have given me a lot of help. People here are very friendly. Thank you all very much. [Person1]:  When are you leaving? [Person2]:  I'm off next Sunday. I've come to say goodbye today. [Person1]:  I'd like to invite you to dinner before you go. What about Friday? [Person2]:  I'm free on Friday. I'd like to come. Would you please ask Xiao Fang to be there, too? [Person1]:  Of course I will.
[Person1]:  Sarah, what did you do today?  [Person2]:  I went shopping.  [Person1]:  Did you buy anything?  [Person2]:  Yes, I bought a few things.  [Person1]:  What did you buy?  [Person2]:  I bought this coat. Do you like it?  [Person1]:  Yeah, I like it a lot. It's very pretty. Where did you buy it?  [Person2]:  At the mall on 5th street.  [Person1]:  Was it expensive?  [Person2]:  No, it wasn't expensive. It was on sale for 20 dollars.  [Person1]:  That's cheap.  [Person2]:  I know. It was a really good deal.  [Person1]:  I don't think you'll need to wear it for a while. It's been really hot lately. 
[Person1]:  What's your schedule like this year?  [Person2]:  Pretty busy. I have to pick up a lot of credits this year.  [Person1]:  What's your major?  [Person2]:  I'm majoring in French literature.  [Person1]:  Oh, don't you have to take that class on 18th century poetry? It's really difficult. I hear the students in that class have to write a paper 100 pages long.  [Person2]:  That's right. We got the assignment last week.  [Person1]:  When is it due?  [Person2]:  Next Monday!  [Person1]:  Remind me never to sign up for that course! 
[Person1]:  Hey Mike. What are you doing tonight?  [Person2]:  Nothing planned. How about you?  [Person1]:  Work is kicking my ass. I'm so stressed. Let's go grab a drink.  [Person2]:  I'm always up for a drink. To tell you the truth, it's been quite stressful here too.  [Person1]:  I say we get drunk tonight. I don't want to think about all this stuff.  [Person2]:  But we have to work tomorrow.  [Person1]:  We won't stay out too late. I just need to forget about work.  [Person2]:  I hear ya. Let's do it. 
[Person1]:  I hate it when footballers spit on the football pitch during a game. It's disgusting. I wonder why they do it?  [Person2]:  I've no idea, but spitting is common in many countries.  [Person1]:  Isn't impolite and unsanitary?  [Person2]:  It's certainly unsanitary. There are many customs in other countries that may seem strange to us. For example, in Thailand, you should never touch someone on the head.  [Person1]:  Interesting. I know that in some countries, you shouldn't blow your noise in front of other people.  [Person2]:  I think that's a good custom. I hate it when people do that.  [Person1]:  A common habit that I hate is chewing whit you mouth open. Luckily, adults rarely do it. Is seems that kids grow out of it.  [Person2]:  Do you often scratch your head when you are thinking?  [Person1]:  Yes, I do. I wonder why people do that? Oh look, I'm doing it now!  [Person2]:  I rub my chin when I'm thinking. My mother scratches her nose.  [Person3]:   [Person2]:  Oh, the eyes-definitely. I really think you can tell a lot about a person's personality from their eyes.  [Person1]:  I agree. Which part of the body do you find least attractive?  [Person2]:  The feet! Why are people's feet so ugly?  [Person1]:  I don't know, but according to this magazine survey, most people agree with you that the feet are the most unattractive part of the body and that eyes are the most attractive.  [Person2]:  Really? What else does the survey say? 
[Person1]:  Excuse me, my seat is next to yours. [Person2]:  Are you also taking this flight to London? [Person1]:  Yes. Are you going to London on business? [Person2]:  No, I'm going to Glasgow to visit my son. He studying in Glasgow University. Are you going to study in Britain? [Person1]:  Yes, I'm studying in Saint Johns College in Cambridge over the coming 2 years. [Person2]:  That's wonderful. Is this your first trip abroad? [Person1]:  Yes, actually this is my first by air. That's why I'm a bit nervous. [Person2]:  Well, relax. There's nothing to worry about.
[Person1]:  Good morning. Can I help you? [Person2]:  Yes, please. I'd like some eggs. [Person1]:  Eggs? OK. How many, please? [Person2]:  12, please. [Person1]:  Here you are. Anything else? [Person2]:  Yes, do you have any green tea here? [Person1]:  Yes, how much do you want? [Person2]:  Could I have half a kilo? [Person1]:  Certainly. Here you are. [Person2]:  How much are all these things? [Person1]:  Let me see. 14 yuan, please. [Person2]:  Here is the money. Thank you.
[Person1]:  Hi. Have you got a personal computer? [Person2]:  Certainly. What's the matter? [Person1]:  I wonder if you often trade with others on the internet. [Person2]:  Sure. I often buy things or do business through it without going out to the physical stores. [Person1]:  Great! It's just like viewless stores. But how can you shop or order on line or trade on line? [Person2]:  That's simple. Just click the hyperlink, www. taobao. com or www. ebay. com, and you can see the specimen of the goods shown on the screen, and then you can place an order online with the sales company. And the goods will be delivered to your place. [Person1]:  Is the service charged? [Person2]:  No. it's free. [Person1]:  Really. I'll get a computer at once.
[Person1]:  Hello, can I help you? [Person2]:  Yes. I'm looking for something to wear to a formal party. [Person1]:  What dress size do you wear? [Person2]:  Medium, a woman's size 10 or 12. [Person1]:  This dress is the latest fashion form Paris. It's made of pure silk. And this silk blouse would go with this skirt. Do you like it? [Person2]:  Yes. [Person1]:  Why don't you try it on and see how you feel about it? [Person2]:  That's a great idea. I'll try it on. [Person1]:  How does that feel? [Person2]:  It feels very good. [Person1]:  You look wonderful. [Person2]:  Okay. I'll take it. Thank you very much. [Person1]:  You're welcome.
[Person1]:  I'm afraid it's a bad news for you. There are some problems in your supervised goods. [Person2]:  Oh, no! How did this happen. Are you sure? [Person1]:  I overheard this information when I passed Arden's office. We got some complaints from consumers yesterday. I am terribly sorry for that. [Person2]:  My God! I actually checked them one by one. How could this be? [Person1]:  Calm down! It is useless to act like that. Can we find some solutions? [Person2]:  What kind of solution can I have now? I nearly go crazy now. [Person1]:  But we still have to find one. Can we find Arden to check whether this is true or not? [Person2]:  It seems that I have nothing to do, except this. [Person1]:  Face the reality. Maybe we can find the way to make up the loss.
[Person1]:  how was your day? [Person2]:  let's start with you. How was yours? [Person1]:  it was really busy. I had to work straight through my lunch break. [Person2]:  did you get to leave early then? [Person1]:  my boss told me that I could either go home early or take a long lunch break another day, so I decided to wait and take a long lunch break another time. [Person2]:  it was nice of your boss to give you an option. My boss would never do that. [Person1]:  let's get back to you. How was your day? [Person2]:  it was horrible! It was just one thing after another. [Person1]:  you look pretty upset. Are you ok? [Person2]:  I'm fine. But I have bad news. [Person1]:  what's that? [Person2]:  I got sacked today. [Person1]:  you're kidding! How did that happen? [Person2]:  well, I was late to work today. It was the third time I was late this week. [Person1]:  how late were you? [Person2]:  only about 5 minutes. [Person1]:  you got fired for being a few minutes late? [Person2]:  my boss is really picky about that. He never arrives late, usually works over-time, and always gets his work done on time. [Person1]:  oh well. You never really liked your boss anyway, did you?
[Person1]:  Is there anything I can do for you? [Person2]:  Yes, I'd like to buy a color TV. [Person1]:  We carry products from three large manufacturers and some imported ones, too. Do you have a specific model in mind? [Person2]:  No. Which one do you recommend? [Person1]:  This one from Sony gives a very sharp picture. [Person2]:  Thank you, but I'd prefer to buy a China-made set. [Person1]:  Which brand do you prefer? [Person2]:  Sky worth. [Person1]:  OK. Come with me, please.
[Person1]:  Good morning! May I help you? [Person2]:  Yes. My wife and I are interested in renting a house for the summer. [Person1]:  Do you want a furnished house or an unfurnished one? [Person2]:  Furnished. [Person1]:  Very well. How long do you want the house? All summer? [Person2]:  No, not all summer. Just for six weeks. [Person1]:  I'm afraid I can only rent it for two months. [Person2]:  My holiday is only six weeks, but I think my brother and his family would take it for the other two weeks. Is the house in good condition? [Person1]:  Yes, it is. It was just painted and it has all the modern conveniences.
[Person1]:  Hey, Mr. Brown. How are you? Look at that smile on your face! [Person2]:  Recently it's been pretty good, actually. [Person1]:  That's what we like to hear, a profitable business. [Person2]:  Well, yes. Thanks, there's no trouble at the moment. [Person1]:  So, what can I do for you today? Are you needing to withdraw or transfer? [Person2]:  I'm going to need a Deposit Certification, to handle the affairs related to home. [Person1]:  Oh, domestic things? Yes, of course, we can help you with that.
[Person1]:  Janice, do you still remember how our filing system works? [Person2]:  Yes, I have read the Filling Instruction carefully, since you showed me it last week. [Person1]:  Very good. What is the essence of filing, do you know? [Person2]:  The essence of filing I remember is to bring together in a single folder or file all papers relating to a particular subject. And outgoing and incoming letters are kept in this file cabinet. [Person1]:  Yes, 'One customer--one file'is essential. And remember to update them timely. [Person2]:  And each file should be named clearly, either in block capitals or in jet black typed capitals. [Person1]:  Correct. [Person2]:  A card index is very important in the filing system. It is a most helpful friend to a secretary, so it must be kept handy and up to date. [Person1]:  Yes, prompt and careful filing contributes greatly to the efficiency of our office.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, Dr. Tyler, your secretary said I should come right in. [Person2]:  Please do, Jenny. How can I help you? [Person1]:  I need to get your signature on my schedule card here, on the line above advisor's approval. [Person2]:  Sure, but let's look at it over together first. How many courses do you have here? [Person1]:  Six. [Person2]:  Six? That's quite a heavy load. Any particular reason? [Person1]:  I had to drop my chemistry course last semester when I was in the hospital, so I need to take it again. [Person2]:  So you've already learnt a lot of the material. [Person1]:  Right. And calculus is a part of the second year requirement. [Person2]:  Let's see, chemistry, calculus. Oh, I see you'll be in my seminar on the modem American novel. [Person1]:  Yes, I'm looking forward to it and the romantic poetry seminar, too. [Person2]:  Two seminars? That is rather a lot. Can you handle the work? [Person1]:  I think so. The introductory economics is very easy and so is the music course. [Person2]:  Well, then I'll be happy to sign the card. However, I insist that you come see me after the first week of classes so we can make sure this isn't too much for you. [Person1]:  That's a promise.
[Person1]:  Here's some dancing. See those guys stomping, clapping and shouting? They're practicing step-dancing.  [Person2]:  It sounds cool. The rhythms look really difficult.  [Person1]:  They basically turn their bodies into drums. There's a national step competition every year.  [Person2]:  Well, black people are supposed to be great dancers.  [Person1]:  Wen! That's only a stereotype. Like all Asians are supposed to be math geniuses. I'm not a great dancer, and you said you failed calculus.  [Person2]:  Ha-ha! You got me there! 
[Person1]:  Are you busy this week? [Person2]:  Yes. This morning I need to write a business report and this afternoon at 1 [Person1]:  What's your schedule for tomorrow? [Person2]:  I'm attending the sales meeting at 9 o'clock and in the afternoon at 3 [Person1]:  What about Wednesday? [Person2]:  I've got an appointment at 8 [Person1]:  The conference is on Thursday, right? [Person2]:  Oh, yes. At 10 o'clock in the morning and 2 o'clock in the afternoon. After the conference, I'll be free. I'll be enjoying my weekend in Hong Kong.
[Person1]:  Hey, dad, I have just been given this project at school. Do you think you can help me out? [Person2]:  Sure, what's this project about? [Person1]:  Well, I should interview someone that I admire about their jobs. [Person2]:  Well, I am an expert when it comes to my job. Accounting is a respectable job and one that I am always happy to talk about. [Person1]:  Dad, I know how much you love your job. It isn't that I don't admire you. But what I was hoping actually was that you could speak to Mr. Chung, your diving friend, and see if he would agree to an interview. Diving for a living sounds cool. [Person2]:  I see. That's a great idea. You know how I really dislike talking about myself again and again for too long. Let me give David Chung a call right now and find out. [Person1]:  Thanks, dad. I know this will be a wonderful project.
[Person1]:  Good morning, May. Good girl, you are reading English books again. [Person2]:  Good morning. There is no reason to miss so beautiful a morning. Is that a new bird? [Person1]:  Oh, yes, my daughter bought it yesterday. We call her Lulu. [Person2]:  It looks so cute. Is it a parrot? [Person1]:  Yes. Just look at her colorful feathers. What else can it be? [Person2]:  I see. It's interesting that there is also a parrot in my English book. His mane is Polly. [Person1]:  Really? A foreign parrot! [Person2]:  He can speak English, too. [Person1]:  Maybe you can teach Lulu some English words. [Person2]:  Lulu. Lulu. Say hello. hello. Oh, she is so smart. Good bird.
[Person1]:  I just received a beautiful Mother's Day gift from our son. [Person2]:  What did he give you this year? [Person1]:  He drew a picture and wrote I love you on it, it was really moving. It's hard to believe he's already 9 years old now. Do you want to have a look at the picture? [Person2]:  Oh yes, please. [Person1]:  Here, isn't he good at drawing? [Person2]:  That's amazing. I really didn't know he control so well. He really has a gift for it. [Person1]:  What do you think about having him attended drawing class? [Person2]:  That's a really good idea. [Person1]:  Do you know any good teachers who control well? [Person2]:  You know, my friend David's sister Sarah is an art teacher. Naturally, she draws pictures for children's books. I'll call and find out if Jim can join her class. [Person1]:  OK.
[Person1]:  Good morning. May I speak to Mister Smith, please? [Person2]:  Speaking. [Person1]:  This is the front desk. I'm afraid that the heating in your room needs repairing, we would like to request you to change your room. We're terribly sorry for the inconvenience. [Person2]:  Ok, but I'm going out in about half an hour. [Person1]:  What time will you be back? [Person2]:  Around 8 [Person1]:  Then we would repair the heating while you are out. You may pick up your new room key, number 601 from the front desk when you return. [Person2]:  Ok. [Person1]:  Thank you very much, Sir.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, miss. I'm a transit passenger for Flight No. 207. Can you tell me where to go? [Person2]:  Let me see. Your plane leaves from Gate 12. You should go to Gate 12 to board your plane [Person1]:  Where's Gate 12? [Person2]:  Take the escalator over there and turn left, you'll see the sign. [Person1]:  Thank you very much.
[Person1]:  Daniel, would you like to have a look at my dorm? [Person2]:  Of course, I'd like to. [Person1]:  It is a small room, just for 4 people. [Person2]:  What is in it? [Person1]:  It only has 4 beds and 4 writing desks, but it is spacious and bright. [Person2]:  Do you get along with your roommates? [Person1]:  Of course. They are very friendly. [Person2]:  Which floor are you on? [Person1]:  We are on the 5th floor, and there's a very nice view from the balcony. [Person2]:  Oh, you can climb the stairs as a workout. [Person1]:  Yes, that's a good idea. [Person2]:  Wow, your roommates are cleaning the room. [Person1]:  Let's give them a hand.
[Person1]:  Gino, do you really need to go? [Person2]:  Yeah, it's must for me. [Person1]:  But don't forget to give me a ring. [Person2]:  I won't, mom. [Person1]:  Take care of yourself. [Person2]:  I will. Bye, mom. [Person1]:  Bye, my boy.
[Person1]:  Mr.  [Person2]:  Do we have to type out our homework? [Person1]:  Mr.  [Person2]:  Is there anything else? [Person1]:  Mr.  [Person2]:  We are allowed to use a calculator in class? [Person1]:  Mr. 
[Person1]:  What do you think are the main causes of war today? [Person2]:  I'd say the main reason is poverty. Countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little. If their neighbors have some resources, they try to steal them by military force. [Person1]:  It seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars. People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country. [Person2]:  Several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years. It seems they will never end. [Person1]:  How do you think they could be ended? [Person2]:  I don't think that there is any easy way. The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country. At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate. The thing is to find the real problem form the war and solve that. [Person1]:  So, if the cause is poverty, there should be a program to make the country richer. If the problem is resources, share them. [Person2]:  It sounds easy when you say it like that. In reality, it's harder to make peace between countries. [Person1]:  Yes. It is. One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support. Wars are very expensive. [Person2]:  The problem is that many poor people might suffer.
[Person1]:  Did you feed the puppies today? [Person2]:  Yes, I have. [Person1]:  That's good! Just make sure to bathe them later. [Person2]:  No problem. I can do that for you. [Person1]:  Thank you! You know they have to go to the vet on Saturday? [Person2]:  I know. What time do they go? [Person1]:  Their appointment is at eleven o'clock in the morning. [Person2]:  Okay, I won't forget.
[Person1]:  Bill, where are we going to stay tonight? [Person2]:  What about a motel? [Person1]:  What's that? [Person2]:  It's a hotel but cheaper and offers free parking. [Person1]:  Well, that sounds good, I have never lived in a motel. [Person2]:  Then let's stay in a motel. I am sure you will like it.
[Person1]:  Excuse me? Can you do me a favor, please? [Person2]:  It's my pleasure, what can I do for you? [Person1]:  I'm from England and I'm trying to make a travel plan for today. [Person2]:  What brings you here? [Person1]:  I'm a flight attendant and I'm here on vacation. [Person2]:  Where are you staying? [Person1]:  I live in the Holiday Inn Lido Hotel. [Person2]:  Oh, it's not very far. And as far as I know it is a fancy place. [Person1]:  Yes, it is. Do you know where I can get a town map? [Person2]:  We sell them, right here. [Person1]:  Great, do you have any for foreigners? I mean English version?
[Person1]:  A famous Russian ballet is coming to town next weekend. But I can't find a ticket anywhere. [Person2]:  Don't be upset. My sister just happened to have one and she can't go since she has got some sort of conflict in her schedule.
[Person1]:  Can you tell me how to reach the bank please?  [Person2]:  Which bank? There are two, the Allied Irish Bank and the Bank of Ireland.  [Person1]:  I have an AIB pass card and I want to withdraw money from the bank.  [Person2]:  You need to go to the Allied Irish Bank which is near the local shopping centre, Dunnes Stores.  [Person1]:  How do I get there. I have no knowledge of this area.  [Person2]:  Cross the road and turn left at the other side. Walk along the footpath until you reach the traffic lights. You will see a shopping centre on the right hand side. Walk across the road and turn right after the shopping centre. Keep going straight for about 100m and the bank is to your left.  [Person1]:  It sounds very complicated. How far is it from here?  [Person2]:  It's not so complicated. It's about five minutes walk from here. I can draw a map for you if you wish.  [Person1]:  Oh, I would really appreciate that . By the way will I be going North or South ?  [Person2]:  You will be going northwards. You are now in the the Western part of the city and the Allied Irish Bank is situated in the North East. Here's a rough sketch of the area. 
[Person1]:  Hello? Is that Mark?  [Person2]:  How are you? I haven't heard from you in ages.  [Person1]:  I've been overseas, So have you been busy lately?  [Person2]:  Pretty busy. So are you back for good?  [Person1]:  Yes, I was just wondering when you'd have time to go fishing.  [Person2]:  Well, I'm not working on the weekend, so we could grab some beer, ice and our fishing rods , and head out to the river.  [Person1]:  That sounds good. I've missed you my friend.  [Person2]:  Same here. 
[Person1]:  Hello, Benson Software, you're through to customer service. [Person2]:  Hello, this is Mike Williams from Smiths retailers. I'm phoning about the CD players you sent last week. Emm, I'm afraid you don't seem to have sent us enough. [Person1]:  Oh, dear, I'm sorry about that. How many did you receive? [Person2]:  Well, we received 50, but I'm pretty sure we ordered 150. [Person1]:  Just a moment, I'll check your order. Well, according to our records, you seem to have ordered 50. [Person2]:  Really? Oh, perhaps there's been a mistake. I feel certain we have ordered 150. [Person1]:  Sorry about the misunderstanding. We'll get the extra 100 to you as soon as possible.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, madame. Could I have a few minutes of your time, please? [Person2]:  Yes. [Person1]:  I'm Daniel Robinson and I represent Kruzel Automaten's limited. You see, our company has produced a robot. It seems that you live alone. You might be interested in it. [Person2]:  Can she help with my housework? [Person1]:  Sure. [Person2]:  What if I want the floor cleaned? Can she do it? [Person1]:  Certaintly, she can finish cleaning the floor within 10 minutes. She's a real wonder. [Person2]:  What about the power connection? Does she operate on batteries? [Person1]:  No, just put it under the sun once a week. [Person2]:  It really looks nice. What's the cost of this robot? [Person1]:  Only $10,000. [Person2]:  Wow! That costs an arm and a leg. I don't think I can afford it.
[Person1]:  Look, Mary! There are so many people over there! [Person2]:  Oh, I remember, there is a job fair in the personnel market. [Person1]:  I have never been to the personnel market. [Person2]:  Really? I have been there several times. [Person1]:  Are there many employers? [Person2]:  Yes. The personnel market is a place specially for job-hunters and employers. [Person1]:  So there will be many large companies in the personnel market, right? [Person2]:  Yes, there are many famous corporations. [Person1]:  When will there be a job fair? [Person2]:  Every Saturday and Sunday [Person1]:  Do I need to pay to go into the personnel market? [Person2]:  No, it's free. [Person1]:  How about going there to have a look now? [Person2]:  OK, let's go.
[Person1]:  I'm so excited, mother. Oh, a new baby! [Person2]:  My first grandchild. [Person1]:  And my first nephew. He looks a lot like you, mum. He does. [Person2]:  Do you think so? Well, I guess. He does look a lot like me. Oh, he's got Richard's eyes though. [Person1]:  Yes, he does have Richard's eyes. The baby even looks like you than Richard does. [Person2]:  Well, children usually resemble their parents. [Person1]:  It's true. Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways. And she is shy with new people just like he is. [Person2]:  You often like comparing children with their parents. [Person1]:  You're right.
[Person1]:  Which countries have you been to? [Person2]:  I'Ve been to most of the countries in Europe, several countries in asia-china, Japan, korea, and Thailand-and to the united states and Canada. [Person1]:  I thought you had been to Australia too. [Person2]:  No, but I'm planning on visiting Australia and new Zealand soon. I'Ve heard that they are beautiful countries. Which is the most beautiful country you'Ve been to? [Person1]:  I think I ' d say norway. It has many picturesque fjords, waterfalls, and mountains. [Person2]:  Isn't it really cold there? [Person1]:  Well, the north of Norway is almost always cold, but further south it can be fairly warm in summer. It's a wet country, so there's snow almost everywhere in winter. [Person2]:  I'Ve been to other Scandinavian countries, but not to Norway. Perhaps I should go and do some winter sports there.
[Person1]:  Hi, Daisy! [Person2]:  Hi Simon. Nice to meet you again [Person1]:  I hope you are Settling in at school! [Person2]:  I am! I've made lots of friends and I really enjoy my courses. [Person1]:  Good! Me too! By the way. you didn't tell me what you are studying here. [Person2]:  Didn't I? I'm doing business studies. [Person1]:  Really? That's great. You hope to join a company after graduating? [Person2]:  Maybe. My parents moved to Canada the year when I was born. We are living in Toronto. Suppose I might get a job in Toronto when I graduate. It's too soon to say really. [Person1]:  What about your friend Zoe [Person2]:  She's from Australia. She lives in Sydney. Her father runs a hotel business there and she is doing a degree in accountancy. [Person1]:  Accountancy? Really? She must be very good at figures. [Person2]:  I guess so. What about you, Simon? [Person1]:  I'm studying law. [Person2]:  Great! So I'll know who to call if I ever need a lawyer. [Person1]:  Sure, welcome anytime
[Person1]:  This is going to surprise you, but I'm happy. I think you're making the right move. [Person2]:  You do? [Person1]:  Look, maybe I shouldn't tell you this, but I'v going over to WebTracker, too. [Person2]:  No way! That's great! Then we'll still be together! [Person1]:  Actually, I'm already working for WebTracker. Vince never wanted to give me what I was worth, so I figured, what the heck. [Person2]:  No kidding! I can't believe this. You devil! [Person1]:  It's kind of cool, isn't it? I'm sort of like a secret agent.
[Person1]:  I want to ask you for a favor. I want to rent an apartment here in Beijing, but as a foreigner, I don't know the normal practice. Can you give me some advice? [Person2]:  First, why don't you tell me what you need, such as how big a room, where you want to live, whether you want to live downtown, and what you like to do. Then I can figure out which apartment is most suitable for you. [Person1]:  I am a student and want to live in Haitian, so that I can live close to my school. I like to play soccer and I like a quiet apartment so I can study. [Person2]:  I think that an apartment with two rooms and a kitchen would suit your needs. I can introduce you to a place for rent near your school. The apartment is on the 7th floor, so it is very quiet and suitable for studying. [Person1]:  That sounds great! [Person2]:  You can also go to the school's sports field to play soccer, and if you're lucky you might make some Chinese friends there. It is right near the market and has comfortable facilities. [Person1]:  Thank you so much. That's very kind of you.
[Person1]:  Well, we didn't ask for this room service maybe someone else ask it, I'm sure. [Person2]:  Oh, is it? Let me check. [Person1]:  Yes, please. [Person2]:  I'm sorry to say this room charge is yours. [Person1]:  We paid for the room service already in our room. [Person2]:  Do you have any evidences? [Person1]:  No, we got no receipt, and we pay it on the spot!
[Person1]:  Hello. Where are you heading today? [Person2]:  I'm off to Barcelona for a week. [Person1]:  Do you have your passport with you? [Person2]:  Yes, here you are. I don't need a visa to go to Spain, do I? [Person1]:  Fortunately for you, you don't. Would you like a window seat or an aisle seat? [Person2]:  Are there any seat available by the emergency exits? [Person1]:  Let me see here ...Yes, there's one left. [Person2]:  OK. I'll take that one then. [Person1]:  Alright. How many pieces of luggage are you checking in? [Person2]:  I like to travel light so I just have this one. [Person1]:  If that's your only piece of luggage, it is small enough to carry on with you. [Person2]:  That's a fantastic idea. Which gate do I need to go to? [Person1]:  You're here a bit early, so check the departure screens in the waiting area in about half an hour. Here's your boarding pass. Enjoy your flight!
[Person1]:  We'Ve been over this a thousand times. The data is irrefutable! Look, we'Ve done extensive research, built studies, and read the literature, and there is conclusive evidence to support my theory! [Person2]:  Horowitz, I beg to differ. Even in your most recent study, the investigative approach was flawed! You know as well as I do that the collection of data was not systematic, and there is a large margin of error. To draw a definitive conclusion based on that data would be misleading [Person1]:  That is preposterous! [Person2]:  You are trying to single-handedly solve one of the world's greatest mysteries, and yet you are oblivious to the fact that you are wrong! [Person1]:  I am not wrong! The chicken came first! [Person2]:  No! The egg came first!
[Person1]:  Dear audience, this evening we'll talk with a scholar who has been doing research into Mark Twain's works for 12 years. Welcome, Mr. Waton. [Person2]:  Hi, everyone! Good evening! [Person1]:  What would you like to talk about the great writer? Maybe some details that we don't quite know. [Person2]:  OK, Mark Twain, who traveled quite a lot, often because circumstances, usually financial circumstances forced him to. He was born in Florida Missouri in 1835, and moved to Hannibal, Missouri with his family when he was about four years old. Most people think he was born in Hannibal, but that isn't true. [Person1]:  Yes, I didn't know it if you don't tell us this evening. [Person2]:  Well, after his father died when he was about twelve, Twain worked in Hannibal for a while and then left so he could earn more money. He worked for a while as a typesetter on various newspapers, and then got a job as a river pilot on the Mississippi. [Person1]:  Did Twain like that job? [Person2]:  He loved this job, and many of his books show it. The river job didn't last however, because of the outbreak of the Civil War. To avoid joining the army, he went west-California. Twain worked as a gold digger without much luck. [Person1]:  That's interesting! [Person2]:  But he did succeed as a writer, once that happened, Twain traveled around the country giving lectures and earning enough money to go to Europe. Twain didn't travel much the last ten years of his life, and he didn't publish much either. Somehow his travel inspired his writings. Like many other popular writers, Twain derived much of the materials for his writing from the wealth and diversity of his own experience.
[Person1]:  What shall we do this weekend? [Person2]:  Let's go for a walk. [Person1]:  Where to go, then? [Person2]:  Let's go to the new forest. We haven't been there too long. [Person1]:  That's a good idea. I'll pick you up at about ten. Is that all right? [Person2]:  That's wonderful. See you then. Bye!
[Person1]:  Have you heard about the new Iphone? [Person2]:  Yes, I heard it's supposed to come out in June. Are you thinking about getting one? [Person1]:  I'd like to. It's not only a cell phone, but a camera, PDA and MP3 player all in one.
[Person1]:  Look what's on tomorrow, mother. That's the program you like about animals. It's before dinner. Let's watch it together. [Person2]:  OK. You want to watch the space film at 7 o'clock, don't you? [Person1]:  No, we can't. We're going to grandma's after dinner. [Person2]:  Oh, yes, that's right.
[Person1]:  Can I help you?  [Person2]:  I'd like the double cheese burger meal, please.  [Person1]:  What kind of drink would you like with that?  [Person2]:  Just coke will be fine.  [Person1]:  Would you like a super size meal? Only 2 RMB more, you'll get large coke and fries instead of medium. And today we are offering free toys all the meal boxes.  [Person2]:  That sounds good, thanks, I'd like that. Actually I'd like sprite instead of coke, thanks.  [Person1]:  That's not a problem, Miss. Will that be it?  [Person2]:  Yes, that's all.  [Person1]:  That will be 25RMB, please  [Person2]:  You got it. 
[Person1]:  Have you got some nice apples in stock today?  [Person2]:  What about these? They are very fresh and exceptionally juicy.  [Person1]:  Are they sweet?  [Person2]:  Very sweet.  [Person1]:  How much are they?  [Person2]:  These are a dollar each and those are 75 cents each.  [Person1]:  All right, I'll have a dozen of the dollar ones.  [Person2]:  OK. Anything else?  [Person1]:  Do you have any tangerines? I'd like to have two kilograms.  [Person2]:  Yes, we've just had some wonderful tangerines in from Tailand. Here they are.  [Person1]:  How much is it in all?  [Person2]:  Thirty dollars. 
[Person1]:  Hi. This is the Customer Service. How can I help you? [Person2]:  Hi. I bought one of your vacuums from spend-wart. It's broken now. [Person1]:  Is it under warranty? [Person2]:  I think so. I bought it four months ago. [Person1]:  Yes, it is still covered by our warranty. Tell me the mode number of your vacuum, please. [Person2]:  Okay. The model number is 6594 - c. [Person1]:  What's your address, your name and your phone number? [Person2]:  906 Ottawa street. My name is David Yang. My phone number is 713-786-0234. [Person1]:  Okay. There are two Customer Service Offices in your area. The nearest one is Chadwick and Hacks Appliances. [Person2]:  Could you tell me where the office is located? [Person1]:  Sure. 878 Fennel South. [Person2]:  Oh, I know that place. It's only two minutes drive. [Person1]:  You have to call the office first. [Person2]:  All right. Thank you very much for your help. [Person1]:  My pleasure.
[Person1]:  You said you like classical music very much. Then who is your favorite opera star? [Person2]:  There are three of them, the Three Tenors. [Person1]:  Oh, you mean Pavarotti, Domingo and Carreras. Have you been to their live shows? [Person2]:  Yeah, it's really a unique experience. It's a solo concert by Pavarotti. He put on the performance in the Forbidden City in Beijing. [Person1]:  I've heard of that one. It was also his swan song. [Person2]:  Besides, speaking of classical music, we should never forget about the New Year's Concert. [Person1]:  Of course not. People all over the world watch it on TV, or listen to it on the radio. [Person2]:  Sure. It's undoubtedly one of the biggest classical music events. Have you ever been to the live show? [Person1]:  Yes, I went to the New Year's Concert in 2005. [Person2]:  Wow, you are so lucky. I saw that one on TV. But it must be so different to be there in the concert hall. [Person1]:  That's for sure. You know, it's really amazing to be in the best concert hall, listening to the performance by the best orchestra. I had the greatest time ever. [Person2]:  Who was the conductor at that event? [Person1]:  Lorin Maazel. He did an amazing job. Moreover, he just celebrated his 75th birthday. [Person2]:  So cool. I wish I can go to the live New Year's Concert someday in the future. [Person1]:  The right opportunity for you would come along soon. You know, music is transnational. [Person2]:  I believe in that. Well, the performance is about to begin. Let's be quiet.
[Person1]:  How did you get around over there? Did you rent cars?  [Person2]:  No, that would be too expensive. We used the train system. We bought a special pass called a Eurail pass. It lets people use the train wherever they want, as often as they want.  [Person1]:  I've heard about Eurail passes. So those Europeans really depend on trains a lot.  [Person2]:  Yes, they do. I wish we Americans had a better train system.  [Person1]:  I know. Our train system is lousy. And besides, Americans love their cars too much.  [Person2]:  I agree. And probably the automobile companies are too powerful. They never allowed the government to develop trains.  [Person1]:  It's too bad for the environment. So much pollution from cars.  [Person2]:  Americans love cars for different reasons, I think. One reason is that we are very individualistic. And cars are a very individual way of getting around. Americans like the freedom of driving around by themselves. They don't want to ride in a train or bus with a group of people.  [Person1]:  Yes, I agree. I think it is a cultural characteristic. It would be very hard to get us Americans to change this. But you know what? Probably, in the future, Americans will have to change.  [Person2]:  Why do you say 'have to'?  [Person1]:  Because the earth's environment can't tolerate cars forever. I think cars are already causing global warming. When the problem gets more serious, world governments will have to start limiting car use.  [Person2]:  Maybe you're right. They will have to develop alternative transportation. But it will be hard in America. Too many people are used to cars. Even in our movies cars are very important.  [Person1]:  Wow! I didn't notice the time. It's almost noon. I have to get home.  [Person2]:  Do you want me to give you a ride?  [Person1]:  No, no problem. I have my car in the parking ramp around the corner.  [Person2]:  Alright. Well, I'll stay here and have another coffee. Nice running into you.  [Person1]:  See you around. 
[Person1]:  How long have you been in Taiwan?  [Person2]:  About 3 years, so I came here 2000.  [Person1]:  So, where did you grow up?  [Person2]:  Providence , Rhode Island. do you know it?  [Person1]:  I am not sure, where exactly is it?  [Person2]:  Well, not so far from New York. So what about you? Did you grow up here?  [Person1]:  No, I was born in Gaoxiong, I only moved to Taibei after I graduated. 
[Person1]:  I failed my exam. [Person2]:  What did you get? [Person1]:  B. [Person2]:  That's not bad. [Person1]:  But I should have done better. I mean, I finished the paper so quickly thinking it's a piece of cake, but when I knew my result, I was like, what? That can't be true! [Person2]:  Listen, John, I understand you are such an excellent student and I know you must have lots of stress. Forget about school and exams, then go to bed and have a good sleep. [Person1]:  I guess that's what I need.
[Person1]:  Hi, Albert. You know, John won first place during the chess competition and we've been asked to organize a party for him. [Person2]:  Yeah, sure. It's about time we started to prepare it. [Person1]:  Exactly. And when is the best time to hold it? [Person2]:  Well, John will leave for Boston next Tuesday. [Person1]:  So what about 2 days before he leaves on May thirteenth? That's a Sunday. [Person2]:  Sounds nice. [Person1]:  What about the place, at school or at a restaurant? [Person2]:  I think it'll be expensive if we hold it at a restaurant. John said his grandparents welcome us to their big house. [Person1]:  Great. And then, we ought to be thinking about invitations. Who must we invite? [Person2]:  Well, John's chess coach. [Person1]:  And John's parents? [Person2]:  Yes. Besides, we'll invite at least 5 teachers and 20 students. [Person1]:  OK. By the way, what gift will you give John? [Person2]:  A book or a pen. What about you? [Person1]:  Well, I will buy a dictionary for him. I heard him say that he needed a good one. [Person2]:  Yeah, that's a good idea.
[Person1]:  I heard that Kevin got divorced. Is that true? [Person2]:  Not so bad, but Kevin does have problems with his wife. [Person1]:  What? [Person2]:  His wife always complained that Kevin's salary was too low and got no promotion. [Person1]:  Poor Kevin, we should do something for him. He is a nice guy and does his job well. [Person2]:  Yeah, I agree with you. But you know, it's just one of those things.

[Person1]:  I am very interested in a new apartment near the Taxing Plaza, but the price is very high, I really can't afford it. [Person2]:  How much is it for each square meter? How large is the apartment? [Person1]:  It's 7500 yuan per square meter, and I really like the one with three bedrooms and a large living room. Its total area is about 80 square meters. [Person2]:  That surely will cost you a lot of money. Are you going to make a full payment? [Person1]:  Do you think I am rich enough to make it? I am thinking about buying the apartment by installments. The real estate agency says if I pay a 25 % down payment, I can move in at once. [Person2]:  If sounds so tempting. Why not go applying for a loan from the bank? They charge very low interest, so you can choose whether to pay up the balance in 10 or 20 years.
[Person1]:  Uh, hi there Diane. Nah, okay. Uh ... Hi, what's up, Di? Okay, here we go... [doorbell ringing ] [Person2]:  Uh, hi. It's David, right? [Person1]:  No, Doug. Remember? We met at Gary's party last Friday night. [Person2]:  Oh, yeah. Now I remember. You were standing all alone ... uh, oh, I ... I mean ... I mean, you ... you know. We started talking about school and stuff. [Yeah, yeah.]. Uh, how did you know I lived here? [Person1]:  Well, I just live around the corner, and I asked Gary if he knew how I could contact you, and ... [Person2]:  And? [Person1]:  Well, I was just wondering if you'd like to go out this Thursday night. [Oh.]. Well, there's this real great movie playing downtown at the theater, [Uh ...] and I thought ... Well ... well, we can't use my car 'cause I was in an accident with this wild man driving this BMW, so I've already checked the bus schedule, and ... [Person2]:  Uh-hem [Well], Well, David [No Doug! Remember?] Oh yeah. Doug. I'm sorry, but I have to work that evening. [Person1]:  Oh really? Well, I thought you said before that you quit your job. [Person2]:  Well, I did, but I found a new one. [Person1]:  Uh, well, how about this Friday night? We could have dinner and then see that movie. [Person2]:  A movie? How boring! [Person1]:  Well, well, uh, well. A movie? Yeah, for ... forget a movie. [Person2]:  Anyway, I'm afraid I have to cook dinner for my family, and ... [Person1]:  Hey, I love to cook. We could whip something up together! I mean, it would be great! [Person2]:  I don't think that's a good idea. It's just a family occasion and ... [Person1]:  Well, hey, are you free this Saturday night? I have two tickets to the football game, and I thought ... [Person2]:  Sure. I'd love to go. [Okay!] I've wanted to see a game all year. [Yeah!] My roommate will be so surprised when she finds out I have a ticket for her, and ... [Person1]:  Well, but ... [Person2]:  Oh [car screeching ... ] ... and here's my brother! He's a defensive lineman on the team. [Person1]:  Well, he doesn't look too happy. [Person2]:  Ah, he's a teddy bear, but hasn't been the same since someone ran into his BMW. [Person1]:  Oh. Let me guess. Red, right? [Person2]:  Right. [Oh] And, it's just that he's a little protective of me since I am his baby sister. [Person1]:  Hey, well, it's been really nice talking to you, but I have to run. Hey. Here are the tickets. Have a great time and, by the way, can I go out your back door?
[Person1]:  Could I order dinner? [Person2]:  Of course. What would you like? [Person1]:  I want a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare. [Person2]:  I'm so sorry. We ran out of filet mignon. May I suggest the porterhouse instead? [Person1]:  That's too bad, but the porterhouse will be okay. [Person2]:  May I be so bold as to suggest chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne? [Person1]:  Not tonight, thank you. [Person2]:  No strawberries. We'll charge your amenities account, if that's okay. [Person1]:  Charge it to whatever account you like. [Person2]:  Your meal will be delivered as soon as it's all ready. Enjoy!
[Person1]:  Here's Copellini's, my cousin's store.  [Person2]:  Sounds like an Italian name with an 'i'at the end.  [Person1]:  Admit it. You just think of Mussolini.  [Person2]:  No, I'm an art lover, so I think more of Bellini and Botticelli!  [Person1]:  Ah, yes. The Italians do love the sensual forms of the human body.  [Person2]:  Don't we all. . . hey! Your cousin sells gift items?  [Person1]:  Yeah-all from Italy. See all the saints? They're important to Roman Catholics. 
[Person1]:  Steven, have you any friend in London?  [Person2]:  Yes, my old friend Hanson lives there  [Person1]:  Are you close?  [Person2]:  Yes. He's one of my best friends. Our friendship formed at college. Why did you ask that?  [Person1]:  I'm going to London on business next week. But I know nothing about it.  [Person2]:  I get it. You want to find a guide, don't you?  [Person1]:  Yes, Steven. You always know what I want.  [Person2]:  Don't worry. I will call Hanson, and ask him to help you.  [Person1]:  Thank you! 
[Person1]:  How was the movie last night?  [Person2]:  I didn't really like it.  [Person1]:  Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography.  [Person2]:  I found it very disappointing.  [Person1]:  She liked the acting, too, because that's what she wanted to see.  [Person2]:  I wasn't happy with it.  [Person1]:  Nothing is to your satisfaction. 
[Person1]:  Jack, what is your favorite subject? [Person2]:  My favorite subject? Well, I think I prefer science. Yes, science, I find it very interesting. The science teacher makes the subject very exciting. What about you? [Person1]:  I always do very well in the maths tests. I also like geography. I like learning about people and the places where they live. Are there any subjects that you don't like Jack? [Person2]:  I don't like physics very much. It's not easy to understand, most of the children are bored with it.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, I'm looking for some English textbooks. [Person2]:  They're right over there under the dictionaries on the second shelf from the top. [Person1]:  Do you have any textbooks to help improve students reading skills? [Person2]:  Let's see. These books here focus on grammar and those are mainly for conversation practice. Here you are. This book has short passages for students to read an answer questions about. [Person1]:  Great. That is just the sort of thing that I'm looking for. Thanks a lot. [Person2]:  You're welcome. Your library card please.
[Person1]:  Lisa, did you enjoy your trip to England? [Person2]:  Yes, I did. We met some nice people there and I got to see a lot of famous places. [Person1]:  Where did you go? [Person2]:  We visited Buckingham Palace, Tower of London and the British Museum on the first day. The next day, we went to Hyde Park and London Zoo. Then we went on a boat ride on the Thames River. [Person1]:  Did you enjoy the boat ride? [Person2]:  Unfortunately, it was raining the whole time. We sat inside and had tea. Now I understand why the English like tea so much.
[Person1]:  I often sneeze after having a bad itch inside my nose. Sometimes this is accompanied by an itching throat. [Person2]:  Any other discomfort? [Person1]:  Yes. Sometimes I can notice a constriction in the chest and shortness of breath after a fit of sneezing. And I often suffer from a running nose with a profuse watery discharge. [Person2]:  Does it occur seasonally or all year round? [Person1]:  It has been seasonal during these past three years. [Person2]:  Are you sensitive to other things? [Person1]:  Yes, things like seafood and penicillin-type drugs. [Person2]:  OK. Let me examine your nose. According to your case history and the examination, I believe that it's allergic rhinitis. [Person1]:  What useful treatment can you offer? [Person2]:  I'll give you a series of specific skin tests. Then we'll know exactly what substances you're allergic to. Then I'll give you some causes of desensitization therapy.
[Person1]:  Is there anything I can do for you? [Person2]:  Excuse me, can I change my order? I am afraid I don't have so much time to enjoy my dinner. [Person1]:  I am sorry, sir. Your fish will be ready in five minutes so you can't change it. [Person2]:  That's all right.
[Person1]:  Where is John? I can't find him anywhere. [Person2]:  Haven't you heard that he is in prison? [Person1]:  What? Beg your pardon. [Person2]:  John is in prison now. He was copped outstealing. [Person1]:  I just cann't believe my ears!
[Person1]:  Do you have a copy of our service contract with Telecoms? I'm not happy with their response time and I'd like to check the terms and conditions of the contract. [Person2]:  Sure. I've got a copy here. It's due for renewal at the end of next month. We've still got time to look for another supplier if you're not happy.
[Person1]:  What do you want to eat today? [Person2]:  I feel like having some dumplings. Let's go out to eat. [Person1]:  No need! I know how to make dumplings. Let's do it from scratch. Can you give me a hand in the kitchen? I don't think I can finish everything by myself. [Person2]:  Of course. What do you want me to do? [Person1]:  Just trim vegetables for cooking. I will cut up the meat. [Person2]:  I can do that. And I would like to make dumplings later. [Person1]:  Yeah, you are my good helper, Steven. [Person2]:  Absolutely.
[Person1]:  Look at this headline - Elvis Baby Born on Spacecraft. Where do these tabloids get such crazy stories? [Person2]:  I'Ve often wondered the same thing. I also wonder who reads them. Then I realize that I'm standing here reading them myself. [Person1]:  It looks as though everyone in line reads them, or at least looks at the headlines. [Person2]:  I think we picked the right line. This one seems to be moving more quickly than the others. [Person1]:  Maybe our checker is faster at scanning the food. [Person2]:  I'm glad. We have only about twenty things here, and I'm in a hurry to get home.
[Person1]:  My stay is over. Here's the key to my room. [Person2]:  Thank you. And here's your receipt, sir. [Person1]:  Many thanks. [Person2]:  I hope your stay here was satisfactory, sir. [Person1]:  This could be a great hotel, once you get rid of the insects. The city itself is great. [Person2]:  I'm glad that the little problem didn't ruin your visit. Please have a pleasant trip home.
[Person1]:  Good morning. I'm thinking about buying some new furniture for my living room. Could you help me? [Person2]:  Certainly. As you can see, we have several three-piece suites on sale. Feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are. [Person1]:  I came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision. I think I like the black leather suite. It's on sale, isn't it? [Person2]:  Yes. The price has been reduced by 50 %. It's a real bargain. [Person1]:  I'll take it. I also need to improve the lighting in my living room. Do you have any suggestions? [Person2]:  Those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you're reading or watching tv. How big is your living room? [Person1]:  It's quite large. It's about 40 square meters. [Person2]:  I'd suggest you buy two. That allows you to change the brightness of the room better. [Person1]:  OK. I like the design of this lamps. I also need some cushion covers. I'll just browse through those ones over there.
[Person1]:  Something's wrong with my computer. [Person2]:  What's the problem? [Person1]:  My computer won't turn on. [Person2]:  Did you see if all the connections are right? [Person1]:  I'm not sure I understand what you mean. [Person2]:  The connections between your CPU and your outlet. [Person1]:  Is that what's stopping my computer from turning on? [Person2]:  If your plugs aren't connected all the way, the computer won't turn on. [Person1]:  I had no idea. [Person2]:  Why don't you try it and see what happens? [Person1]:  I'll try it right now. [Person2]:  Let me know if that doesn't work.
[Person1]:  What's the price? I hope you'll quote us favorably. [Person2]:  It's 800 US dollars per kilo CIF five percent Hamburg. [Person1]:  Frankly speaking, the price you offer is too high. We can't accept it. [Person2]:  Why? This is a fair market price. [Person1]:  It certainly is. [Person2]:  Then what leads you to think that we have to reduce our price? Please tell me candidly. [Person1]:  I look at it this way, suppliers should be able to reduce their CIF price, even lower than their home price. [Person2]:  We give you quotations on the same basis as we quote in the domestic market. [Person1]:  That's the point. Your overhead is in your domestic price, but it can't be carried in the CIF price. [Person2]:  But even with the overhead out, the export overhead must be put in. Finally, it comes to the same thing. Anyway, this is a quality item and should be sold on its value. [Person1]:  I wish you could make a reconsideration. If you don't reduce your price, we won't purchase from you any more because there's plenty of other business offering here.
[Person1]:  That was delicious. Thank you very much indeed. You're really a good cook. [Person2]:  Thank you. [Person1]:  If you like, I could do the washing-up. [Person2]:  No, don't bother. I can do it myself later. [Person1]:  All right. [Person2]:  Would you like me to make coffee now? [Person1]:  Yes. Thanks! I wonder if I went down the road to the phone box. [Person2]:  Oh. it's ten minutes' walk. If you like, I could drive you there.
[Person1]:  It's a great art show, isn't it? By the way, I'm Jim. [Person2]:  Yes, it's successful. I'm Nancy. Nice to meet you. [Person1]:  Me too. Are you from France? [Person2]:  Actually, I was born in London, and I grew up in Paris. What about you? [Person1]:  Oh, I'm a local man in New York. I'm an art teacher in New York University. This art show is held by my students. [Person2]:  Really? Great! I'm a student majoring in piano performance in the same college. I'll hold a piano party next Saturday night at the Silver Bar. Would you like to come? [Person1]:  I'd love to. Could I take my daughter with me? Besides painting, she is fond of piano as well. [Person2]:  Sure.
[Person1]:  Why are you asking me about my boyfriend?  [Person2]:  Well, Brad from school asked me out just today.  [Person1]:  Brad Bush? Good for you!  [Person2]:  But I don't know what to do.  [Person1]:  You mean you've never had a boyfriend?  [Person2]:  My mom says no boyfriend until I'm in college.  [Person1]:  Until college?  [Person2]:  Actually, that's what a lot of parents in Taiwan say to their kids. 
[Person1]:  Hello? [Person2]:  Hi Vicky. [Person1]:  Are you there yet? [Person2]:  Yes. [Person1]:  I just got off the subway. I'm almost there. Sorry I'm late. [Person2]:  That's no problem. I just wanted to tell you I'm inside. [Person1]:  Where are you? [Person2]:  On the second floor. [Person1]:  Should I come to the second floor or do you want to come to the first floor? [Person2]:  Come upstairs. [Person1]:  What? [Person2]:  Oh, Can you hear me OK? I said, come to the second floor. [Person1]:  Oh, OK. What are you doing there? [Person2]:  Just looking at some books on how to learn English. [Person1]:  Do you want to get something to eat later? [Person2]:  No, I'm still full from dinner. [Person1]:  What do you want to do? [Person2]:  I don't know for sure. When you get here we'll talk about it. [Person1]:  OK, see you soon. [Person2]:  Bye.
[Person1]:  I really need to find a parking spot.  [Person2]:  Are you looking for a space on or off campus?  [Person1]:  Do you know any spaces on campus?  [Person2]:  You can park in the student parking structure.  [Person1]:  Where is it located?  [Person2]:  You'll find the parking structure on the west side of the campus.  [Person1]:  Do you have any idea if the parking structure has any spaces left?  [Person2]:  Last time I checked, it was pretty empty.  [Person1]:  What time was it when you went up there?  [Person2]:  That was earlier this morning.  [Person1]:  It wouldn't be full right now, would it?  [Person2]:  I have no idea. 
[Person1]:  Why don't you watch where you're going?  [Person2]:  Me? You're the one who pulled out in front of me!  [Person1]:  There was plenty of room for me to pull out. You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in.  [Person2]:  Hey, listen. I had every right to stay in the lane I was in. You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out. And anyhow, you didn't give me any time to change lanes. All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me.  [Person1]:  I think my arm is broken.  [Person2]:  Sorry about your arm, but it serves you right. You need to learn how to drive. You're lucky you didn't get killed. And I'm lucky to be alive too.  [Person1]:  Listen, let's just wait until the police get here. Then we can decide whose fault this accident was.  [Person2]:  Fine with me. I know the laws of the road. I'm not worried.  [Person1]:  I have a cell phone in my car. Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side. Why don't you get it for me, and then I can call the police?  [Person2]:  Alright.  [Person1]:  It doesn't work. It looks like it's broken. I need to get to a hospital. You should drive me there.  [Person2]:  Oh, yeah? It's better if we make a police report first. Then you can go to the hospital.  [Person1]:  Damn it! I'm injured here. We could wait all day for the police.  [Person2]:  Well, you'll just have to wait. I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive. I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone. Don't worry. You'll get to the hospital in time.  [Person1]:  It really hurts.  [Person2]:  Yes, maybe it does. But if you're going to drive like you did just now, you will have to get used to a little physical pain. You know what I mean?  [Person1]:  To hell with you. The accident was your fault.  [Person2]:  I'm afraid it wasn't. And when the police get here, you will also see that it wasn't. But enough of this bickering. I'm going to go find a phone. Don't move that arm while I'm gone. Alright?  [Person1]:  To hell with you. 
[Person1]:  Mrs. Phoebe, let's talk about the delivery arrangement for our goods. [Person2]:  Sure. What's your date of delivery? [Person1]:  I informed my company and was told that the first five thousand by the end of this month. [Person2]:  What about the balance of the order? Can they also arrive at our company quickly? [Person1]:  We can deliver the balance at the price already quoted in 10 days. [Person2]:  Can you deliver them earlier? [Person1]:  I am afraid we can not do that. Would you be willing to sign an annual contract on the basis we discussed? [Person2]:  Possibly, subject to quality and delivery guarantees. [Person1]:  Of course. Well, in that case we could offer a 5 % discount for a confirmed monthly order for the next 12 months. [Person2]:  I was looking forward to something a bit more substantial. As you know, we have long-time cooperation. [Person1]:  I'm afraid that's as far as we could go. We'd already be stretching ourselves to the limit. [Person2]:  Well, let's shake on that and draw up the details of the contract.
[Person1]:  Good evening, sir. What's your pleasure? [Person2]:  Give me a shot of whisky and soda. [Person1]:  With or without ice, sir? [Person2]:  Certainly without ice. Ice will spoil the taste. [Person1]:  Would you like to say 'when', please, sir. ( Pouring soda ) [Person2]:  Whoa, when. [Person1]:  Enjoy your drink, sir.
[Person1]:  Did you grab everything from the car? We should check before we leave this area. We have a long day of hiking ahead of us. [Person2]:  Yes, I did it already. Where should we go now? [Person1]:  We're going up to the top part of the mountain. [Person2]:  Is that where we get the tickets? [Person1]:  Yeah, it's about a 20-minute walk from here. [Person2]:  That's not so bad. [Person1]:  Just wait till we get the tickets. It's a 3-hour hike from there to the top. [Person2]:  How far is the lake from the top? [Person1]:  Another 40 minutes, we can have lunch at the top or down by the water. [Person2]:  We had a late breakfast, so I can wait. I'm excited to see this lake. The guidebook says it changes color throughout the year. [Person1]:  That's true, in the fall and winter, it's skyblue because of the light reflecting off tiny pieces of ice in the lake. At this time of year. It turns green because of the plants that grow under the water. [Person2]:  That's so cool, it's a good thing I brought my camera.
[Person1]:  Good evening. Do you have any rooms available at the moment? [Person2]:  Yes, we do. How many nights do you want to stay? [Person1]:  4. If it's possible. [Person2]:  OK, let me see. I'm sorry, sir. I'm afraid we can only give you a room for 2 nights. It's a very busy period right now. We're almost fully booked these days. [Person1]:  Alright. I'll just stay for tonight then. It's too late to go to other hotels now. I'll search for another one tomorrow. [Person2]:  That's an excellent idea, sir. And thank you for your understanding. So a single room for one night. Here is your key card and your room is on the seventh floor. [Person1]:  Thanks. By the way, is there a swimming pool in the hotel? [Person2]:  Yes, there is. It's on the fifteenth floor, but it closes at 10 [Person1]:  That's too bad. [Person2]:  We do have a gym that opens 24 hours. It's on the fourteenth floor. [Person1]:  Great, thanks for letting me know. [Person2]:  You're welcome, sir. Oh, before I forget, breakfast deserved on the second floor from 6
[Person1]:  I need my minibar restocked. [Person2]:  Everything is gone, sir? [Person1]:  There's not a drop left of anything. [Person2]:  Is there anything in particular you want? [Person1]:  Yes, the Perrier and the Jim Beam hit the spot. Let me have three more of each. [Person2]:  Got it. Anything else? [Person1]:  I really liked the apples. Bring me a couple of apples, please. [Person2]:  Not a problem. Anything else? [Person1]:  Oh, yes, one more thing [Person2]:  Someone will be up shortly with your order, sir.
[Person1]:  Hello, hot water overflowed from the bathtub. Would you help me? [Person2]:  Would you turn off the tap? [Person1]:  I did it. [Person2]:  Then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door. [Person1]:  Ok, I will. [Person2]:  I will have our housekeeper come right away. [Person1]:  I am sorry, I was too tired to fall asleep. [Person2]:  When you woke up, the water was coming out the tub? [Person1]:  Right. Can I compensate for the damage with the travel accident insurance?
[Person1]:  I hear you are expecting your family. [Person2]:  Yes, my parents, and soon my brother as well. [Person1]:  I didn't know you had a brother. [Person2]:  Oh, yes, he is two years older than me. He lives in New Zealand so I don't see him that often. [Person1]:  Oh, nice. Is he coming on his own or with the family? [Person2]:  His son is coming as well. He wants to go to university here in England so they will visit a few universities while they are here. [Person1]:  Does your brother have just one son? [Person2]:  No, he has two daughters as well. His wife and daughters are visiting her parents. So I won't see them. [Person1]:  I'm sure your parents are looking forward to seeing their grandson. [Person2]:  Oh yes, they are really looking forward to it. They went to New Zealand last year and loved it. [Person1]:  So when are they all coming? [Person2]:  My parents are already here. My brother and nephew are arriving on Monday.
[Person1]:  God, I didn't realize. I didn't, I didn't know. . . [Person2]:  . . . Who you were with? I didn't know whom you were with. [Person1]:  Excuse me? [Person2]:  Sorry, it's from the Godfather. It's when the, when the movie producer realizes Tom Higgins had emissary of Vito Corleone, it's just before the horse's head ends up in the bed with all the bloody sheets, you know, wakes up, and AAAL! Never mind. [Person1]:  You were spying on me, weren't you? You probably rented those children. [Person2]:  Why would I spy on you? [Person1]:  Because I am your competition which you know perfectly well, or you would not put up that sign just around the corner. [Person2]:  The entrance to our store is around the corner. And there's no other way of saying that. It's not the name of our store. It's where it is. And you do not own the phrase around the corner. [Person1]:  What is that? What are you doing? You're taking all the caviar! That caviar is a garnish? [Person2]:  Look, the reason I came into your store is because I was spending the day with Annabell and matt. And I was buying them presents. I'm the type of guy who likes to buy his way into the hearts of children who are his relative. And there's only one place to find a children's book in the neighborhood. That will not always be the case. And it was yours. And it is a charming little bookstore. You probably sell what 350, 000 worth of books in a year.
[Person1]:  Melissa? I'd like to invite you to my wife's birthday party. [Person2]:  Thanks, Frank. I'd love to come. When is it? [Person1]:  Her birthday is on the 9th. We're going to have dinner at a Mexican restaurant, and then maybe go out dancing. [Person2]:  Sounds like fun. You can count me in! Just give me directions to the restaurant.
[Person1]:  Hi, Mrs. Henderson. [Person2]:  Hi, Steven. Do you have time and chat with me? [Person1]:  Of course I have plenty of time. What's new? [Person2]:  The new couple next door divorced. Have you heard about it? [Person1]:  No. The Hills? Who filed for divorce first? [Person2]:  I guess it Is Mrs. Hill. She sued for divorce on the grounds of her husband's misconduct with his secretary. [Person1]:  Oh, maybe not. It's just your guess. Do not give currency to idle gossip. [Person2]:  OK. I close my mouth.
[Person1]:  Does she make any sense to you? [Person2]:  No. It's all Greek to me. [Person1]:  She's speaking French, not Greek. [Person2]:  I know that. I mean I couldn't understand her at all. [Person1]:  Me neither. All I have to do is study French hard. [Person2]:  I wish you the best of luck.
[Person1]:  How do you usually spend your time, now that you'Ve retired? [Person2]:  Well, I nearly always get up at dawn. I don't like sleeping in late. The days are longer in summer than in winter, so I get up in summer. I usually do some exercise when I get up. [Person1]:  What do you have for breakfast? [Person2]:  I usually have cereal, but sometimes I cook a traditional English breakfast. [Person1]:  that sounds nice. How do you spend your mornings? [Person2]:  I usually do housework in mornings. I go shopping occasionally. I like to do all my shopping in one bag trip to the supermarket. I always drive to the big supermarket in the city center. It takes about 20 minutes to drive there. [Person1]:  How do you spend your afternoons? [Person2]:  I usually meet some friends and we play sports together or I might spend some time alone on my hobbies. I spend winter evening watching tv, but I spend summer evening at cultural events if I have time.
[Person1]:  We came too early. There're still three hours before the performance starts. [Person2]:  I know. Sorry, I shouldn't have rushed you, but I just couldn't stay at home and wait. [Person1]:  Never mind. What about taking a look around the theater? [Person2]:  Why not? I'd love to do that. [Person1]:  Here we go. There is a museum of the Beijing Opera art. ( They come to the museum of the Beijing Opera art. ) [Person2]:  Wow. Look at this. So delicate and beautiful. Did ancient Chinese people really wear them? [Person1]:  Not really. They are just opera costumes. Do you like the embroidery? [Person2]:  I surely do. They must have had advanced machines in ancient China to do that. [Person1]:  No, no, no. They are all handmade, girl. You know, the ancient Chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework. [Person2]:  Unbelievable! I could never do that. [Person1]:  Very few can. That's why these clothes only appear in the museum. [Person2]:  Listen! Some people are singing outside. Is it the opera? [Person1]:  Oh, yes. I heard there was an opera fans club. They are probably practicing now. Wanna have a look? [Person2]:  Yes, let's do it. [Person1]:  Follow me. Make sure not to interrupt them. [Person2]:  Of course not. We don't do that.
[Person1]:  Oh! [Person2]:  What fools we were! [Person1]:  To think of it! All my old silver! It meant so much to me. [Person2]:  And my new car. To think that he simply drove off with everything in my car. That's what hurts me most. [Person1]:  What's so terrible too, is the fools we've made of ourselves. [Person2]:  I hardly dare call the police. They'll just laugh at us. [Person1]:  I'll never get over it. Oh, Harry, it was all so unnecessary. That man!! How could he do this to us after we'd put him up? [Person2]:  And his story didn't even hold together. I feel such an idiot.
[Person1]:  May I help you? [Person2]:  Yes, I'm looking for a job as a clerk typist in English. [Person1]:  I'm Mary Kelly. May I ask your name? [Person2]:  My name is B. How are you, Miss Kelly? [Person1]:  I'm glad to meet you, Mr. Zhuang. Sit down, please. [Person2]:  Thank you, Miss Kelly. [Person1]:  What are your qualifications for being a clerk typist? [Person2]:  I can type 120 words a minute and I take shorthand at 80 words a minute. [Person1]:  Would you be willing to take a typing and shorthand test? [Person2]:  Yes, I would. [Person1]:  ( After testing ) Your typing and stenography are pretty good. Would you be interested in applying for the job? [Person2]:  Yes, I'd like to give it a try. [Person1]:  All right. You need to have an interview with our manager, Mr. McBride. Let's go to his office.
[Person1]:  OK darling, I got some pizzas, potato chips, hot dogs and lots of cheese! [Person2]:  Oh John, I thought we said we would start eating right! Remember? Our new healthy lifestyle? That's all junk food! [Person1]:  Humph! Right, so what did you get? [Person2]:  Well, healthy food, of course! I got some whole wheat bread, skimmed milk, fresh fish and organic carrots. . . [Person1]:  Organic? What's organic? Do we need organic carrots. . . ? [Person2]:  They were grown without using any chemicals that are harmful to our health. And yes, John, we need organic carrots. . . [Person1]:  Oh, so organic vegetables are the ' green'option, right? [Person2]:  Yup, better for the environment and better for us! [Person1]:  Wait a minute, what's that? . . . Doughnuts? They organic doughnuts, Kelly? [Person2]:  I like doughnuts.
[Person1]:  How are Zina's new programmers working out?  [Person2]:  I hate to admit it, but they're good. And fast. The Filipino kid is a genius.  [Person1]:  So you'll make the Stars. com deadline, and have us up and running next week?  [Person2]:  It'll be close, but we'll make it.  [Person1]:  Good. After Stars. com starts paying us, we won't need Vikam's cash anymore.  [Person2]:  And if we don't need them, we won't need Zina, either. 
[Person1]:  Mr. Parker. When did you arrive home yesterday evening? [Person2]:  At about 8 [Person1]:  What did you do right after you entered your flat? [Person2]:  Well, I washed my hands and then watched the Sports News. [Person1]:  When did you have supper? [Person2]:  At about 8 [Person1]:  Did you stay at home all evening? [Person2]:  Yes. [Person1]:  But your friend said, that he phoned you several times between 8 [Person2]:  Well, I think I was in the bath at that time. [Person1]:  No, you weren't, you were not even at home last night, you robbed a bank in James Street.
[Person1]:  Hello. Is everything OK, there? [Person2]:  I'm having a little trouble with this form. [Person1]:  What seems to be the problem? [Person2]:  There are two types of L / C here and I'm not sure which one I want. [Person1]:  That's right, there's'revocable'and'irrevocable'. We usually go for the irrevocable one, it's the most popular. [Person2]:  So, I should choose that one? [Person1]:  I would recommend it, yes. Then you just need to complete that form. [Person2]:  I see. It's very nice of you to help me. Is this form alright? [Person1]:  Yes, that's all in order. Let's get this processed for you, then.
[Person1]:  What do you think are the most important things to do when running a business? [Person2]:  Well, there are several things. Of course, you must do everything you can to keep costs down and revenues high. [Person1]:  So, do you think workers should be paid as little as possible? [Person2]:  No. if you do that, the workers won't like their jobs. They will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover. Those things will increase you costs. [Person1]:  How can a business maximise revenues? [Person2]:  You need to invest in some good advertising. You have to know where your potential customers are and target them. It's no good trying to sell computer games to older people. The market is too small. [Person1]:  What else do you suggest? [Person2]:  Find out what other companies charge for the same products or services. Price yourself near the low end. Don't be much cheaper than everyone else, because many customers distrust very cheap things. They think that is must be poor quality if it's that cheap.
[Person1]:  Your office called and said that the owners had made a counter-offer to my offer to purchase their house. [Person2]:  To your offer of three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, the owners have counter-offered three hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars. [Person1]:  I think that maybe I should accept their offer. [Person2]:  You, of course, have two ways of responding. You can say yes or come up with another offer. [Person1]:  I want to make another offer, but I am afraid that they will decline and I will lose this house. [Person2]:  There is always a chance that someone could outbid you, but you could try one more offer if you like. [Person1]:  I would now like to offer three hundred and thirty thousand dollars as a counter-offer. [Person2]:  After the owners get home from work tonight, I will approach them with your offer. [Person1]:  Can you tell me how long it will take them to get back to me? [Person2]:  I don't think that it will take as long as the response to the first offer.
[Person1]:  Can you show me some jade, please? [Person2]:  Yes, of course. Do you like a jade necklace? [Person1]:  No, but I do like jade bracelets. [Person2]:  Here are all kinds of jades. Choose whatever you like, please. [Person1]:  Thank you. ( A moment later ) Oh, this one is quite impressive. I'll take it. By the way, do you sell pearl earrings? [Person2]:  Yes. Natural pearls or cultured pearls? We have both kinds. [Person1]:  I wonder which looks more lustrous. [Person2]:  Well, natural pearls are of higher value, but the cultured pearls have equal lustre and are just as beautiful. [Person1]:  Oh, I see. I think I prefer a natural one.
[Person1]:  Do you have anything in particular that you would like our firm to take into account? [Person2]:  Yes, my house is far away from here. May I ask for an apartment? [Person1]:  No problem. We will offer you a room with one bedroom and a kitchen. . [Person2]:  That's great. Thank you so much.
[Person1]:  Have you had any publications? [Person2]:  Yes. I have published some articles in China Daily and Economist. [Person1]:  How about your communication skills? [Person2]:  As a journalist, I have strong communication skills. I am good at both discourse management and strategic competence.
[Person1]:  How was your education going on in Australia? [Person2]:  I'm going to graduate this summer. [Person1]:  Where are you going to work then, in Australia or back in China? [Person2]:  I'm planning to return to China after graduation. [Person1]:  Why are you choosing to leave a foreign country? Many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad. [Person2]:  Well, I think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment. [Person1]:  Yeah, China's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country.
[Person1]:  Hey. Have you been watching any of the World Cup soccer matches? [Person2]:  Well, I was watching until my favorite team was bounced out of the first round of play. I mean, they should have made all the way to the second round, but a whole series of events cost the team the opportunity to prove themselves on the world stage. [Person1]:  What do you mean? [Person2]:  Well, in the first match, two of their star players were out with nagging injuries, so the rest of the players, unfortunately, just couldn't keep up with the opposing team. [Person1]:  Well, that just life. I mean every team is going to have players out with injuries. [Person2]:  Yea, but that's beside the point. And, and then, in the second game, the refs made some terrible calls, allowing the opposing team to slip by with a victory. I mean, we were robbed on that one. The refs must have been walking in their sleep! [Person1]:  But, didn't one of your own players accidentally kick the ball twice into his own goal? I mean that doesn't sound like a bad call to me. [Person2]:  That's just beside the POINT! [Person1]:  Really? [Person2]:  And finally, our team was ahead in the final watch---I mean they were way out ahead until the other team rallied in the final three minutes of play to squeak out a victory. It was a total embarrassment for our team. Our team was booed. All I can say is that the sun must have been in our players' eyes ... [Person1]:  Uh, wasn't it a night game? [Person2]:  That's beside the point, too. You just not understanding anything I'm saying. [Person1]:  So, who are you rooting for now, seeing that your team has been eliminated? [Person2]:  Ah, I can't watch any more soccer, so I've been following an online chess tournament. [Person1]:  What?! Now, that has to be the most ridiculous reaction I have ever heard of. So, you're going to completely boycott the rest of the play just because your team got bounced out of the tournament? [Person2]:  Ah, forget it. You just don't understand.
[Person1]:  Christmas is coming up. Han Meimei, let me ask you a question. [Person2]:  Go ahead. [Person1]:  Do you celebrate Christmas? [Person2]:  No, we have Chinese New Year's celebrations. [Person1]:  But Christmas is the biggest holiday of the year. People are busy shopping and preparing presents for relatives and friends before Christmas Eve. [Person2]:  That sounds exciting. [Person1]:  Children hang their stockings over the fireplace so that Father Christmas can fill them with sweets and toys. [Person2]:  What if they don't have a fireplace? [Person1]:  No problem. They always find some place to hang them. By the way, what are you going to do at Christmas? [Person2]:  My teacher, Professor Smith and his wife have invited me to a Christmas dinner. [Person1]:  Sounds great.
[Person1]:  Look at them! They've the latest Adidas shoes. [Person2]:  You've already had a pair of shoes. [Person1]:  They cost only $100. [Person2]:  $1007 For a pair of shoes? [Person1]:  But they are the latest. I just want to get them. There is a match next week. Oh, Mum, please! [Person2]:  Ok, this is the last time.
[Person1]:  Welcome to Bill's Fabric World. What can I do for you today?  [Person2]:  I was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes?  [Person1]:  Sure we do! We have the best tailors in the country! What is it that you need exactly?  [Person2]:  Well, I'm looking to get a custom-made suit.  [Person1]:  Excellent! We have the finest cashmeres at affordable prices. How about we get you measured? Let's start off by measuring the width of your shoulders. Now, let's measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here.  [Person2]:  Can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar? My neck gets easily irritated.  [Person1]:  No problem! Now for your pants, let me just measure your waist and the inseam.  [Person2]:  You might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area. I tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays.  [Person1]:  OK. Now you can pick your fabric and pattern design. Please follow me. 
[Person1]:  Can I have breakfast in my room? [Person2]:  Certainly, madam. Breakfast is served in your room from 7 o'clock until 9. Here's the menu. [Person1]:  I'd like to have Chinese food. [Person2]:  Yes, madam. And at what time would you like it? [Person1]:  About eight o'clock, I think. [Person2]:  Very good, madam. And what kind of fruit juice would you like? [Person1]:  I'd like orange, please. [Person2]:  Orange juice. And would you prefer tea or milk? [Person1]:  Tea, please. [Person2]:  Thank you very much. Good night.
[Person1]:  Could you tell me what university you want to go to, John?  [Person2]:  Pardon?  [Person1]:  What university would you enter?  [Person2]:  University? Why? You asked me last year.  [Person1]:  Oh, I forget. Sorry.  [Person2]:  I went to Harvard University.  [Person1]:  Did you? And what course did you take there?  [Person2]:  God save me! Is there anything wrong with you? Didn't I tell you?  [Person1]:  I've not known. Perhaps, I've got a bad memory.  [Person2]:  I did a B. A. in economics. Remember?  [Person1]:  Terrific! B. A. , again and again-B. A. 
[Person1]:  Hi, Mark, how are you? [Person2]:  Actually I'm really fed up. It's about Jane. I want to be friends with her, but I just don't know how to make her notice me or...  [Person1]:  Wait a minute. Look, Jane is in your chemistry class, isn't she? You are good at chemistry. You could offer to help with her chemistry homework. How about that? [Person2]:  But she is better than me at chemistry. [Person1]:  OK, well, there's a party at David's house on Friday night. You could invite her to go with you. [Person2]:  Oh, I don't think I'll need to. David is her cousin.
[Person1]:  Good morning, I'd like to buy a cake. [Person2]:  No problem sir, we have many cakes here, what size would you like? [Person1]:  Well, it's for my coworker's birthday, there are 14 people in the office. [Person2]:  Well, this cake feeds 12 people and this one behind it feeds 20. [Person1]:  I'll take the bigger one, it's better to have too much than not enough. [Person2]:  Sounds good, do you want it delivered? [Person1]:  Yes. Can you deliver it to my office? The birthday party will be after work at a park near the office.
[Person1]:  Reception can I help you? [Person2]:  Yes, please, this is Mrs. Browning, calling from room 203. [Person1]:  Yes, madam, what can I do for you? [Person2]:  I'm not sure about the check out time. I mean, how soon do I have to leave my room? [Person1]:  Normally, it's by 12 [Person2]:  Oh dear! [Person1]:  Is there a problem, madam? [Person2]:  Well, you see, my plane takes off at 5 [Person1]:  I see, you may keep your room until 2 [Person2]:  Oh, you are so kind. Thank you very much. [Person1]:  My pleasure.
[Person1]:  Dad, dad. [Person2]:  Uh, what? [Person1]:  The movie is over. You slept through the best part. [Person2]:  Ah, I must have fallen asleep during the last few minutes. [Person1]:  You did. He were out for so long. You should've brought your pillow and blanket. So what did you think about it? [Person2]:  Well, overall, I'm a little disappointed with the movie. The story was not believable. You have to admit. [Person1]:  Ah, I thought it was fantastic. I mean, you have to admit that the special effects were awesome. And the acting wasn't bad, either. [Person2]:  What about the airship officer? He was strange. He was always talking to himself. [Person1]:  Well, he was a little unusual, but the airship's doctor was amazing. It was so cool when he brought the captain back to life after landing on Venus. [Person2]:  That was pretty realistic. But then the rest of the movie just went from bad to worse. [Person1]:  How do you know? You were sleeping so soundly. [Person2]:  Well, turn off the TV. Let's go to bed or you will be late for tomorrow's classes.
[Person1]:  Hi, I have a reservation under the name Sally. [Person2]:  Hi, Sally, a room for 12 people at 7 [Person1]:  Yes, we've got two more people coming, though. Is that OK? [Person2]:  No problem. Your room can easily fit as many as 16 people. [Person1]:  Perfect. Thanks. Can I have a look at the menu while I wait for my friends? [Person2]:  Of course. May I ask when your friends will be arriving? [Person1]:  I'm sure most of them will arrive on time. I got here early because I wanted to arrange the food in advance. [Person2]:  I see. Here is the menu. [Person1]:  Thank you very much.
[Person1]:  Good afternoon, Sir. You're here to see about a Temporary Loan, right? The loans we offer are for purchasing income-generating assets. Is that what you require? [Person2]:  Yes, that's exactly what I need. How about terms for these? [Person1]:  Well, we offer 60 - day or 90 - day loans. The balance of the loan is to be repaid in full by the end of the specified period. [Person2]:  Is there any flexibility on that? [Person1]:  Unfortunately, not. [Person2]:  OK. In my position, I think the best way to go would be for the 90 - day loan. That would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan. [Person1]:  Not a problem, Sir. If you'd just fill out these forms, and of course with necessary clearance, we can get you the money right away.
[Person1]:  Mike, shall we book two tickets online? [Person2]:  Fine. Shanghai and Beijing are thousands of miles away. How about bullet train? Faster and relatively cheap, I think. [Person1]:  Yeah. How many tickets remain? [Person2]:  Oh, what a shame. Only sleeping cars have tickets. Others are all out of stock. The price of the sleeping car is almost the same as the airplane. You see, the discount plane tickets are no more than 500 yuan. A good deal, isn't it? [Person1]:  Brilliant idea! That will make our journey rewarding and much safer.
[Person1]:  Finally we're on board! [Person2]:  Yes. It was so crowded. I'm worn-out. Let's find our seats. [Person1]:  Are they window seats or aisle seats? [Person2]:  Let me see. . . yes, one window seat and one aisle. [Person1]:  Ok. But can I trade my seat with you? I prefer the one near the window. I'm a terrible flyer. I always get airsick and can never relax until after I've landed. [Person2]:  That's fine. I'd like to be on the aisle anyway. It's easier to get in and out. [Person1]:  Thanks. Where shall we put our luggage? [Person2]:  I think the smaller carry-on bag can go in the overhead compartment, and the others can go under the seat. [Person1]:  Good idea. [Person2]:  Don't forget to keep the seat belt on. [Person1]:  Ok. Hope it's a pleasant trip. [Person2]:  Yes! [Person1]:  And no hijackers. [Person2]:  Oh, you have too wild of an imagination.
[Person1]:  Tell me something about yourself and your past experience. [Person2]:  I have eight years of experience working in the IT industry. For the past two years, I have been working as a project manager for a dotcom. I am also MI certified. I'm looking for a team environment where I can join the excitement of building a company. [Person1]:  What experience have you had that qualifies you for this position? [Person2]:  I have worked on a variety of projects and jobs in the high tech industry. I wanted to have the experience of working for a dotcom and have learned something about being in on the ground floor of a business. [Person1]:  What attracted you to this job? [Person2]:  I've been searching for a while now to find a company that had a business model and corporate philosophy like yours. I am interested in working for a company that provides products and services to the K - 12 education market. My background is in this field, and my strength is in building relationships and solving problems. I am excited and interested in the idea of developing business relationships through e-commerce. [Person1]:  What qualities do you think are important to this position? [Person2]:  To have a combination of technical and business knowledge and to be very results-oriented. My past record shows that I have those qualities and more. Because of my business acumen and technical know-how, the teams I have managed accomplished outstanding results, including booking more than $ 50 million in online revenue. [Person1]:  When have you been most motivated? [Person2]:  When I have a specific project to complete, I like to know the specifics of a project from beginning to end. I like definite deadlines and I like to meet those deadlines. I expect some deviation from the original plan, but I try to stay focused and not let myself drift too far. I have great attention to detail and like to take my time and do it right the first time. [Person1]:  Why did you leave your last position? [Person2]:  I've set some goals for myself and my career, and unfortunately I'm at a standstill in my current situation. I have begun to explore options available before I spend too much time in a job where I can't advance. My goal is to continue to take on new responsibilities and be a key contributor to the success of an online venture. [Person1]:  What are your salary expectations? [Person2]:  I really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary. I'd like to postpone that discussion until later. [Person1]:  Do you have any questions? [Person2]:  Yes, I do. Who are your financial backers? Who are the key competitors? Does the company have a plan for the IPO? What would you say is the best thing about your product or service?
[Person1]:  . . . The rings please. May this ring be blessed so he who gives it and she who wears it may abide in peace, and continue in love until life's end. [Person2]:  With this ring I thee wed. Wear it as a symbol of our love and commitment. [Person1]:  Honey, that's my pinkie. The ring goes on the ring finger! [Person2]:  This one? [Person1]:  That's my index finger! [Person2]:  Oh, right. This one, right? [Person1]:  Umm. . . that's the thumb, Nick. [Person2]:  Okay, Okay, I got it! This is the ring finger! [Person1]:  That's my middle finger, Nick. This is my ring finger!
[Person1]:  Ok. . . I'll talk to you later. Bye [Person2]:  Carrie, are you ok? You seem a bit down. [Person1]:  I just got off the phone with my boyfriend. He is always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing. It's so hard to talk to him at times. [Person2]:  Maybe it's just that he is stressed out from work or something. He does have a pretty nerve wracking job you know. [Person1]:  Yeah but, he is always in a really foul mood. I try to find out what's bothering him or get him to talk about his day but, he always shuts down and brushes me off. [Person2]:  Men are like that you know. They can feel nervous, anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness. [Person1]:  I guess you are right. What do you think I should do? He wasn't always this grouchy you know. . . [Person2]:  Talk to him, try to cheer him up when he is down and if that doesn't work, I say get rid of him and get a new one! [Person1]:  You are something else you know that?
[Person1]:  have you adapted to the lifestyle in China? [Person2]:  yeah, almost. But there is one thing. [Person1]:  what? [Person2]:  I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people. I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China, but. . . [Person1]:  what is it? [Person2]:  some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others. [Person1]:  that makes you feel uncomfortable? [Person2]:  yeah. we never do that in a public office. [Person1]:  perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy. [Person2]:  i have felt that. One day when i was in a queue, reading a newspaper story, the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding. [Person1]:  well, that's not rare. I've seen people reading at others'newspaper while taking a metro or a bus. [Person2]:  just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him? [Person1]:  yeah. [Person2]:  Oh, I'm shocked.
[Person1]:  And so, that concludes my outline for our marketing strategy next year. Thank you very much for your time. [Person2]:  Hey, that was quite the presentation! Honestly, I was completely blown away by your strategy outline. I've gotta say, Alex, you really wowed me today. [Person1]:  Aw, come on ; it was nothing. I'm just doing my job. [Person2]:  No, I think you deserve some recognition here ; I mean, if I look back on your previous presentations, this is a huge improvement. [Person1]:  Well, Kristin did give me a hand with the slides. She's a real wiz on PowerPoint. [Person2]:  And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies. I really appreciate you taking the time to think though my suggestions. [Person1]:  Yeah, well, that was some good advice. You made some really good points. [Person2]:  Well, I just wanted to say well done. Really you did a great job.
[Person1]:  Can we make you an offer? We would like to run the campaign for four extra weeks. [Person2]:  Well, can we summarize the problem from my point of view? First of all, the campaign was late. It missed two important trade affairs. The ads also did not appear into key magazines. As a result, the campaign failed. Do you accept that summary of what happened? [Person1]:  Well, the delay wasn't entirely our fault. You did in fact make late changes to the specifications of the advertisements. [Person2]:  Uh, actually, you were late with the initial proposals so you have very little time and in fact, we only asked for small changes. [Person1]:  Well whatever, can we repeat our offer to run the campaign for 4 extra weeks? [Person2]:  That's not really the point. The campaign missed two key trade affairs. Because of this, we are asking you either to repeat the campaign next year for free, or we only pay 50% of the fee for this year. [Person1]:  Could we suggest a 20% reduction to the fee together with the four week sustention to the campaign. [Person2]:  We are not happy. We lost business. [Person1]:  I think we both made mistakes. The responsibility is on both sides. [Person2]:  Ok, let's suggest a new solution. How about a 40% cut in fee, or a free repeat campaign? [Person1]:  Well, let's take a break, we're not getting very far. Perhaps we should think about this.
[Person1]:  Hi, Jone, how are you? [Person2]:  Terrible. [Person1]:  What's wrong? [Person2]:  Someone robbed my apartment last week. The robber took $ 550. [Person1]:  Oh, no! Did you call the police? [Person2]:  No. [Person1]:  Why not? [Person2]:  My English isn't very good. I didn't know what to say to them. [Person1]:  I'm going to give you some advice, Jone. If this happens again, you should call the police immediately. You should try to remember everything. You should explain everything to the police.
[Person1]:  I'd like to talk to you for a second, please. [Person2]:  Okay, Mark, What's up? [Person1]:  I'd like to know why you're always taking credit for work we'Ve done together like that line in the new Ice Cream ad? [Person2]:  That was my line, Mark. I know we worked on the ad together, but that was definitely my line.
[Person1]:  How's it going? [Person2]:  I'm fine. Thanks for asking. [Person1]:  What did you need? [Person2]:  I would like to make a withdrawal. [Person1]:  How much money would you like to withdraw? [Person2]:  I want to take out $ 300. [Person1]:  Which account are you making this withdrawal from? [Person2]:  I want it taken from my checking account. [Person1]:  All right, here is your $ 300. [Person2]:  Thanks a lot. [Person1]:  Is there anything else that I can do for you today? [Person2]:  No. That's everything. Thank you.
[Person1]:  Excuse me. Would you please make a suit with this material?  [Person2]:  Sure. May I take your measurements?  [Person1]:  Please don't make it too tight. This is for autumn wear, so make sure you allow for a cardigan underneath.  [Person2]:  I see, sir. Can you come back for a fitting on the 10th, that's in a week's time?  [Person1]:  The 10th? I'm sorry, but you see I'm going to attend an international conference on the 11th. Could you have the suit ready by the 8th, or at the latest, the 9th?  [Person2]:  Well, a business suit usually takes ten days' time. But in your case, we'll try to have it ready sooner. How about coming for your fitting on the 8th? Then your suit will be ready for you on the 10th?  [Person1]:  That's fine, thank you. 
[Person1]:  Hello, IBA Bank, how can I help you? [Person2]:  Hello, I'd like to talk to someone about making a withdrawal. [Person1]:  You can withdraw money from your account either over the counter or via the ATM. [Person2]:  Yes, but the problem is that I have a Savings Account with you, and I need to take some money from that. Do I really have to give 90 days notice if I want my money? [Person1]:  Actually, you only need to give 7 days notice if you wish to withdraw funds. Of course, you will lose some interest due to the withdrawal. [Person2]:  That's not a problem. I'll pop in later today to make a formal request. Thanks!
[Person1]:  Let's sit here and order some coffee while I'll show you some pictures. [Person2]:  Good idea. But I'd prefer tea, please. [Person1]:  This is Ted, my roommate. We live in the dormitory. [Person2]:  Is this your room? You certainly have a lot of books. How did you ever manage to put them in such a good order? [Person1]:  Ted did this for me. He is a neat person. [Person2]:  Do you like living in the dormitory? [Person1]:  Yes. Ted is a very good guy. Sometimes I leave my books and clothes lying around and he gets angry. Sometimes he turns his radio up too loud and makes much noise, then I get angry. But on the whole we can get well along. [Person2]:  Where did you take this picture? [Person1]:  That's a picture of us taken when we went to the beach during vacation~ [Person2]:  You look so smart. This is a lovely puppy. [Person1]:  That's my dog Allen. He is now with my parents.
[Person1]:  Morning. Gall. Did you enjoy your holiday in the country? [Person2]:  Yes. We had a great time. And some friends went along with us. [Person1]:  Where did you stay? In a hotel? [Person2]:  No. We camped in the mountains, near Snowdon. We cooked all our meals over an open fire. [Person1]:  Sounds great. Was the weather good? [Person2]:  The sun shone nearly every day and it didn't rain at all. [Person1]:  Did you like the people there? [Person2]:  Yes, they were friendly. We met some farmers and had tea in their houses.
[Person1]:  Wow, the view from the peak is so grand!  [Person2]:  Look, most of the maple leaves have turned red.  [Person1]:  Did you ever see this kind of beautiful scene?  [Person2]:  Of course, my father used to take me to Xiang Shan or somewhere like that as a child.  [Person1]:  But my father did not. He didn't have much time.  [Person2]:  Honey, I'm sorry. I promise you, this summer vacation, I will take you to Huang-Shan Mountains. It is more beautiful and magnificent.  [Person1]:  Really? It's a deal. Have you ever been there?  [Person2]:  Yes, I went there five years ago. You were still a baby at that time.  [Person1]:  It really gets me interested. Is it higher than Xiang Shan?  [Person2]:  Surely. You can enjoy the beauty of numerous streams and waterfalls. The sea of clouds has a fairy tale beauty.  [Person1]:  Can I see the rainbow?  [Person2]:  That depends. If you are lucky, you can see a vivid rainbow across over two peaks. 
[Person1]:  Well, Mike, nowadays there's much talk about nanometer. But what on earth is it?  [Person2]:  Nanometer is a length scale. It's one billionth of a meter, roughly ten times the size of an individual atom.  [Person1]:  Hmm. . . it's hard to figure out the exact size, I'm afraid.  [Person2]:  Well, let's make it this way. For comparison , 10 NM is 1000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair. There are as many nanometers in an inch as there are inches in 400 miles.  [Person1]:  I see. Thank you. 
[Person1]:  I'd like to congratulate you on your wonderful performance. [Person2]:  Thank you very much. [Person1]:  I read about you in the newspaper and decided to come and hear you play. I have travelled many miles and I'm very glad I made the effort. You play the piano beautifully! What are your next plans? [Person2]:  At present I'm giving a lot of concerts. Fortunately, people want to come and hear me play. But I'm getting very tired of traveling. [Person1]:  Why are you working so hard? [Person2]:  I'm planning to start a school, so I'm trying to save as much money as possible. [Person1]:  What kind of school? [Person2]:  A music school for disabled children. I think they have the right to receive education just like any other children. At the moment there are very few such schools in my country. Unfortunately, it will cost a lot of money to start one. [Person1]:  But I'm sure a lot of people will support you. I hope you will be able to realize your dream.
[Person1]:  OK, Mr. Taylor. Let's go ahead and begin. First of all, tell me about your last job? [Person2]:  Well. I worked for 5 years at Hi-Tech Computers. [Person1]:  OK, Hi-Tech. How about your website authoring skills? Oh, we are looking for someone to create and manage our company's website. [Person2]:  Hmm, uh...websites, website. Hmm...I don't think I've read that book. [Person1]:  Huh? And what about the experience with making a flash? [Person2]:  Well. I think sometimes computers flash if that's what you mean. [Person1]:  OK, Mr. Taylor. I think I have all the information I need. [Person2]:  Oh, and I really like computer games. I played them everyday. [Person1]:  Right, right. Thanks, Mr. Taylor. We'll be in touch.
[Person1]:  Have you been to the new Chinese market? [Person2]:  No, I only shop at small local stores. That place looks huge. [Person1]:  You should really go. It has everything you could need to make your Vietnamese food too. They have imported items from several countries. The vegetables are pretty fresh and the meat is of good quality. [Person2]:  But how are the prices? [Person1]:  There are great deals, especially for dried foods. I bought a 10-pound-bag of rice for $5, and I found 2 pounds of special noodles for a dollar. There are hundreds of sauces in jars. I even found a Thai sauce there that I couldn't find anywhere else. I think you'll be very happy with what you find at this market. [Person2]:  Well, I will check it out on Monday. I wonder if they have the pho noodles that I like a lot. [Person1]:  Probably. You should go on Saturday instead. That's when they have the best deals. [Person2]:  I hate crowds. Everyone will be going at that time. [Person1]:  Then try Sunday morning. But I don't think the sales last all weekend.
[Person1]:  Andrew, you are late again. What's the matter? [Person2]:  I got stuck in the heavy traffic. [Person1]:  How long does it take you to come here? [Person2]:  It depends. If I ride my bike, it will take me about 50 minutes. [Person1]:  How about taking the bus? [Person2]:  If I am lucky, I will spend only half an hour on my way. But if it is not my day, it will take almost an hour. [Person1]:  That really wastes a lot of time. Why don't you move to a neighborhood closer to our company? [Person2]:  It is a little far from downtown. [Person1]:  But you will not be late that off in this way. And there is a supermarket near our company. You can buy food or clothes there after work. It is convenient. [Person2]:  Well, that might be a way. But I like to meet my friends after work. Moving here means losing the chance to meet them.
[Person1]:  I'm glad these batteries are on sale. [Person2]:  I'm sorry. These batteries are not on sale. [Person1]:  But that's what the ad said. [Person2]:  I'm sorry. If you look at the ad again, you'll see that the other brand is on sale. [Person1]:  Oh. You're right. I misread the ad. [Person2]:  Yes, many people make that mistake. [Person1]:  Well, you can't blame them. It's a confusing ad. [Person2]:  You're right. Many ads are like that. [Person1]:  Well, as long as I'm here. [Person2]:  Just one second, and I'll give you the batteries that are on sale.
[Person1]:  Hi, Cindy. I thought I'd missed you.  [Person2]:  Oh, I am very sorry, Hans. Thank you for waiting for me. You must have been here a long time already.  [Person1]:  It's all right.  [Person2]:  I was caught in the heavy rain, or I would have come earlier. I am sorry I kept you waiting.  [Person1]:  I was in a comfortable place, so really, it's no problem. I am happy to see you. Did the rain hold you up long?  [Person2]:  Yes. When I came out of the subway, it was raining cats and dogs. And I forgot my umbrella. So I had to wait for the rain to let up.  [Person1]:  I totally understand. 
[Person1]:  Mr. Wang, I've had scheduled for your two days stay in Shanghai. You can make some changes if it does not suit you. [Person2]:  All right. Please read it to me. [Person1]:  On Friday morning, Mr. Wang, the director of Shanghai Research Institute, will visit you at the hotel. In the afternoon, you will discuss some problems with Mr. Yang, vice manager of computer corporation. [Person2]:  Very good. [Person1]:  On Saturday, you'll leave the hotel for sightseeing. Miss Lu will be your guide. [Person2]:  Oh, that's great.
[Person1]:  Good morning everyone. Thank you for attending the meeting today. I'm sure you all have a copy of the agenda. So let's get started with the first issue. [Person2]:  We're here today to present to you the results of our marketing research regarding the consumer behavior. [Person1]:  I would like to begin by introducing our foreign guests to our stuff on your left, we have Mr. Brown, who is Vice President of Sales. Next to him is Ms. Arts, Director of Marketing for the Atlas Company. In the back row is Dr. Barolo, who is visiting from Italy. Thank you all for coming here. [Person2]:  I am glad to see everyone is here and on time. Let's get started! Susan, toss out some of your ideas.
[Person1]:  The air quality in this city is horrendous! The pollution levels were so high that we weren't supposed to go outside with a face mask again! [Person2]:  Exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment. [Person1]:  On top of that, there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs, which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city. [Person2]:  As much as I love this city, I think I'm going to have to find a greener city to live in. Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health. [Person1]:  I know what you mean. However, there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming. If it's not the pollution, then it's the natural disasters, deforestation, or the greenhouse [Person2]:  What is the greenhouse effect exactly? [Person1]:  It's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature. [Person2]:  I see, so it's similar to global warming? [Person1]:  They're related to one another, yes. [Person2]:  I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live. [Person1]:  People joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature, but it's not all good news. They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well. [Person2]:  People always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations. [Person1]:  I think if everyone pitches in, the world will be a better place.
[Person1]:  What seems to be the trouble, Mr. Brown? [Person2]:  I'm in pretty bad shape, Dr. Ford. [Person1]:  Oh, in what way? [Person2]:  No appetite, always on edge, and I can't sleep well. [Person1]:  Did you lose any weight? [Person2]:  Yes, I have lost quite a few pounds since last month. [Person1]:  When was the last time you had a check-up? [Person2]:  About two month ago. [Person1]:  Let me take your blood pressure. You look anemic. [Person2]:  What? Is that very bad? [Person1]:  Well, Mr. Brown, I'm happy to say it's nothing serious. You're just a little run-down from overwork. [Person2]:  What am I supposed to do? [Person1]:  I think all you need is just a vacation. Try to get outdoors more and be sure to get more rest. [Person2]:  Thank you, doctor. I'll do as you say.
[Person1]:  Nice to meet you here. How come you dropped into this company today? [Person2]:  My boss sent me here to take some business documents back to his office. I didn't know you were working here. What a surprise. How long have you been doing this? [Person1]:  Two years or so. [Person2]:  That is great. Do you have to work the night shift? [Person1]:  No, in most cases I don't have to unless there is something urgent to deal with. I work five days a week. [Person2]:  Do you enjoy work here? [Person1]:  It is hard to say. But I've to start by working as a trainee before I really become an experienced marketing assistant. Sometimes, I am really under great pressure when it gets busy. [Person2]:  Take it easy. I'm sure you will gain enough experience while working as a marketing assistant. I hope you haven't been given much trouble in the job. [Person1]:  Luckily not. The cilent I meet are generally very friendly and have a good boss. [Person2]:  Glad to hear that.

[Person1]:  Thank you. Which gate should I go to for the bus? [Person2]:  Go to gate No. 2, please. [Person1]:  Thank you very much. [Person2]:  Don't mention it.
[Person1]:  Nick! How's it going? [Person2]:  Oh, hey. . . [Person1]:  What are you doing in this neighbourhood? Do you live around here? [Person2]:  Actually, my office is right around the corner. [Person1]:  It was great to meet you last week at the conference. I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment. [Person2]:  Yeah, yeah, it was really interesting. You know, I'm in a bit of a hurry, but here's my card. We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion. [Person1]:  Sure, you still have my contact details, right? [Person2]:  You know what, this is really embarrassing, but your name has just slipped my mind. Can you remind me? [Person1]:  Sure, my name is Ana Ferris. Don't worry about it. it happens to me all the time. I'm terrible with names too.
[Person1]:  The new computer software is driving me crazy! I really need a break! [Person2]:  I know what you mean, Carol. I'Ve had nothing but trouble with it. They say it's supposed to be easy! [Person1]:  That's what I'Ve heard. But as far as I'm concerned, it takes a genius to figure it out. Can you pass the sugar, please? [Person2]:  Sure. Why don't you sit down for a minute? You haven't taken a rest all morning.
[Person1]:  Please show me the menu, Miss.  [Person2]:  Of course. Here you are. Can I take your order now?  [Person1]:  Yes. I'd like an Italian soup to start with and then some fried noodles.  [Person2]:  All right. Can I serve you anything else?  [Person1]:  Yes, I'd like another cup of coffee afterwards. Make it hot, please.  [Person2]:  You've got it, sir. 
[Person1]:  Hello, can I speak to Mr. Green? [Person2]:  Yes, speaking. [Person1]:  This is Steven speaking. I'd like to buy a stock. [Person2]:  What stock do you want to buy and how many? [Person1]:  I'd like to buy 1 000 shares of Duson. [Person2]:  Let me get the asking price of the stock. Just a moment. Oh, now the asking price is $ 90 each share. By the way, what is the offering price? [Person1]:  Let me see. The offering price is near or at $ 88. [Person2]:  Then the difference between the asking price and the offering price is $ 2. It's hard to take place today. [Person1]:  Do you mean that I have to buy it at current price? [Person2]:  You can decide by yourself. [Person1]:  I heard that this stock would go up. Hum, I will take it at current price. [Person2]:  So, now I will buy you. Are you sure? [Person1]:  Yes, please.
[Person1]:  I heard you want to apply for the position as a foreign bank staff member, is it true? [Person2]:  Yes, it's true. [Person1]:  What about the foreign bank? [Person2]:  It's a branch of the Bank of America in Beijing. [Person1]:  What are the requirements? [Person2]:  The applicant must be alert and quick at figures, and like meeting the public. [Person1]:  Would you be using English every day in this job? [Person2]:  Yes. Because the customers are mostly Americans. [Person1]:  The pay must be good. [Person2]:  Yes, starting salary is 6, 000 yuan a month plus bonuses.
[Person1]:  Stand back from the door, please. There're plenty of seats in the rear. [Person2]:  What's the fare, please? [Person1]:  One yuan fifty cents. Drop it in the box here. [Person2]:  Is this the right bus to Zizhuyuan Park? [Person1]:  Take a No. 2. This is No. 12. [Person2]:  But somebody told me this was the right bus to take. I want to go to Tian'anmen Square, you see. [Person1]:  Then this is the right bus. Move on, please. You're holding up the passengers. Tian'anmen Square is the last stop but one. [Person2]:  Would you please let me know when we get there?
[Person1]:  I need to buy some fruit. [Person2]:  All the fruit are pretty fresh here. [Person1]:  How much are the pears? [Person2]:  They're four yuan per kilo. [Person1]:  Give me one kilo of those, please. Do you have any fresh plums? [Person2]:  Yes, we do. They are eight yuan per kilo. [Person1]:  It's a bit too expensive. We can get it for six yuan in the shop next here. [Person2]:  Take much and you can have them six yuan per kilo. [Person1]:  Sounds reasonable. I'll take three kilos. [Person2]:  OK. It's 22 yuan [Person1]:  Here you are.
[Person1]:  Hey, let me show you the place. Eh, here's the living room. [Person2]:  Oh, it looks like you could use a new carpet. [Person1]:  Well, I've had a few problems with some former roommates. I know it needs to be cleaned. But I just don't have the money to do it right now. [Person2]:  Oh, and what about the kitchen? [Person1]:  Well, the refrigerator door is broken a little bit, and it won't shut all the way, but it isn't that bad. [Person2]:  How about the bathroom? [Person1]:  Eh, the window needs fixing. [Person2]:  Hey, I think I've seen enough. I can't believe you've survived under these conditions.
[Person1]:  What's that book you just picked up? [Person2]:  The sociology text professor Smith uses in his course. [Person1]:  You had better read it if you want to pass the course. [Person2]:  But it is too expensive. I simply can't afford it. [Person1]:  How much does it cost? [Person2]:  It costs 40 dollars. [Person1]:  Did you check the used book section here? Maybe they have one. [Person2]:  No, they don't. I have asked. [Person1]:  Why don't you get it from the library? [Person2]:  Are you joking? I've been trying for months and the book is always out. There are more than 45 students in the course and every single one wants the book. [Person1]:  Listen, you know my roommate, Henry, don't you? He took the same course last year and I believe he owns the book. I'll ask him if he'll lend it to you. [Person2]:  Oh, Tom, that would settle everything. That's very kind of you. [Person1]:  My pleasure.
[Person1]:  Have you seen Mr. Li? [Person2]:  No, I haven't. Is he looking for me? [Person1]:  Yes, he is. He wants to talk to you. [Person2]:  To me? About what? [Person1]:  There's an opening in the sales department. He wants to talk to you about it. [Person2]:  Oh, that's great! What kind of this job is it? [Person1]:  He hasn't told me exactly. But it will be a better job than this. [Person2]:  Thank you for your help. [Person1]:  Don't thank me yet! He hasn't talked to you and he hasn't chosen you for the job yet. [Person2]:  I know.
[Person1]:  I'm exhausted. My new exercise class is so hard,  [Person2]:  I think it is easy. I could work in your class with no problem.  [Person1]:  You thing so?  [Person2]:  Oh, without a doubt. When is the next class?  [Person1]:  Tomorrw morning. Try it.  [Person2]:  No problem.  [Person1]:  Are you going to this class this morning?  [Person2]:  Of course, easy. No sweat.  [Person1]:  You're no able to move after this class.  [Person2]:  Are you kidding me? It's going to be up a piece of cake. [Person1]:  Well, I don't believe you! [Person2]:  You want to bet? [Person1]:  Yeah, what't the bet? [Person2]:  I bet I can go one hour in your class this morning and not feel a thing.
[Person1]:  Doesn't that cloud look like a bear? [Person2]:  No, it looks like a dog to me. That one over there looks like a bear. [Person1]:  No, it doesn't. That one looks like a cat. [Person2]:  The sun is setting. Let's leave, so we can make it to my mom's on time for dinner. [Person1]:  OK. Where's the car? At the garden gate? [Person2]:  We parked it on the other side of that mountain. [Person1]:  No, I think we parked it behind that hill. [Person2]:  Oh, I see it. It's straight ahead by that tree. [Person1]:  Oh, good. We need to stop and buy some flowers. Your mom loves fresh flowers. [Person2]:  Sure, I need to stop to get gas first though.

Do you have the order number? [Person2]:  Yes, it's 855321. [Person1]:  One moment, please. Alright, sir. I think I discovered what's going on. A couple of the items in your order were damaged during transport. We are in the process of shipping your new items, but it could take up to 10 days for you to receive them.
[Person1]:  . . . So what I think we need to do is ( XXXXXXXXXX ) finish on time. [Person2]:  Sorry, Tom, can you say that last bit again please? We didn't get that. [Person1]:  Oh, OK, I said ( XXXXXXXXXX ) on time. [Person2]:  Sorry Tom, We're having problems hearing you here. It's a bit hissy. Can you hear us? [Person1]:  ( XXXXXXXXXX ) [Person2]:  Hello?

[Person1]:  well, the editor-in-chief heard that I had experience as an editor at another magadize and asked me if I was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him. [Person2]:  really? That's fantastic! Will you get a chance to do any writing? [Person1]:  she said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that I could be in charge of the column until she came back. [Person2]:  wow! That's really great news. How often does the magazine come out? [Person1]:  it's a monthly magazine, but my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly. [Person2]:  are you looking forward to doing more editing work? [Person1]:  yes, but I'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again! [Person2]:  do you have any order forms here so that I can get a subscription to the magazine? [Person1]:  I don't have any with me, but I think I could manage to bring a free copy home for you. [Person2]:  I'm really looking forward to reading your column. [Person1]:  me, too. Do you want to go out to celebrate my good news? [Person2]:  sure, where would you like to go? [Person1]:  perhaps we could go to the library festival that's going on at the local bookshop.
[Person1]:  Shall we share a taxi? [Person2]:  Where are you heading now? [Person1]:  I want to go back to my college on the Huanghe road. It is very close to your house. [Person2]:  Is that the university next to the Teachers' College? [Person1]:  That's the one. [Person2]:  You mean we'll share the taxi? [Person1]:  Yeah. If we share the cab, it'll be cheaper. Besides that your Chinese is better than mine. The drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though I practice my pronunciation carefully. [Person2]:  Well. Don't worry about it, I will be happy to share the taxi with you.
[Person1]:  How do you like Korea? [Person2]:  I like it. It's a beautiful country. [Person1]:  What part of the visit excited you most? [Person2]:  The best island of Korea-Jizhou island. [Person1]:  Why? [Person2]:  Attractive scenery, pleasant climate, these make it charming. [Person1]:  Yes, I think so. But there is also something terrible. [Person2]:  What do you mean? [Person1]:  Sometimes the traffic is too busy. [Person2]:  Yes, you are right.
[Person1]:  Good news. [Person2]:  What's it? [Person1]:  The IOC President Thomas Bach announced the winner just now. [Person2]:  What winner? [Person1]:  Sally Bookworm.

I'll do something for the Winter Olympic Games from now on.
[Person1]:  Tomorrow is Sunday. Let's go out and get some fresh air. [Person2]:  I know there is a beautiful farm in the countryside near Taipei. Are you interested in going there? [Person1]:  why not? I love animals and I love nature. [Person2]:  You can see many cows and horses there. lf you are brave enough, you can try horseback riding. it is fun. [Person1]:  sounds very interesting. I can't wait to go there. [Person2]:  Wow! It is huge and you can do many activities here. [Person1]:  That is true. Some people go camping, some people pick fresh fruit, some people go boating and some people go grass skiing. [Person2]:  I never knew there were so many fun things to do on a farm. [Person1]:  Well, now you know. Let's go to the lake over there. Some people are fishing over there. I haven't had a chance to fish in a lake, I really want to try. [Person2]:  I think we need to buy some baits and borrow some fish poles first. [Person1]:  Yes. we can get what we need at the stands right by the lake. Who do you think will catch a big fish first? [Person2]:  Of course. I will. [Person1]:  Wait and see. I want to try horseback riding after fishing. It looks very exciting and fun. [Person2]:  It is. However, you will suffer from muscle pain for many days you are a first-time rider. [Person1]:  No problem. It is always worth trying something new once in your life time.
[Person1]:  That was really a nightmare! [Person2]:  Honey, what's up? [Person1]:  I was stuck between 15th and 16th floors in the elevator. [Person2]:  Oh, really? I know that telephone signal must have been shielded in the elevator shaft, so what did you do then? [Person1]:  I pressed the emergency button! And then I stayed in the elevator waiting for the rescue. [Person2]:  Did you panic at the time? [Person1]:  A little bit, but I know that the elevator isn't enclosed. at least I wouldn't be smothered there. [Person2]:  Was there anyone else with you? [Person1]:  Of course, there are 6 other people in the elevator ; they were so scared that someone even started crying. [Person2]:  So you mean that you were the only brave one there? [Person1]:  Yes. I have to call the property management. [Person2]:  For what? Complaining about what happened in the elevator? [Person1]:  Yes. They should check the elevator regularly. I have to give them something to remember about, and they should also equip fire extinguishers in the building. [Person2]:  That was just an accident. you are worried too much about it. I think the property management will check the elevator and improve their service from now on. [Person1]:  I know what you mean, but I'd better remind them again, and also remind them to repair the button in the elevator for the disabled people. That has brought the disabled people lots of inconvenience.
[Person1]:  Hello. This is the front desk. What can I do for you? [Person2]:  Hi. I'm calling from Room 209. I couldn't find the TV Guide. Can you send me one, please? [Person1]:  Sure. Anything else? [Person2]:  Yes. There is one more thing. [Person1]:  Go ahead, please. [Person2]:  The mini bar door was open when I checked in. I didn't use it. Could you send someone to check it out? [Person1]:  We'll send someone right up. But don't worry about that. Maybe the service person forgot to do it. [Person2]:  Thanks.
[Person1]:  Hi there, I'm Steve Saunders. What's your name?  [Person2]:  I'm Patti Whitney. Isn't this convention great?  [Person1]:  Yes it is, better than I expected it would be. The presenters have been first rate. Is this the first conference you've been to?  [Person2]:  No, I've been coming for the last 3 years. Each year keeps getting better. Where are you from?  [Person1]:  I'm from Long Island, New York. What about yourself?  [Person2]:  I'm from the other side of the coast--Los Angeles.  [Person1]:  Wow. I really like California. . . the weather there is much better than the East Coast.  [Person2]:  Have you been to California?  [Person1]:  Just once. Quite a few years ago we took the kids to Disneyland on our vacation.They had a blast.  [Person2]:  How many kids do you have?  [Person1]:  Two,a boy and a girl.They're already grown now.  [Person2]:  Well,California's changed over the last little while.You should come back out sometime. 
[Person1]:  Good morning, Mr. Montgomery. I've been sent over from purchasing to fill in for Clare Williams.  [Person2]:  Oh, really? Nice to meet you. I thought they were going to leave me here on my own! How long have you been with the company?  [Person1]:  Oh, about seven years. Time flies, you know!  [Person2]:  Does it ever! Well, let's get started. If you could begin typing this letter now, I'll see what else needs to be done. 
[Person1]:  Good afternoon. Can I help you?  [Person2]:  Yes, I would like to check in.  [Person1]:  Do you have a reservation?  [Person2]:  Yes, my name is Steven Smith. I have a reservation from October 2nd to October 6th. I called last week.  [Person1]:  Wait a moment, please. Oh, yes, Steven Smith. It's for a single room with a bath. Is that right?  [Person2]:  Yes, that's right.  [Person1]:  Now, Mr. Smith, could you fill out this registration form, please?  [Person2]:  OK. By the way, where is the restaurant?  [Person1]:  The restaurant is on the second floor. Here is the key to your room. It's on the 6th floor, room 609. The elevator is over there. And we also have a cafeteria on the top floor, if you would like something to drink, you can also call room service.  [Person2]:  Thank you. 
[Person1]:  Did you catch the mouse yet? I know you wanted to get rid of it before your mom comes to stay with you. [Person2]:  I didn't. 2 weeks of planning and nothing. My mom always wants the house to be clean. I don't want her to know I had a mouse here. She would be so uncomfortable. [Person1]:  Well, the traps usually work if you put peanut butter in them. You can take the mouse out to a field and let it go. [Person2]:  I bought some of those and tried the peanut butter, but it didn't really work. It sure did love that peanut butter though. [Person1]:  Well, how about a trap that has glue on it? You could still let it go later. [Person2]:  I tried that too. But I think this is a very small mouse. It didn't weigh enough to get stuck. [Person1]:  What are you going to do? [Person2]:  Well, I have one day to catch it. If not, I'll have to think of a story to tell mom. She's only here for 7 days. Maybe I can start talking about how I lost my little pet mouse.
[Person1]:  Mike, I'm calling to ask you if you go for a walk with me at the park tonight. [Person2]:  That depends. I will go to the cinema with Tom this afternoon. If I come back early, I will take a walk with you. [Person1]:  When is the movie over? [Person2]:  At about 5 [Person1]:  Well, give me a call around 5
[Person1]:  What's up? You sound a little down in dumps. [Person2]:  I quarreled with my roommate last night. He is really stubborn. [Person1]:  Calm down! Shouting won ' t help? [Person2]:  He is really outrageous. [Person1]:  What happened? [Person2]:  I went back home last night. You know tired as a dog, so I took a quick shower and went to bed. I couldn't fall asleep, because Brian was there in the living room, playing his stupid stereo so loud. I kindly told him to turn that down a little bit. He shouted at me. [Person1]:  What? He can't do this to you. [Person2]:  Well, he did it anyway. Then he came into my room and shot all his shit blah blah blah... you know. [Person1]:  What did you do? [Person2]:  I shouted it back of course. [Person1]:  Hold it, Mike. You won't accomplish anything by hollering at him, right? You worked it all up till now. Why not wait until you cool down a bit? [Person2]:  What would you do if you were in my shoes? [Person1]:  Just stay cool. You know. When you get back home tonight, tell him that you didn't mean to quarrel with him. [Person2]:  No way, Kate. I mean it's just not my fault. [Person1]:  I know. It wouldn't hurt much to say sorry first. And after that, you can casually mention the problem. I am sure he will cooperate. [Person2]:  I am too angry to do that.
[Person1]:  Anna, your wedding day is this weekend. Are you ready? [Person2]:  Yeah, I think so, except for one thing. I'm supposed to wear some special things to the wedding for good luck. [Person1]:  I've thought you were planning to wear a wedding dress. [Person2]:  I am of course, but it says that to have a happy marriage, I have to wear something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue. [Person1]:  I've never heard about that. So what are you going to wear? [Person2]:  Well, for something old, I'm wearing my grandmother's diamond ring. And my wedding dresse is something new and I'm wearing blue flowers in my hair. [Person1]:  OK. That's something old, new, and blue. You still need something borrowed. [Person2]:  Yeah, I just don't know what though. [Person1]:  Hey! How 'bout this? It's my lucky coin. I always wear it inside my shoe when I need good luck. You can borrow it and put it in your shoe during the wedding. [Person2]:  Oh, thanks. Now I'm ready for my wedding day.
[Person1]:  Have you ever been shopping at Whole Foods? [Person2]:  No, I haven't. Is the food good there? [Person1]:  They have the freshest foods there. [Person2]:  I usually shop at Sons. [Person1]:  I used to shop there, but I find the food at Whole Foods to be a lot better. [Person2]:  What's the problem with Sons? [Person1]:  They don't have a lot of organic foods there. [Person2]:  Is there a big selection of organic foods at Whole Foods? [Person1]:  They have lots of healthier food at Whole Foods. [Person2]:  I haven't been shopping there, but maybe I'll try it sometime. [Person1]:  Whole Foods is way better than Sons, trust me. [Person2]:  I'll take your word for it.
[Person1]:  I'm ready to settle the bill. [Person2]:  I hope you enjoyed your stay. [Person1]:  Definitely! Very relaxing. [Person2]:  Good. Right, that comes to $ 1, 500. [Person1]:  What? I only stayed three nights. [Person2]:  That's right, sir. Three nights at 500 dollars a night. . . that comes to $ 1, 500. [Person1]:  But your brochure said that this was a package deal and the hotel's services were all-inclusive. [Person2]:  Yes, of course. The meals and excursions were included in the hotel price. [Person1]:  But why are you overcharging me almost a thousand dollars? 250 dollars a night, times three nights should just be $ 750. [Person2]:  I'm sorry sir. The 250 - dollar rate is based on double occupancy. That means it's 250 per person. The room itself is 500 dollars a night. [Person1]:  Perhaps I could talk to your manager? [Person2]:  Of course. Just a minute ; I'll get her.
[Person1]:  Royal Hotel, can I help you? [Person2]:  Yes. I urgently need a room for tomorrow night, and do you have any vacancies? [Person1]:  Yes, we have. What kind of room would you like? [Person2]:  I'd like a suite with an ocean view, please. [Person1]:  No problem, sir.
[Person1]:  What do you think? [Person2]:  It looks great. [Person1]:  I would like to purchase it. [Person2]:  Will this be cash or charge? [Person1]:  Here, take my credit card. [Person2]:  Just sign here, please. [Person1]:  Sure. Here you go. [Person2]:  Here's your receipt. Have a nice day.
[Person1]:  Hello, Mr. Mayhew. How are you today? [Person2]:  I'm just fine, thanks, Jane. I'd like to make a withdrawal from my Current Account, please. [Person1]:  Would you like a balance inquiry first, Mr. Mayhew? [Person2]:  That might be a good idea, yes. [Person1]:  Your balance is 21, 290 RIB. How much would you like to take out today? [Person2]:  I think 2, 000 RMB will suffice, thanks. [Person1]:  Actually, I have a suggestion for you. We've started a new service called Entrusting Deposit Combination - Have you heard about this? [Person2]:  No, I don't think I have. But I would like to hear the full details, if you think it'll be beneficial to me.
[Person1]:  You are going to work as my office secretary from next Monday. Right now I want to show you the rules of our company. [Person2]:  Thank you for your instruction. I really need to know the rules before I play the game, so I can know more about our company. [Person1]:  The working hours are from 9 [Person2]:  Set your heart at rest. I keep this in my mind. [Person1]:  In my opinion, a secretary must be familiar with office routine and try to do some things by you. This is the filing cabinet and any document or file you may need. And you should file these documents in alphabetical order.
[Person1]:  I like that picture you put up on the wall yesterday. [Person2]:  Oh, thank you. It's a photograph that I took on my vacation last year. [Person1]:  You took it yourself? I didn't know you were a photographer. [Person2]:  Oh, yes, I've been taking pictures for years. [Person1]:  It sounds interesting. Do you have any more of your pictures here? And may I see them? [Person2]:  Yes, certainly. Some of them are faces, just faces of people who I see when I'm walking around. [Person1]:  Do you let them know that you're taking pictures of them? [Person2]:  I try not to. I don't like pictures of people who purpose for the camera. I like people who are going about their business without knowing the camera is there. [Person1]:  I suppose you need a lot of equipment. How many cameras do you have? [Person2]:  Well, I have a dozen of them, but I use two of them more than the others.
[Person1]:  When did you leave for Beijing last Sunday? [Person2]:  Oh, I planned to take the 8 [Person1]:  So you had to take the 10 [Person2]:  Yes. But when I hurried to the railway station, I was told the train would be delayed for fifteen minutes.
[Person1]:  Can you tell that I ' m excited? [Person2]:  What are you excited about? [Person1]:  I voted today. [Person2]:  Was this your first time? [Person1]:  I just turned 18 a month ago. [Person2]:  You ' re lucky. [Person1]:  What do you mean? [Person2]:  Because you turned 18 in an election year. [Person1]:  I didn ' t even think of that. [Person2]:  You didn ' t? [Person1]:  I really didn ' t, but I ' m still excited. [Person2]:  You should be, because you ' re a part of history.
[Person1]:  My disposable contact lenses. They're great for camping!  [Person2]:  Cool! Each contact comes in its own saline solution?  [Person1]:  Yep. They're prescription contacts with UV protection.  [Person2]:  Wow! How high-class. . . a new pair for each day. . .  [Person1]:  You just pop'em in in the morning, take them out at night, and then throw them away. No cleaning!  [Person2]:  Cool. So are you near-sighted or far-sighted?  [Person1]:  Near sighted. 
[Person1]:  Excuse me. [Person2]:  Hello sir, may I help you? [Person1]:  Yes. Can I see that T-shirt on the top shelf please? [Person2]:  Sure. Here it is. [Person1]:  How much does it cost? [Person2]:  50 dollars. [Person1]:  50 dollars. That's too much. [Person2]:  How about this one? It's on sale for only 35 dollars. [Person1]:  I don't like that one. [Person2]:  How about the one next to the black gloves? It's very similar to the one you like. [Person1]:  That's nice. How much is it? [Person2]:  30 dollars. [Person1]:  That'll be fine. [Person2]:  Is this color OK, or would you like a different color? [Person1]:  That blue one's fine. [Person2]:  Do you need any more of these shirts? [Person1]:  Yes. [Person2]:  How many do you want? [Person1]:  I'll take two more, a red one and a white one.
[Person1]:  What is this? I didn't order that. [Person2]:  I'm terribly sorry. May I have your order again? I'll get it right away. [Person1]:  I've ordered savory pork and coleslaw. [Person2]:  I'm sorry. I must have made a mistake. I'll bring them for you at once. [Person1]:  Hey! What is this? [Person2]:  Pardon me, Miss. But didn't you order chicken soup? [Person1]:  Oh, Is that what this is? [Person2]:  I believe so. But if it really bothers you, I'll replace it for you. [Person1]:  No, don't replace it. Give a refund. [Person2]:  Sorry. I'm afraid we can't. But you may order something else instead. [Person1]:  Oh, really? Give me a clam soup. [Person2]:  Okay, Miss. [Person1]:  Thank you. [Person2]:  I hope you enjoy your dinner.
[Person1]:  Hello! [Person2]:  Hello, Lucy. This is John. Could you do me a favor? I've tried to phone my wife six times and I can't get through. The line is busy all the time. Could you possibly go next door and give her a message? [Person1]:  Sure! What do you want to tell Mary? [Person2]:  Could you just say I've met an old friend and I'm staying with him? I'm not in the office now and I'll give her a ring later. [Person1]:  Sure, I'll go right now. [Person2]:  Thanks a lot, Lucy.
[Person1]:  Hey Matt. I just got a job at a consulting firm. [Person2]:  Congratulations. That's great! [Person1]:  I'm so happy. I don't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore. [Person2]:  When do you start? [Person1]:  I start next Monday. [Person2]:  You're going to have to put in a lot of hours you know. [Person1]:  I know. I'm a little nervous, but it's pretty exciting. [Person2]:  I bet. You must be stoked. [Person1]:  Yeah. I'm going to celebrate tonight. Wanna hang out? [Person2]:  Sure. It's on you right? [Person1]:  Of course. How about Toby? Should we call him? [Person2]:  I don't know. He's a little depressed. He's having a hard time finding a job right now. [Person1]:  I should still tell him. In the least, I can refer him to my company. It might help. [Person2]:  That sounds like a good idea.
[Person1]:  May, could you bring this note to Professor Li for me today? [Person2]:  Sure, no problem. Asking for leave again? You have been absent from class five times this semester. [Person1]:  I know. But attending Miss Li's class is just waste of time. No more than one third of her students will go to her class. [Person2]:  I agree that Miss Li doesn't teach so well. Most students either sleep or do other things in her class. [Person1]:  Yeah, my boyfriend plays the video game every time in class with me. Or I chat with my friends through text messages. [Person2]:  Fortunately her class is just an elective course, not as important as compulsory courses. [Person1]:  Right, so we must spare some time to attend selective courses. [Person2]:  But isn't it too impolite to be absent? [Person1]:  What can I do? I have things to do in Students'Government. [Person2]:  Oh, I thought you just gave an excuse on this note. [Person1]:  Sometimes I will try various excuses. But this is my last time asking for leave. Or I will have a bad record. [Person2]:  Yeah, besides, your credit will be deducted. That is kind of serious. [Person1]:  I have been absented from many classes this semester just because of my work in the Students'Government. [Person2]:  You can't write with one hand and draw with the other. [Person1]:  I am thinking about quitting my job in the student government. But before that, I must do my job. Bye. Don't forget about that note. [Person2]:  You can count on me.
[Person1]:  You got a letter in the mail. [Person2]:  Give it to me. [Person1]:  What is it? [Person2]:  It's my acceptance letter from UCLA. [Person1]:  What does it say? [Person2]:  I'Ve been accepted! [Person1]:  Are you serious? [Person2]:  I'm serious. [Person1]:  Good for you! [Person2]:  NYU was my first choice, but UCLA is just fine. [Person1]:  I'm so proud of you. [Person2]:  Thanks. I'm proud of myself, too.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, you look familiar. Did you use to live in New York? [Person2]:  Yes. [Person1]:  Did you use to work at NYU? [Person2]:  Yes, I did. [Person1]:  Oh, did you know Hugh Young? He was a music student. [Person2]:  Hugh Young? Didn't he use to wear a funny yellow jacket all the time? [Person1]:  Yes. And he used to play the piano with a jazz group at the university. [Person2]:  I remember Hugh. Most people thought he was a little. . . uh. . . peculiar. Do you know what he's doing now? [Person1]:  Yes, he's a millionaire in Houston now. [Person2]:  A millionaire? As a jazz musician? [Person1]:  Oh, no. He's an executive for a large computer company. I saw an interview with him on TV yesterday. They were asking his opinion about future uses for computers. [Person2]:  Well! I guess people don't find him so peculiar anymore.
[Person1]:  How did you get it? [Person2]:  I found it a garage sale once. [Person1]:  What a find! So, how much does it cost? [Person2]:  Well, because I like you. . . ninety bucks. [Person1]:  Ninety dollars is pretty steep. I'll take it for sixty bucks.
[Person1]:  Please send this memo out to all the managerial staff. . . there will be training for all the department heads next week. Attendance for managerial staff is mandatory, except for the financial department. Financial officers may participate if their schedules allow. [Person2]:  You would like me to send this to all managerial staff? I'm sorry, sir, could you please clarify? Who all is included in managerial staff? [Person1]:  Managerial staff is anyone who is in a position of authority or responsibility, or who has anyone working under them. It includes all supervisors and department heads. [Person2]:  What about the senior account managers? Do they count? [Person1]:  No, they are in a position of leadership and have more experience than normal account managers, but they do not directly supervise others. They are not members of the managerial staff and will not be included in our training.
[Person1]:  Good afternoon. Thank you for the opportunity to interview for this position. [Person2]:  Hello, have a seat. I'm Bill Gotcha. I am assuming you found your way here with no trouble? [Person1]:  Actually, I am very familiar with the area so there was absolutely no problem. [Person2]:  I am curious as to why you want to leave your current employer. [Person1]:  I am interested in switching fields. [Person2]:  Do you feel that you are exceptionally good at anything in particular. [Person1]:  I am good at pulling together teams of people to accomplish a task. [Person2]:  What are you not good at? [Person1]:  I am impatient with myself at times and am hard on myself. [Person2]:  We appreciate hearing that about you!
[Person1]:  Ma'am, I hear you have an apartment for rent, can I take a look at it? [Person2]:  Sure, you're welcome any time by appointment, but I have to tell you the building is close to a railways. And if you can't put up with the noise you might as well save the trip.
[Person1]:  Hi, John. [Person2]:  Oh! Hi, Laura. What are you doing here? [Person1]:  Uh, I'm usually here on weekends. It's my uncle's shop. So you are looking for a bike? [Person2]:  Yeah. Now that the weather is warming up, I thought I should get some exercise instead of taking the bus all the time. [Person1]:  Well, that's a good idea and you come to the right place. Do you know what you like? [Person2]:  Well, I don't want a racer or a touring bike or anything like that. Mostly I'll just be using it to get me back and forth from work. [Person1]:  How far is that? [Person2]:  About four miles. [Person1]:  Are there a lot of hills on the way? [Person2]:  Some, I guess. But maybe I should tell you at first that I only got 150 dollars. Can I get anything decent for that? [Person1]:  Well, you are not going to get anything on the top of the line. But we do have a few trade-ins in the back that are in good condition. [Person2]:  That sounds good. [Person1]:  And you are right. For the kind of ride you are going to be doing, the most important thing is comfort. You want to make sure it's the right height for you? Follow me and I'll show you what we've got.
[Person1]:  It's seven o'clock already. Mary should be home by now. [Person2]:  Oh. I forgot to tell you that she called this afternoon and told me that she was going to a party at her classmate's house and wouldn't be home until 10.
[Person1]:  Hello, Nancy. This is Bob. How are you? [Person2]:  Fine, thank you. A hit too busy though. You know, I'm trying to put everything in order in my new flat. [Person1]:  Oh, I see. Well, I am wondering if you'd like to go to a concert tomorrow night. I think it will be good. And if I remember correctly, you did say you liked country music. [Person2]:  Yes. That's fight. It's nice of you to ask, Bob. But I don't think I can. Mother has already asked me to see a friend and then we'll go to the theatre together. In fact she's getting the tickets this evening. [Person1]:  Oh, well, never mind. What about next weekend? This concert is still on then, I think, if you are free next Saturday. [Person2]:  Oh, I'd like to very much. But what time exactly? [Person1]:  It starts at 7 [Person2]:  Oh, good. That'll be fine. The tennis match will be over by 5 o'clock, I'm sure. [Person1]:  Good, I'll call you again when I get the tickets. [Person2]:  Sure. Bye.
[Person1]:  I've heard that you are going to call for a tender. What kind of goods would you like to buy? [Person2]:  Yes, we're ready to start the invitation to tender. You're well informed. We'd like to build new factory. [Person1]:  When do you open the tender? And where? [Person2]:  We intend to open the tender at first next month in Beijing. [Person1]:  And when is the closing date? [Person2]:  The time period is set on June 29th. [Person1]:  Could you please tell me something more about the conditions for the tender? [Person2]:  All right. The area of the factory buildings is around 8, 000 square meters. You can read the details in the invitations which will be sent tomorrow. [Person1]:  Thank you for your information. [Person2]:  You're welcome. [Person1]:  I'm sorry to have taken up too much of your time. [Person2]:  It doesn't matter. We'll be in touch. [Person1]:  Okay, bye! [Person2]:  Bye!
[Person1]:  Wow, you look like a drowned rat. Didn't you know there's a thunderstorm today? [Person2]:  I knew there would be a rain, but I didn't expect it would rain cats and dogs today. [Person1]:  Well, you'd better take a hot shower right now, or you'll catch a cold. [Person2]:  You are right. I don't want to get sick. Could you put my wet clothes into the washing machine? [Person1]:  No problem.
[Person1]:  Mrs. Jane. For the past 3 weeks I have not been satisfied with your work. [Person2]:  I'm sorry. What do you mean? why? [Person1]:  Well, your manager told me you're turning your reports in 2 to 3 days late. You're often absent from staff meetings and you haven't been getting along with your colleagues. [Person2]:  Look Mister Travers that I explain... [Person1]:  Mrs. Jean I know you have been with us for a while now, but this business is changing fast. We need People who can keep up and work as a team. [Person2]:  Mister Travers my mother has been ill. She is suffering from stomach cancer. I've been spending all my time outside of work at the hospital with her and I've even had to leave work early a few times to take care of her. I've been so tired and... [Person1]:  Oh, I had no idea Miss Jane. [Person2]:  I know my work has suffered these past few weeks. But I promise I will make up for it. [Person1]:  Listen. Why don't you take a couple of days off? It's much more important that you be with your mother while she is recovering. [Person2]:  Really sir? Thank you so much. [Person1]:  Of course, just look after your mother and then come back to work when she's better.
[Person1]:  I really like those trousers, but I'm afraid I don't have much cash with me. Is there a cash point near here please? [Person2]:  Yes, it's not far, go out of the shop turn right then right again into avenue Dissuade, go up the street to the corner and there on the corner on your right is the cash point next to the bank. There's a cafe opposite the road. [Person1]:  Next to the bank. Yes, of course, thank you. [Person2]:  You're welcome.
[Person1]:  Now, this get together we're having at club mango. [Person2]:  Yes, that's right. [Person1]:  It's not my favorite place. Couldn't we think of somewhere better? [Person2]:  Well, the other seemed to be happy enough with it. [Person1]:  The trouble is, it's so noisy there that you can't really have any sort of conversation and surely that's the point of us all getting together. [Person2]:  So what? You don't want to come? [Person1]:  That's not what I said. I just rather meet up somewhere else. I'm sure we could come up with a better place if we give it some thought.
[Person1]:  Hi, I've only just arrived. [Person2]:  Oh, good. Now here are the keys. Let's go in. There are 2 apartments. The one for rent is on the right. Do come in. [Person1]:  Thank you. I like the carpet. The color is nice, isn't it? [Person2]:  Yes, and this apartment is in good condition. Here is your lounge. [Person1]:  Where would we eat? [Person2]:  There is this corner here, or you can use your kitchen. Come and see. [Person1]:  The kitchen is quite small. [Person2]:  Yes, but it has everything, cooker, fridge, even a dishwasher. [Person1]:  And there are lots of cupboards. [Person2]:  Let me show you the bedrooms. This is the smaller one. [Person1]:  It's a good size, though. [Person2]:  Now come into the other bedroom. You can see the bathroom too. [Person1]:  Yes, it is very nice. But I will have to ask my friend first and we will come together. I understand it is $800 a month. [Person2]:  Yes, but a few blocks downtown would be much more expensive. [Person1]:  Well, thank you. I will be in touch.
[Person1]:  Hello. [Person2]:  Hello, Sam. It's me, Jane. My uncle hasn't been well these days. I'm going to see him the day after tomorrow. [Person1]:  Oh, really? Where does he live? [Person2]:  He lives in Dalian. And I'm going there by train because I don't like the bus. [Person1]:  How long will the train journey take? [Person2]:  Well, the train leaves at 6 [Person1]:  Who will meet you at the station? [Person2]:  My aunt is going to meet me. She can drive. [Person1]:  What is the weather like there? [Person2]:  It is cold and wet. [Person1]:  I hope you have a good journey. [Person2]:  Thanks a lot, Sam. See you soon. [Person1]:  Bye.
[Person1]:  Is the weather in San Francisco so bad all the time in the fall? [Person2]:  Yeah, but this is a typical autumn. It gets worse though, at least it's not raining that much. [Person1]:  That's too bad. [Person2]:  You'll get used to it. In the mean time, you'll have to watch a lot of movies, seems like the only thing to do with the bad weather. [Person1]:  Too expensive. Can you believe how much movies cost these days? [Person2]:  Yeah, it's crazy. It's like $9 a movie. [Person1]:  Unless it's a date, I'm not going to pay that much to watch a movie.
[Person1]:  What do you think about the equipment in our company? [Person2]:  We have to equip our company with a network of work stations at every office and show room as soon as possible. [Person1]:  I also realized this issue. And office automation is essential. [Person2]:  Besides, Internet tends to be more essential now in the information age. [Person1]:  Good idea. A network of work stations is helpful for our management. [Person2]:  And, to be frank, our copying machines are too slow ; our telephone system is limited in function. [Person1]:  You are right. The current equipment of our offices really falls behind. Next week, you can provide me a catalogue of new equipment.
[Person1]:  How can I help you this afternoon? [Person2]:  I want to take out some money, but there's a massive queue for the ATM so I thought I'd do it over the counter. [Person1]:  Unfortunately, an ATM is being refilled because it ran out of money. That's what's causing the hold up. [Person2]:  Oh, I see. I thought maybe it was just the time of the day, although it isn't usually busy at 2 [Person1]:  You are right, you've just missed the lunchtime rush. Could you fill out a withdrawal slip, please? [Person2]:  I did that already, while I was waiting. Also, here's my card. [Person1]:  Thank you. And you require. . . [Person2]:  800 RIB, please. [Person1]:  Please enter your personal code right here, on the key pad. And sign here, please. [Person2]:  OK. . . [Person1]:  Thank you. Here's your card back and your money. Please double check it for me. [Person2]:  Yes, that's great. Thanks.
[Person1]:  Would you like to play golf with me? [Person2]:  I would like to. but I'm not good at it. [Person1]:  It doesn't matter. I will teach you. [Person2]:  That's great! When will we go? [Person1]:  Tomorrow morning. [Person2]:  All right. What should I take? [Person1]:  Just take your golf club. I will pick you up tomorrow. [Person2]:  Thanks. I will wait for you at my home. [Person1]:  Well, see you tomorrow.
[Person1]:  Hi, Mike, what gives? [Person2]:  Hi, Bill, this is my new car. [Person1]:  Hey, great set of wheels. [Person2]:  You like it, huh? [Person1]:  Who wouldn't? Wow, that's out of this world. [Person2]:  It is special, isn't it? [Person1]:  Yeah, too cool. How much did they sold you for? [Person2]:  Lots. Looks like I'll have to moonlight for the next two years. [Person1]:  I can imagine. [Person2]:  Hey, let's go for a spin. You can try it out. [Person1]:  I'd love to. [Person2]:  Ok, let's go.
[Person1]:  My goodness! You're kidding! [Person2]:  No. I'm serious. I'm going to quit my job. [Person1]:  That's amazing! You got a good pay here, didn't you? [Person2]:  It's true. But I can't show my abilities. [Person1]:  Come on! Don't be silly! [Person2]:  Your present job is something better. Why do you change? [Person1]:  Well. How do you know?
[Person1]:  Nice to see you ; how have you been feeling lately? [Person2]:  I have been feeling great, Dr. Smith. [Person1]:  I am happy that you have decided to come in for your annual physical. [Person2]:  Yes, I am going on a cross-country bike ride on vacation and want to make sure that I don't have any problems. [Person1]:  We are going to look at your heart and lungs, do a few blood tests, and see that your eyes, ears, and nose are all working as they should. [Person2]:  I'Ve been having trouble with congestion in my chest. Can you give me some tests for that? [Person1]:  I can do a chest X-ray to check for congestion. [Person2]:  That would be great. What is the blood test for? [Person1]:  The blood test is for cholesterol, white blood cell count, and blood sugar. [Person2]:  I have been feeling great. I don't imagine that any of my tests will turn out badly.
[Person1]:  Dad, I've finished my homework. [Person2]:  Well, what game do you want to play? [Person1]:  Do you want to play poker? [Person2]:  Do you know how to play it? [Person1]:  I'll teach you. [Person2]:  OK. Teach me how to play the game.
[Person1]:  Hi, Nancy. How are you doing? [Person2]:  Hi, Tom. Want a cup of coffee? [Person1]:  Not right now. I've got to get another car and my old one is blown up. [Person2]:  Oh, hey, did you look in the classified ads? [Person1]:  You mean used cars? [Person2]:  No, Ah. . . single sellers. [Person1]:  Well, yeah, but I'd be getting somebody else's problems. [Person2]:  Uh huh. How about a used car? They've got good ones now. [Person1]:  It's the same kind of deal though, you know, you never know what you're going to get. [Person2]:  Oh, hey, how about a new car? They've got easy loans now. You'd feel so good driving a new car. [Person1]:  Let's look at them all. Have you got a paper there?
[Person1]:  Some of them seem to be of the latest style. Now I'Ve a feeling that we can do a lot of trade in this line. We wish to establish relations with you. [Person2]:  Your desire coincides with ours. [Person1]:  Concerning our financial position, credit standing and trade reputation, you may refer to Bank of Hong Kong, or to our local Chamber of Commerce or inquiry agencies. [Person2]:  Thank you for your information. As you know, our corporation is a state-operated one. We always trade with foreign countries on the basis of equality and mu - dual benefit. Establishing business relations between us will be to our mutual benefit. I have no doubt that it will bring about closer ties between us. [Person1]:  That sounds interesting. I'll send a fax home. As soon as I receive a definite answer, I'll make a specific inquiry. [Person2]:  We'll then make an offer as soon as possible. I hope a lot of business will be conducted between us. [Person1]:  So do I.
[Person1]:  May, we are fools to hang out at noon. It's dying hot today. My skin is too weak to be exposed under the summer sun.  [Person2]:  Do you have any sunscreen lotion?  [Person1]:  You know, honey, I used it all on the way over.  [Person2]:  I think I'm getting a heart stroke.  [Person1]:  The heat is driving crazy and I hate my new hat.  [Person2]:  Why? It's brand new, and it's perfect on you.  [Person1]:  But I bought it to get rid of the heat. Now it does nothing but burning my head.  [Person2]:  Beauty costs, honey.  [Person1]:  Laugh all you want, whatever. We need to get out of the heat.  [Person2]:  Walking under the sun is certainly not the way.  [Person1]:  Give me a break. It's not funny.  [Person2]:  Right. Sorry. Anyway, the radio said that it'll rain later today.  [Person1]:  Hope so! Good thing is that autumn is just around the corner. 
[Person1]:  There are two things that you'll need to know.  [Person2]:  What are they?  [Person1]:  The school has three lunch periods, and the kids are divided into three groups to go to lunch.  [Person2]:  Wow!  [Person1]:  Furthermore, when you are dismissed in the afternoon, you will be divided into two waves.  [Person2]:  Two waves?  [Person1]:  The school parking lot is not big enough for all the school buses to come in at one time. So only half the buses come in first to pick up the first wave's students.  [Person2]:  And the other half come in later to pick up the second wave. 
[Person1]:  What kinds of Tv programes do you enjoy watching?  [Person2]:  I like current affairs programes and documentaries, especially wildlife ones. How about you?  [Person1]:  I like those kinds of programes too. They're very informative. I think that many people underrate the education value of Tv.  [Person2]:  I agree. People often criticize Tv for showing too much sex and violence.  [Person1]:  Yeah. And that's so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational!  [Person2]:  Right. You can't blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programes. They need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programes.  [Person1]:  In my country, there's a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown. I think it's about six minutes per hour.  [Person2]:  That's great idea. But don't the Tv station lose a lot of money because of that?  [Person1]:  No. they don't. they simply charge higher prices at peak times. Is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on Tv in your country?  [Person2]:  Not as far as I know. We have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes! That's one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable Tv, where you pay a fixed amount each month.  [Person1]:  Some people have satellite and cable Tv in my country, but people don't seem to keen to pay for their Tv programes. Besides, the terrestrial channels offer a good range of programes.  [Person2]:  Well, there's a wildlife documentary on Tv in a few minutes. Shall we? 
[Person1]:  You'd better prepare for the examination. [Person2]:  I don't think the exam will be very hard. [Person1]:  You should change your attitude, or you will not pass the course. [Person2]:  Maybe you're right. I have been too lazy lately.
[Person1]:  Oh, God. It's late. I'm afraid I have to leave.  [Person2]:  But you just got here. Can't you stay a little longer and have some tea?  [Person1]:  That's very kind of you. But if I don't go now I'll miss the last bus.  [Person2]:  That's too bad.  [Person1]:  Thank you for your hospitality.  [Person2]:  Thanks for coming.  [Person1]:  How about next time we meet at my place? And I'll treat you to Chinese food. I know how much you like it. We can order in and watch video too. Anything you like, I promise.  [Person2]:  Great idea. I'm looking forward to it. See you then.  [Person1]:  Well. I really do have to go.  [Person2]:  Good night then.  [Person1]:  See you tomorrow. 
[Person1]:  Which season do you like best?  [Person2]:  I like spring best. It is neither too cold nor too hot. Freezing days make me lazy and stuffy days make me lazier. How about you?  [Person1]:  I prefer summer, especially the summer evenings. When the sun comes down, it is so nice to take a walk and breathe. After a rain shower, the smell of the air is refreshing. It is also a best reason for ice-cream.  [Person2]:  How do you get through the stuffy daytime?  [Person1]:  Well, I have to hide in the air-conditioned rooms. Anyway, it is all worth, just think about the cool evening time. 
[Person1]:  Room Reservations. Good afternoon.  [Person2]:  I'd like to book a double room for December 4th.  [Person1]:  That's fine, sir. A double room for December 4th, right?  [Person2]:  Yes. What is the rate, please?  [Person3]:  The current rate is 35 dollars per night a room. [Person2]:  What services come with that?  [Person1]:  You'll have a radio, a color television, a telephone and a newspaper delivered to your room every day.  [Person2]:  That sounds not bad. I'll take it.  [Person1]:  How long will you be staying?  [Person2]:  From the evening of December 4th to the morning of December 7th.  [Person1]:  That'll be three nights. Could you tell me your name, please?  [Person2]:  Yes, this is Bill.  [Person1]:  And what is your telephone number, please?  [Person2]:  (0211) 268 4563.  [Person1]:  (0211) 2678 4563. Thank you vary much, and we look forward to seeing you on December 4th.  [Person2]:  Great. That's all. Goodbye.  [Person1]:  Goodbye. 
[Person1]:  Jack, how have your two sons been doing at school recently? [Person2]:  Don't ask. Mark never start studying and Jason never stop studying. [Person1]:  You are joking. I heard that Jason is likely to be at the top of his class after his exams this year. [Person2]:  Yes, so his teachers say he's been buried in his books every evening for months on end recently. He is hoping to go to Harvard University. [Person1]:  Great. Maybe he'll become a university professor himself in the future. [Person2]:  Maybe, but sometimes I wish he'd go out and enjoy himself for a change. [Person1]:  How about the younger one? [Person2]:  Well, Mark's teachers say he has ability, but he rarely does his best. He does his homework in 10 minutes every day and then rushes out to play football. [Person1]:  But he can make his fortune at football. People can make a lot of money from sports now. [Person2]:  My wife always worries about their future. She wants Mark to study law. I don't believe in forcing them. But I wonder how Mark will progress over the next few years. [Person1]:  Perhaps you, you can have a talk with him now to find out what he's thinking about his studies and future plans. [Person2]:  Good idea. I'll take your advice.
[Person1]:  How about you, Chuck? Where did you grow up? [Person2]:  Well, I was born in Ohio, but I grew up in Texas. [Person1]:  And when did you come to Los Angeles? [Person2]:  In 1978. I went to college here. [Person1]:  Oh. What was your major? [Person2]:  Drama. I was an actor for five years after college. [Person1]:  That's interesting. So why did you become a hairdresser? [Person2]:  Because I needed the money. And because I was good at it. Look! What do you think?
[Person1]:  Car trouble center. How may I help you? [Person2]:  My car won't start! Stupid old car! [Person1]:  Hold on, before you kick your car let's go through some possible problems. [Person2]:  Fine. [Person1]:  OK, first of all, can you turn the key in the ignition? [Person2]:  Yeah! I am here with my friend and he thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter motor. [Person1]:  Those are possible problems, but tell me, when you turn the key, do you hear the starter motor crank? [Person2]:  Yeah, it sounds like it usually does when I start the car, but nothing else happens. The engine won't start. Should I maybe press the accelerator? [Person1]:  No. If you step on the accelerator pedal you can flood the carburetor and your car will never start. [Person2]:  So what do you think it is? [Person1]:  I know this may seem like a silly question, but does your car have gasoline? [Person2]:  Umm. yeah! Right! I got the car started! Thanks for your help! I told you to fill the tank!
[Person1]:  Good morning, madam. Can I help you? [Person2]:  I want to buy some cleansing milk. What would you recommend? [Person1]:  Your complexion is on the oily side. I suggest you use cleansing gel. [Person2]:  Anything that can keep my skin clean will do. [Person1]:  How do you prefer this one? It cleans thoroughly without striping your natural protective oil. The gentle formula keeps skin soft and healthy. [Person2]:  Hm. . . the smell is too strong, I can't stand it. I'm very sensitive to fragrance. [Person1]:  We've also got a fragrance-free one, specially designed for sensitive skin. I'm sure you'll like it. [Person2]:  I'll try that. Do you have facial cream to go with that? [Person1]:  Yes, sure. This line of products is fragrance-free. We have a facial mask, moisturizing lotion, eye cream and tonic. [Person2]:  I'll buy the moisturizing lotion and cleansing gel first. If they suit me, I'll come back for the others later. [Person1]:  Thank you very much, madam. Here are some samples of our products. Do try them out.
[Person1]:  Tom and Helen got married at last. [Person2]:  How did you know that? I heart Tom's father didn't agree with that. [Person1]:  I was invited to attend their wedding. [Person2]:  It's great. Although his father didn't agree with that, Tom went through with it. [Person1]:  How moving love is.
[Person1]:  I'm thinking about redecorating my bedroom. I bought this magazine in order to get some ideas. What do you think of this? [Person2]:  That looks good. The room in the picture is bigger than your bedroom, so you wouldn't be able to put all the furniture in your room. [Person1]:  I'd like to have the bad and the wardrobe. [Person2]:  You would fit both of them in your bedroom. Perhaps you could also get the dressing table. I think that one would look good in your bedroom. [Person1]:  Yes, it would. It's very expensive though. [Person2]:  Everything in this magazine seems expensive. You could probably find something similar in a discount furniture store. [Person1]:  Yes. I'm sure I could find something similar at one. I'd also like to get a new carpet for my bedroom. [Person2]:  You can get cheap carpets easily. Another idea is to buy a rug. That would cover a lot of the carpet and you wouldn't have to replace the carpet. It would save you a lot of work. [Person1]:  That's a good idea. I'm really looking forward to redoing my bedroom.
[Person1]:  Now, Miss Childs passed on your resume to me and I'Ve had the chance to look it over and I must say I'm quite impressed. [Person2]:  Thank you very much. I'Ve tried to keep it short and clear. If there's any questions please feel free to ask me. [Person1]:  Well yes, I do have a number of questions, but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview I'd like to get a little bit of an idea of your background. [Person2]:  Yes, of course. Well as you can see from the resume I'm 27 and grew up in Brooklyn, New York, although our family moved to London when I was quite young, at around 16. [Person1]:  Ah I see, so you were actually educated in Europe? [Person2]:  Yes precisely. Although I was born in the US, I would definitely call London home. But as you see I'Ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country. My Father was in the oil business [Person1]:  Very interesting. So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood. [Person2]:  Absolutely! We were never still for too long. But now I'm really looking to settle down. [Person1]:  I see. Okay, well let's move on to discuss your education shall we? [Person2]:  Sure.
[Person1]:  Tomorrow I will be the new owner of all dad's assets. [Person2]:  It still feels really strange to me. [Person1]:  I know. I miss him terribly. [Person2]:  How does it feel to be in charge of so much money? [Person1]:  I thought I would feel like I was in the lap of Luxury. [Person2]:  I guess you could choose that if you wanted. [Person1]:  No, I think I will run things much the same way that Dad did. [Person2]:  Dad really knew what he was doing when he chose you to take over for him when he was gone!
[Person1]:  Our supervisor Lester does. Actually, Lester is kind of like the kitchen god. [Person2]:  The kitchen god? What does he do? [Person1]:  He just stays in the kitchen and watches you. Before the Chinese New Year, the kitchen god tells his boss whether you were good or bad this year. Just like Lester does! [Person2]:  Oh, no! I did a lot of bad things this year. I hope the kitchen god isn't like Lester--he blabs my mistakes to everybody! [Person1]:  Actually, there's a way to keep the kitchen god from telling the bad things you did. [Person2]:  What is it? Tell me! Will it work for Lester, too? [Person1]:  I think so! Just serve a lot of sweet dishes next week. That will make the kitchen god say sweet things about you! [Person2]:  Hmm. Are you sure that will work? I already tried giving chocolate to Lester. [Person1]:  And what happened? [Person2]:  His face broke out and he said it was my fault!
[Person1]:  How does the political system work in your country? [Person2]:  We have hundreds of constituencies and the votes in each one elect a member of parliament. Most people call them mp's. [Person1]:  Each mp belongs to a political party, right? [Person2]:  Almost all of them do. A few are independent. That means that they do not belong to a party. If one party more than half of the mp's. they form a government. That means that they choose a prime minister can cabinet members. [Person1]:  What's a cabinet? [Person2]:  This is a small group of people-perhaps 25 mp's who are usually ministers. They make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy. [Person1]:  Can any mp make a law? [Person2]:  Any mp can present a law to parliament. The proposed law is debated and voted on. If it is accepted, it becomes law. [Person1]:  I suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties. [Person2]:  Yes, it does, because they have most of the mp's. most mp's vote the way their party wants them to. [Person1]:  How do people choose which party or candidate to vote for? [Person2]:  They produce manifesto. These documents which states their policies. Some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election. Votes who often change the party they vote for are called floating voters.
[Person1]:  Hey! Fred, you are five minutes earlier than me today. Usually, you don't. [Person2]:  Hurry! It is time for me to steal something. [Person1]:  What's your meaning? [Person2]:  I am stealing vegetables at the Happy Farm. [Person1]:  You are a thief? [Person2]:  No, no. I mean stealing vegetables on Internet is very popular now. Many white collars join in this game and have a lot of fun by stealing others'vegetables. [Person1]:  You mean it is a still virtual game. Your friends steal your vegetables time and time again, and you take theirs as well, right? [Person2]:  You got what I meant. Perhaps, what I steal are not vegetables, but loneliness. [Person1]:  Don't be addicted to the game. It's not good for your job.
[Person1]:  Hello, this is the 911 emergency operator. [Person2]:  Help! Help! Please, help me! [Person1]:  Sir, please calm down and explain exactly what is happening. [Person2]:  Calm down? My car broke down on the freeway! I have a woman passenger and she's about to have a baby! [Person1]:  Relax, sir, and explain exactly where you are. [Person2]:  I'm in the southward lane of the Lincoln freeway, about 15 miles from the Washington tunnel. [Person1]:  Okay. Now, what's the nearest landmark to your location? [Person2]:  Um, I see a Starbucks... [Person1]:  Is there anyone else with you? [Person2]:  No, no one will stop to help us! I need an ambulance. I feel like I'm about to have a heart attack myself! [Person1]:  I just sent an ambulance to your location. They should be there soon.
[Person1]:  Did you get a present for Molly's birthday? [Person2]:  Yes, she loves to listen to Johnny Holden's music. And she's got all his CDs. Then I saw this book that introduces Johnny Holden's life, so I got her this. [Person1]:  Great idea!
[Person1]:  He's honest, hardworking and responsible. I simply can't find any shortcoming of his as an employee.  [Person2]:  I rather doubt it. You're cheated by his appearance, I think.  [Person1]:  Don't be so jealous. He never speaks ill of you before me. 
[Person1]:  Do you speak only English in the class, or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish? [Person2]:  Oh, we never speak Spanish in class! Miss. Parker speaks to us only in English. [Person1]:  I suppose she's right. Does she speak English very slowly? [Person2]:  Not always. Sometimes we don't understand her. Then she has to repeat what she said. [Person1]:  It must be interesting to study English. [Person2]:  Mario and I are the best students in the class. Miss. Parker says that my pronunciation is very good. [Person1]:  Is English pronunciation easy or difficult? [Person2]:  Sometimes it's difficult. Some words look different from the way one pronounces them.
[Person1]:  Francis, you have done an outstanding work in the past six months. In view of your achievement, I trust you're now indispensable part of our company and you deserve an officer director title. [Person2]:  I am so happy to know that I could make some contribution to our company. [Person1]:  This title does not only give you a raising pay-check, but also increase responsibilities. Congratulations, and hope the best for you. [Person2]:  Thank you, I will be doing my best.
[Person1]:  . . . Now that we have been over the gory details of our disastrous first quarter, Ed! Give us some good news. How are things looking for us in terms sales this month? [Person2]:  Uh well. . . would you like the bad news first or the really bad news? [Person1]:  What? Ed, don't tell me you only have bad news! [Person2]:  Well sir, our sales have dropped, no plunged, fifty percent in the past month alone. We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits refalling fast. The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory, or getting rid of our staff. If we consider redundancies, it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages. It's a real mess. [Person1]:  For crying out loud. . . How fast are we losing money? [Person2]:  Um. . . how can I put this? Let's just say that at this pace, we will be filing for Chapter eleven in less than three months. [Person1]:  What! Geez! How could this have happened? So what's the bad news? [Person2]:  Oh, that's the really bad news. Our supplier suffered QC problems and, well, half of our production is faulty. We're going to have to recall all itemssold in the last quarter. And the worst part? We're going to have to shoulder this cost. [Person1]:  Are you joking? Get the supplier on the line now! They have to assume the costs of this mess! [Person2]:  We tried that, sir. The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country. [Person1]:  We're doomed! [Person2]:  There is some really good news though! [Person1]:  Really? What! [Person2]:  I got offered a new job!
[Person1]:  Hi! Ed, what's up? [Person2]:  Nothing. [Person1]:  Doesn't look like it to me. [Person2]:  Just get out of my face! [Person1]:  Woo, easy. [Person2]:  Leave me alone! [Person1]:  What are you so ticked off about? [Person2]:  I don't want to talk about it. [Person1]:  Maybe I can help. [Person2]:  I blew the finally exam. [Person1]:  You've got to be joking. [Person2]:  No, I'm not. [Person1]:  Well, don't get bend on a ship about it.
[Person1]:  Are the expressions of sight draft, time draft, usance draft and letter of credit adequate terms to express the different methods of payment? [Person2]:  No. These terms need to be amplified. [Person1]:  What if the sale is made on the basis of sight draft? [Person2]:  Then the shipping documents have to be attached. That way, both parties confirm the documents that will accompany the draft and constitute evidence of shipment in compliance with the contract terms. [Person1]:  Therefore, we must be very careful in building up clear expressions and complete understanding on both sides of trade. [Person2]:  Yes, that's very important.
[Person1]:  The company is going to recruit some people. [Person2]:  Really? Are there any vacant positions? [Person1]:  Yes. The position of senior secretary had fallen vacant. [Person2]:  What happened to Kitty? She was an excellent senior secretary. [Person1]:  She has just got married. And she wants to be a full-time housewife. So she left [Person2]:  What a pity! Do you have any idea who will be the new senior secretary? [Person1]:  Not yet. The company has advertised the position. [Person2]:  What qualifications are needed? [Person1]:  A female graduate from the secretary college with a good knowledge of English. [Person2]:  A graduate does not always make an qualified employee.
[Person1]:  Dad, can we go to that hotel next to the river again this year? [Person2]:  Your mother didn't like it. [Person1]:  What about the place on top of that hill? [Person2]:  That's full so Mum and I found one in the woods. I booked it last night.
[Person1]:  Hey, Charlie. How was your football game the other day? [Person2]:  Great! Our team played hard and out Huasheng Team. [Person1]:  Congratulations! But hold on, there. Taishan Team, you know, is difficult to play. [Person2]:  You're right. It will be a close game. But I've got a good feeling about this game. Our team is sure to win! [Person1]:  Don't be too sure. Remember, we don't know who will win before the last game. [Person2]:  Well, let's wait and see.
[Person1]:  hey, Mary, what's up?  [Person2]:  not much. Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight.  [Person1]:  oh, that's exciting. What's this guy like? Is he hot?  [Person2]:  well, I didn't think so at first. But as we started talking, I found his extremely funny and witty. I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes! We have so much in common. We like the same teams, music, a  [Person1]:  it seems you two are a good match. What qualities do you look for in a friend?  [Person2]:  there's nothing definite I think. I don't have a list or anything, but when I first meet somebody, I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend. It seems I have radar h  [Person1]:  well, that's something I've never heard of. But if you as me what I value most in a friend, I would have to say honesty.  [Person2]:  I agree. You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person. Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need.  [Person1]:  yeah, I know. A friend in need is a friend indeed. I don't need fair-weather friends either. 
[Person1]:  This is Word Master on Radio 4. Today we have Professor Danny Sheffield from Arkansa Community College. OK, Danny, could you tell us how to produce a good piece of writing in college? [Person2]:  Well, one of the basic things about any writing is to remember 3 key points. Number One, say what you're going to say. So you're telling the reader what you're going to write about and maybe also your opinion in the beginning part. The second thing is say it. And here's where you provide details and facts to support what you have stated. And the third part is say it again. Conclude the main parts of your article and restate the key points that you've made and what you want your readers to understand. [Person1]:  But what really separates an excellent article from the average ones? [Person2]:  I would say it's a personal voice, because people respond to such an article much more easily. So if you want to touch the readers' feelings, your natural voice will help. That puts your writing more into the excellent type rather than 'Oh, this is a good formal article'.
[Person1]:  Good evening, Do you have a reservation? [Person2]:  Yes. The reservation under Mr. Watson. [Person1]:  Ah, yes, a table for four at 8 [Person2]:  Em, no, thanks. I think we'll go straight to the table, By the way. may I check my overcoat here? [Person1]:  Certainly, sir. We'll keep it in the cloakroom for you. Here is your number. When you leave, show it to the waiter behind the counter, please. [Person2]:  Thank you. Could you show us to our table now? [Person1]:  Would you please follow me, please? [Person2]:  Thank you. [Person1]:  This is your table. It's Number 10.
[Person1]:  Hi, good morning, Miss? what can I help you with? [Person2]:  Good morning I'd like to mail this box of books to Taiwan. [Person1]:  OK, please put it on this scale.Airmail or by sea? [Person2]:  How long does it take to reach Taiwan by sea? [Person1]:  Usually about two month. [Person2]:  That's too long.How long does it take to reach Taiwan by airmail? [Person1]:  About ten days. [Person2]:  Then how much is that by airmail? [Person1]:  Let me see.It ' s 57 dollars, 20 cents, including tax. [Person2]:  That's a little bit expensive. [Person1]:  Although it's expensive to send it by airmail, it's quicker and safer than by sea. [Person2]:  I guess I have to send it by airmail. [Person1]:  Do you want to ensure the contents, Miss? [Person2]:  Yes, please. [Person1]:  Please fill out this form, also please write the value of the items in this space. [Person2]:  OK.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, sir, I'm afraid you can't park your car here. [Person2]:  Why not? It's my parking space. [Person1]:  I'm afraid not, sir. [Person2]:  Oh? That's a surprise. Let me see... D 0411 Our dog's birthday. Yes, I'm sure this my parking space! [Person1]:  But I saw a red car always parking here before. [Person2]:  Oh, we've just repainted our car. It was red. [Person1]:  Maybe. But the car of this space has a broken rearview mirror on the left. [Person2]:  Yeah. It used to. We got that fixed yesterday too. [Person1]:  Could you wait for a minute, sir? I'd like to have a check. [Person2]:  Sure, go ahead. [Person1]:  Sorry, sir, my mistake. This is your parking space. [Person2]:  That's all right. It's not your fault.
[Person1]:  Hi, Dan. What's new? [Person2]:  Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch with you for two days. [Person1]:  I went to Salt Lake City on business. What's up? [Person2]:  I got fired. [Person1]:  How come? Last time I saw you. You told me it was a good job, and you'd like to take it as a career. That was only one month ago. Why this sudden change? [Person2]:  It's a long story. In a word, I didn't do a good job of it. I messed up a business deal, a deal that would have made ten million dollars and I messed it up. [Person1]:  What are you going to do now? [Person2]:  I am trying to find a job asap. Lily doesn't know yet. I didn't tell her. I spent the past three days at the coffee shop next to your office, and she thought I went to work as usual. [Person1]:  That's not the way to solve the problem. Did you look in the classified advertisements column? [Person2]:  Yes, I did. But I wasn't qualified for most of the jobs that I was interested in. [Person1]:  Listen. I will see what I can do, ok? You go home and tell Lily about this problem you have now. She is your wife and I am sure she will understand. [Person2]:  I just don't know how to bring it up. Well, all right. She has the right to know anyways.
[Person1]:  hi, Bob, I am so glad that you came. [Person2]:  of course I'd come. I couldn't think of a better chance to see all my old friends. [Person1]:  yeah. It's hard to believe that it's been ten years since graduation. It feels just yesterday we collected our diplomas. [Person2]:  how time flies. But hey, how are things going with you? [Person1]:  oh, where to start? There have been ups and downs. I'm still trying to find my place in this world. It's only recently that I've been able to start settling down. How about you? You still with Jenn [Person2]:  yeah, Jenny and I got married right after graduation. It was tough the first years trying to make ends meet. I was supporting us both while she continued her studies. But now things are getting better [Person1]:  oh, that sounds wonderful. I have always known you two would make it. I hope I can keep in better contact with you guys. I don't want us to drift apart again. [Person2]:  definitely! Actually, we just moved into a new place. There's a house-warming party this Saturday, if you are free? I know Jenny would love to see you again and it should be a good party. [Person1]:  sounds great! I'll be there.
[Person1]:  How about the hiking? It was freezing yesterday, are you all ok? [Person2]:  Can't be better, it was wonderful. We had a lot of fun there. There was so much joy and walk and breathe the winter air. We arrived at the park at 9 o'clock in the morning and didn't leave till 3 o'clock in the afternoon. [Person1]:  You had been walking for 6 hours, isn't that boring? [Person2]:  Of course not! We built a snowman, some snow dogs and one big snow fort. We went sliding on the nice hill. It was a real work out. At noon, we had the most special winter picnic outside. Fortunately, we got it all on a video tape. You must come with us next time. I bet you will love it. [Person1]:  Well. You know I hate walking, but I can't wait to see your guys'video.
[Person1]:  My pal, you are so nervous recently. You don't need to be like that. [Person2]:  I am worried about that Arden will display all my drawbacks in the performance review. That will be embarrassing. [Person1]:  Just use your head. If you were definitely making some big mistakes, you would be informed. [Person2]:  I had a nightmare last night and I dreamt Arden told me that my performance fell short of his expectation. I was terrified to wake up after hearing that. [Person1]:  That is merely a dream. Remember, there is always room for us to have further improvement. I think we did the good job in the whole period. [Person2]:  I know what you are talking about. The performance evaluation process starts from the day we're hired. There is no surprise during the actual review.
[Person1]:  When are we leaving for our field trip? [Person2]:  Our science field trip is next Monday at 8 a. m. in the morning. Can you mark that on your calendar? [Person1]:  Yes, I will write that down. [Person2]:  That will be Monday, December 2nd. We need to start loading the buses half an hour early, so plan to arrive at 7. [Person1]:  Yes, I will be there on time. [Person2]:  We will return 6 days later on December 8th. Will someone be picking you up? [Person1]:  Yes, someone is coming to get me. [Person2]:  The return bus will leave the campground at 5 p. m. and return to campus 3 hours later at 8 p. m. [Person1]:  What should we bring with us? [Person2]:  I am going to post all of that information on the geology club web page. Check it out when you get a chance. See you Monday!
[Person1]:  Let's do something different today. [Person2]:  Like how? [Person1]:  I would like you to give me a different hair style. [Person2]:  What did you have in mind? [Person1]:  Give me a short haircut. [Person2]:  Do you know how short you want your hair to be? [Person1]:  I want you to cut it to a few inches long. [Person2]:  That's pretty short. Are you sure about this? [Person1]:  I've had this idea for some time now. [Person2]:  I'm going to do it, but you have to be sure you really want me to. [Person1]:  This is what I want. [Person2]:  Fine then. Let's get started.
[Person1]:  have you bought a present for jim's birthday yet? [Person2]:  no, I haven't. I can't think of anything to get him. [Person1]:  I'm having the same problem. I want to get something really special. Jim always seem to know exactly what to get people as gifts. [Person2]:  I know. He bought me that beautiful sweater for my birthday. It was exactly what I wanted. And it fit me perfectly! [Person1]:  he bought me an iron. [Person2]:  that doesn't sound like a great present. [Person1]:  maybe not, but my iron was getting old. In fact, it stopped working the week after jim bought me the new one. It's as if he knew that my old iron would soon stop working! [Person2]:  let's think. He loves football, doesn't he? I saw signed photographs of famous footballers in a shop near hear. Let's go and have a look. You know which team he supports, don't you? [Person1]:  yes, I do. Let's go. We should be able to find something suitable. We should get him something old. . . something historic. [Person2]:  it'll be an expensive present, but we can share the cost. [Person1]:  I'll be happy to get him something special, even if it coasts a little extra. [Person2]:  yes. He always get us special gift. We should repay his kindness.
[Person1]:  I hear that you've got a chance to go to Europe for a half-year training program. Is it true? [Person2]:  Yes, I'm leaving on the 14th of next month. [Person1]:  Congratulations! How can you get such a good opportunity to be trained overseas? [Person2]:  Actually, it is a policy in my company. The human resources management department has connections overseas this year, so we can receive training there. [Person1]:  How nice! But will you have to pay for the training? [Person2]:  No. The company pays for everything. Doesn't this sound very attractive? This is why our company can always get the best employees!
[Person1]:  Are you through with your meal? [Person2]:  Yes, we are. Could we have the check, please? [Person1]:  Here is your check, 86 dollars in all. Can I take care of it here when you are ready? [Person2]:  Do you accept checks? [Person1]:  No, I'm sorry we don't. We accept credit cards and cash. [Person2]:  Well, I don't have any cash with me, so I'll have to put it on credit. [Person1]:  I'll be right back. [Person2]:  Ok, please wait a minute. Can I have my food packaged? [Person1]:  I see. I'll bring some to-go boxes for you. [Person2]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, sir. I've made a tough decision and here is my resignation. [Person2]:  I am sorry to hear that. Why do you want to quit? [Person1]:  I'm sorry to bring up my resignation at this moment, but I've decided to study abroad. [Person2]:  All right. Welcome back anytime. [Person1]:  Thank you, sir. I'd like to say that I'Ve really enjoyed working with you. However, I think it's about time for me to leave. [Person2]:  I am glad to work with you, too. Good luck! [Person1]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  Well, it was nice talking to you. [Person2]:  It was nice talking to you too. [Person1]:  We should really hang out again. [Person2]:  That would be fun. [Person1]:  Where do you want to go? [Person2]:  I think we should go out to eat. [Person1]:  That sounds good. [Person2]:  All right, so I'll see you then. [Person1]:  I'll call you later. [Person2]:  Okay, I'll talk to you later then. [Person1]:  See you later. [Person2]:  Bye.
[Person1]:  I called about that ad we saw in the paper. [Person2]:  For the construction site manager? [Person1]:  That's the one. [Person2]:  What happened? [Person1]:  You were right. It was from a headhunter. She wouldn't tell me anything without a contract. [Person2]:  Well, no surprise there. [Person1]:  No! Not at all. But, I did find out they have more than one position with different clients, so at least one would probably work. [Person2]:  Great, so are you going to sign a contract with them? [Person1]:  I'm going there tomorrow. [Person2]:  Great. Good luck.
[Person1]:  What can I do for you, sir? [Person2]:  I'm looking for a jacket for my son. [Person1]:  Come with me, please. Here are the jackets for boys. [Person2]:  The black one looks nice. How much is it? [Person1]:  Twenty-five dollars. [Person2]:  Oh, I am afraid it's too expensive. [Person1]:  What about the blue one over there? It looks nice, too. And it's a little cheaper. [Person2]:  But it's a bit too small. Have you got a bigger size? [Person1]:  Sorry, we haven't. But we'll get some soon. Will you come back next week? [Person2]:  All right. I'll come back then. Thanks.
[Person1]:  Congratulations, Betty. [Person2]:  Thank you. What about Peter? [Person1]:  Oh, he dropped the stick. [Person2]:  Bad luck! Do you know who won the high jump? [Person1]:  Joe from our class. [Person2]:  Your class do very well at the sports meeting. By the way, what sport are you taking part in? [Person1]:  Swimming. [Person2]:  Good luck to you. [Person1]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  Do you get along with your boss?  [Person2]:  Actually I do. She is really understanding and reasonable most of the time. There was only one time I didn't really agree with her.  [Person1]:  When was that? ?  [Person2]:  Once she fired one of my co-workers for drinking on the job. I felt bad for him, because it is so hard to find a job thses days, and he has a family to support.  [Person1]:  Well, he shouldn't have been drinking on duty. It's your boss' responsibility to make sure employees are safe, and also doing their jobs.  [Person2]:  You are right. She was being a good boss when she fired him, but I just felt sorry for him, that's all.  [Person1]:  Did this incident with your co-worker affect your relationship with your boss?  [Person2]:  Not really. All of us at the office respect our boss a lot.  [Person1]:  You're lucky you can get along so well with your boss. It makes a big difference in how much you enjoy your job.  [Person2]:  No kidding. If you don't like your biss or your co-workers, they can make your life miserable. 
[Person1]:  You know, Mary, I feel we meet somewhere before. Where were you born?  [Person2]:  I was born in Beijing, but I spent most of my childhood in London.  [Person1]:  What was your childhood like?  [Person2]:  I had a pretty strict upbringing, and my parents taught at universities so they have extremely high expectations for me.  [Person1]:  Where did you go to university?  [Person2]:  My parents wanted me to stay in Beijing, but I decided to go back to England. I graduated from University of Newcastle upon Tyne with a degree in Cross Culture Communication.  [Person1]:  What is your current occupation?  [Person2]:  I am a journalist. I write for China Daily.  [Person1]:  Did you know that you wanted to be a journalist right after your graduation?  [Person2]:  No, I didn't. I started working at a university in London but as time went by, I found I did not really like my job. I decided to explore other fields. Journalism is great fit for me as well as a challenge.  [Person1]:  Do you like your current job?  [Person2]:  Yes, I came to Beijing two years ago looking for new opportunities. I was lucky because my friend introduced me to my current company. 
[Person1]:  Have you started your report yet?  [Person2]:  I'm having a hard time getting the information.  [Person1]:  It's easy. You only have to search the internet in order to get the information you're looking for.  [Person2]:  Oh, I didn't think of that. 
[Person1]:  Good morning, I'm Daniel. I'm applying for the positon of manager.  [Person2]:  Yes. Sit down, please. How did you learn about our company?  [Person1]:  I got to know your company through such famous brands as LUX, LIPTON and WALLS. After making a customer survey, I was glad to find out how your products are appreciated by millions of Chinese.  [Person2]:  Why would you like to work with us?  [Person1]:  It's the job I'm interested in. And your company is the best-known. Although I don't have much experience as a manager, the job description you sent to me was very interesting. It's a job I've been dreaming of and I feel suited to fill it.  [Person2]:  Oh, really? Would you transfer to another company if it is not what you expected?  [Person1]:  I don't think so. As the saying goes, 'A great oak needs deep roots. ' I'm really interested in this job.  [Person2]:  That's fine. Thanks for coming to see us. I hope to be able to let you know about the job within the week. 
[Person1]:  Barbara, could you cover for me for a few hours? [Person2]:  I guess so, Sam. I could tell the boss you've gone to buy some office supplies if she asks. [Person1]:  Thanks, I owe you one. [Person2]:  Hey, not so fast, Mister. I need to know where you're going. Why do you need to be gone for that long? [Person1]:  I forgot to get my dad something for Father's Day. [Person2]:  Oh, man! You forgot your own dad's birthday? [Person1]:  No, it's not his birthday. It's Father's Day! [Person2]:  Since you're going, would you mind picking up something for my dad too? [Person1]:  Oh, well, I guess I don't really know your dad though. Do I? [Person2]:  Couldn't you just buy a couple of ties in the shop downstairs? That would be easy enough, and that way you could come back before Mrs. Greenway checks on us. [Person1]:  OK, good idea. I'll be back in 30 minutes then.
[Person1]:  I'll have to make a choice soon about next year. I've been offered a job to work in America. But I've also passed the public servant exam to work in the government of my hometown. [Person2]:  Wow! America? How could you say no? [Person1]:  Well, believe it or not I don't have a burning desire to see the world. I'd much prefer just to stay at home. Anyway it's hard to decide. [Person2]:  Well, I would strongly advise you to think of the future. Working abroad, as much more exciting than working in a small town. You're lucky to have a choice. A lot of people don't.
[Person1]:  Hi Wendy, I'm going to Isabel's. Are you coming? [Person2]:  No, the things there are too expensive for me. I can't afford them. [Person1]:  Don't worry. Isabel's is having a clearance sale and today is the last day. [Person2]:  Really? That's wonderful. Can you wait a second? I need to change. [Person1]:  Alright, but hurry up. [Person2]:  Should we ask Cindy to come along? She saw an evening dress made of silk there last month, which she liked very much. [Person1]:  She is already bought that evening dress. [Person2]:  When? [Person1]:  Yesterday. She wore that dress last night and showed off to everybody at Mr. Mile's Party. [Person2]:  Oh, that isn't like her. [Person1]:  Hurry up, will you? We'll have to go to a gas station first. We'd better be there before lunch. [Person2]:  Alright, alright. I'm ready now. Let's go.
[Person1]:  I have a cell phone in my car. Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side. Why don't you get it for me, and then I can call the police? [Person2]:  Alright. [Person1]:  It doesn't work. It looks like it's broken. I need to get to a hospital. You should drive me there. [Person2]:  Oh, yeah? It's better if we make a police report first. Then you can go to the hospital. [Person1]:  Damn it! I'm injured here. We could wait all day for the police. [Person2]:  Well, you'll just have to wait. I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive. I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone. Don't worry. You'll get to the hospital in time. [Person1]:  It really hurts. [Person2]:  Yes, maybe it does. But if you're going to drive like you did just now, you will have to get used to a little physical pain. You know what I mean? [Person1]:  To hell with you. The accident was your fault. [Person2]:  I'm afraid it wasn't. And when the police get here, you will also see that it wasn't. But enough of this bickering. I'm going to go find a phone. Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone. Alright? [Person1]:  To hell with you.
[Person1]:  It was really hard for our parents to save money when they were young. [Person2]:  Most people were living form hand to mouth. How could they? [Person1]:  Yeah. They simply had no extra money to save up or for other things. [Person2]:  Fortunately, things are changing these years.
[Person1]:  What's the plot of your new movie? [Person2]:  It's a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders. I play the part of the detective. He has to catch the killer, but there's very little evidence. It's a psychological th [Person1]:  Did you enjoy making the movie? We heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director. [Person2]:  I have had disagreement with every director. I'Ve worked with. We'Ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences. It was the same when I made this movie. I don't no [Person1]:  Critics are not very happy with the movies that you'Ve made recently. Does that bother you? [Person2]:  Not at all. The feedback from audience has been great. I care about what they think more than what the critics think. [Person1]:  Did you do you own stunts in the movie? [Person2]:  I wanted to, but my insurance company wouldn't let me. All of my stunts were done by a stuntman. As you know, I used to do my own stunts, but I'll leave that to the experts in future. [Person1]:  Thank you very much for doing this interview. [Person2]:  My pleasure. Have you seen the movie yet? [Person1]:  Yes. I have. I liked it very much. Like you, I was very impressed with Rachel's performance in the movie. She's going to be a star.
[Person1]:  Good morning, sir. Are you Mr. Wang, the personnel manager? [Person2]:  Good morning. Yes, I am. But I'm sorry I don't think I know you. [Person1]:  No, you don't. My name is Liu Lili. I got the information from the TV that your department wants to hire a clerk, who will work under you. I would like to apply for the job. [Person2]:  Oh, yes. We do have such a commercial. Sit down, please, Miss Liu. I'm glad to see you. Could you tell me about yourself first? [Person1]:  OK. I'm 24 this year. I earned my college diploma from the Night College of Foreign Languages Institute in 2010. My major is English. Recently I'Ve also earned my degree in Secretarial Technology. [Person2]:  Could you tell me about your work experience? [Person1]:  Of course. I'Ve been working as an office clerk in the Textile Company since my graduation. I do a lot of things, such as typing, handling the daily correspondence, arranging meetings and so on. [Person2]:  Do you enjoy your work? [Person1]:  To be frank, not very much, because I can't use much what I'Ve learned in my work. I enjoy doing more challenging work. [Person2]:  Well, according to your experience, perhaps you could tell me what essential qualities a personnel department office clerk should maintain. [Person1]:  Of course. First of all, she must have a strong sense of responsibility. [Person2]:  Good. Go on, please. [Person1]:  She must be an honest person. [Person2]:  Anything else? [Person1]:  She must also be diligent and do a lot of things on her own initiative. [Person2]:  Good. The work includes keeping the files. Have you got any practical experience with that? [Person1]:  Well, no. But I took related courses. I can gain experience quickly. I'm sure I can do the job well.
[Person1]:  Professor Wang looks so handsome today. He is wearing a light brown suit and a pink tie. [Person2]:  He always wears an extremely becoming suit with tie. [Person1]:  He's quite particular about what he wears, especially about his ties. He gets different tie each day. [Person2]:  A light brown suit and a pink tie today, and a light blue shirt and a blue tie yesterday. A perfect match! [Person1]:  The tie is necessary for man. It makes you look so attractive in a super tie. [Person2]:  Match is important ; well, the way of tying is also important. [Person1]:  My father dose not know how to tie a tie, for he often wears a cravat. [Person2]:  My father wears a tie every day, but he can't do it himself. My mother helps him with his tie every morning. [Person1]:  You mother is not only a patient mother but also a gentle wife.
[Person1]:  How do you think people get their personalities? [Person2]:  I think it's mainly from the environment a person lives in. [Person1]:  Don't you think people get their personalities from their parents? [Person2]:  No, but parents control a lot of the environment that kids grow up in, so they certainly influence their kids'personalities a lot. [Person1]:  So why do you think many kids have personalities that are so different from their parents. [Person2]:  Maybe when they become teenagers, they want to be completely different to their parents. [Person1]:  You might be right. I guess most parents want their kids to be like them, but kids today grow up in a different environment. You know, they know much more about the world from the internet, newspapers, and tv. [Person2]:  Do you think that teenagers get a lot of their bad behaviour from tv and movies? [Person1]:  Maybe some of it. I think a lot of people blame TV and movies when the real problem is that the parents aren't bringing their child up correctly. [Person2]:  Parents have a difficult job. They have to bring up their children and usually have to work too. [Person1]:  Yes, that's true. Your son is doing well at school, isn't he? [Person2]:  Yes, he is. He's very hardworking when he's at school. Then he comes home from school and does homework before dinner. After dinner, he goes out with his friends. [Person1]:  So, he's not a bookworm? It's good that he has an outgoing personality. Some kids are very quiet and introverted. You wonder they'll survive in the real world without their parents to support them.
[Person1]:  What is the most unexpected thing you experienced in space? [Person2]:  I wasn't quite prepared for the view of the Earth as we left. It was just awe-inspiring. It emerged from just a slightly curved horizon to a whole Earth, where you could look across oceans and continents in a single glance. I wasn't quite prepared for that. It's inevitably etched in my memory. [Person1]:  When viewing the Earth from space, do you feel detached from humanity or more a part of the totality of humankind? [Person2]:  Detached. You're literally detached from one planet, captured by another. Your only link to reality is the Earth out there ; fortunate - 1y, it stays in view the whole time. [Person1]:  There're a lot of suspicions that the International Space Station is never going to become reality. Is it going to be some future project that never happens? [Person2]:  I believe it's certainly for real. It without question has suffered a lot of delays. But there's hardware sitting on the pad right now and it's due to go off in December. It is a reality. It has just taken longer to get literally off the ground. [Person1]:  There were a lot of talks during the Bush administration about a not too distant future Mars mission. It seemed to fizzle out. Do you think that this Shuttle mission will reignite the public's passion for space and get us to Mars sooner? [Person2]:  I hope this flight is not just a one-time affair, that it does re-ignite people's interest to push on. But only time will tell. [Person1]:  You had gone to the moon twice, orbited space around the Earth lots of times, and of course you have had the most amazing views that a human being can have. How long do we ordinary beings have to wait to feel the weightlessness? I just can't wait. [Person2]:  If I were the man making the decisions, you could get in line tomorrow. I strongly support ordinary people going into space. Unfortunately, I don't think it will be in the near future.
[Person1]:  Look at this. This magazine has some guidelines for having a healthy diet. [Person2]:  When you have finished it, I'd like to see that. I've been thinking about what I am eating recently. I want to get some more ideas about nutrition and good health. [Person1]:  I've noticed that you aren't eating much junk food and are avoiding food with too much fat. I know this diet is healthy, but... [Person2]:  What are you thinking? Isn't this diet very tasty or satisfying? [Person1]:  No, I don't think it's tasty but I know it is important to have healthy food to keep fit. [Person2]:  Following the principles of good nutrition will help us to be healthy and enjoy a better life. [Person1]:  But sometimes I'd like to enjoy a piece of rich cheesecake. [Person2]:  Having one serving of cheesecake once in a while is not a problem. We just can't have too much and too often.
[Person1]:  Ok, I'Ve got an up-to-day map. Let's check the route from here to the airport. [Person2]:  Where are we? Oh, here we are. So we drive to the A120 and turn left. [Person1]:  No, we turn right. Remember that we are coming from this direction. [Person2]:  Oh yes! Sorry! Then we drive to the M11 motorway. [Person1]:  How far is that? [Person2]:  It's only seven miles. We turn left to join the motorway and drive south. [Person1]:  According to the map, we get off the M11 at the second junction and join the M25. That's the motorway that goes around the edge of London. [Person2]:  That's another 15 miles, so that's 22 miles total so far. [Person1]:  Then we drive west on the M25. we must be careful to turn in the right direction! [Person2]:  Then we drive on the M25. it turns south. When we reach exit 15, we turn left and go west along the M4. [Person1]:  Then we take the first Heathrow Airport. What's the total distance? [Person2]:  The journey around the M25 is 33 miles and then 3 extra miles to get to the airport. So how many miles is that together? [Person1]:  22 miles to the M25, 33 miles on the M25, and 3 after that. That's a total of 58 miles, isn't it? [Person2]:  It shouldn't take us very long to cover that distance. Remember that we can go quite fast on the motor way. [Person1]:  We can only go fast on the motor ways if there isn't much traffic. I think we should allow ourselves plenty of time to get there. Being early is much better than being late.
[Person1]:  Are you ready to go shopping? [Person2]:  Just a few minutes. I need to make a list of the things that we need. [Person1]:  Good idea. Have you written down tea, eggs and potatoes? [Person2]:  I forgot about the potatoes. Oh, I almost forget that we need a microwave oven badly. What kind of tea do you prefer? Green tea or flower tea? [Person1]:  Let's just get both. Do you bring enough money? [Person2]:  We don't have enough cash, but I'll take my credit card.
[Person1]:  Decent dressing and appearance, which contribute to a good first impression of the interviewer, are surely quite important. [Person2]:  Of course. Generally speaking, dressing should be tidy and neat, and match well with your identity, age, and experience. [Person1]:  Whatever you wear, it should perfectly reflect your confidence and vitality [Person2]:  Professional suits may be the best choice. [Person1]:  Gentlemen should wear western-style suits in the interview, which will help you look handsome. [Person2]:  Ladies should wear professional suits, either classical style or free style. It would be appropriate to wear a little or no make-up. [Person1]:  But those fashionable and shiny clothes should be avoided. [Person2]:  Name brand is not necessary. Anything decent will be fine. [Person1]:  You should present the best of yourself in order to achieve success in the interview. [Person2]:  Only when you dressing keep in accordance with that of other people around can you feel harmonious and relaxed. [Person1]:  In a word, dressing and appearance are indeed important, but it should never be all. [Person2]:  In other words, too much emphasis on it is undoubtedly to neglect the essentials.
[Person1]:  Hi, Mason! [Person1]:  Oh, hi, Phoebe! [Person2]:  Hey, in class today I heard you have a big family. [Person1]:  That's right. I've got five brothers and six sisters. [Person2]:  Wow! That's pretty big! Are you the eldest or the youngest? [Person1]:  Neither. I'm the third eldest.
[Person1]:  OK, I just want to brief you all on the travel market in Taiwan. To start with, generally speaking, the travel industry in Taiwan focuses mainly on tours. This segment of the industry is well developed. [Person2]:  Sorry to interrupt, Doris, but can you tell me more about these tour groups, what kind of things they enjoy, and so on? [Person1]:  Yes, of course. Most of the time, when they travel, they prefer to do so in large groups accompanied by a guide, who usually takes care of everything, for instance, choosing the restaurants, the itinerary, the mode of transport, and things like that. Another thing is that most travelers to the UK tend to be middle aged, around 40 to 50 or so. This age group is less adventurous ; they like good hotels, and have money to spend. They kind of prefer to stay in the cities where they feel safer. They are not into mountain climbing in Wales or anything. [Person2]:  I don't mean to interrupt, but can you tell me what plans you have for growing the youth market? [Person1]:  Just a moment. I'll tell you about that in a minute. Where was I? Oh yes. By way of illustration, let's look at the top five destinations in the UK for this kind of traveler over the last five years. If you look at page ten you can see what I mean. In spite of these characteristics of the market, I still think there is room for growth in the youth sector. [Person2]:  So how do you intend to do that? [Person1]:  OK, let me tell you what we'Ve been doing. We'Ve been in touch with the Wales and Scottish Tourist development offices here in Taiwan and they're interested in working with us to promote their regions to the youth segment. We'Ve decided to implement an advertising campaign focusing on the excitement of the activities in those regions. [Person2]:  May I interrupt you for a moment? [Person1]:  Go ahead. [Person2]:  How much is it going to cost, and who is going to pay? [Person1]:  Well, at the moment we are trying to work out those details. We haven't managed to come up with a concrete plan yet, but we are working on it. [Person2]:  I see. OK. So what's next? [Person1]:  Well, our intention is to have some features about these regions in some youth magazines. We're also going to run some ads on TV and put some flyers in places where young people go, like the gym and student organizations. We're making arrangements to have some activities at big shopping malls and department stores around town.
[Person1]:  Alright, tell me what you think about this one. [Person2]:  Don't you think it's a bit bright? [Person1]:  Yeah, maybe you're right. How about this outfit? [Person2]:  That dress looks lovely on you, but it's not very practical, is it? [Person1]:  No, I don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon, but I love the way it looks. I just want to try it on! What do you think about this? It's casual, yet sophisticated. [Person2]:  I like the jeans, but you need something to go with the top. It's too plain on its own. [Person1]:  How about this scarf, these earrings, and an anklet? [Person2]:  That might be going overboard a bit. How about just that scarf with a bracelet? [Person1]:  That's a good idea. You have a lot of good fashion sense. [Person2]:  Thanks. You'd be OK on your own. There are loads of fashion victims out there, and you are not one of them. Have you tried it on yet? [Person1]:  Yep. Here it is. What do you think? [Person2]:  That looks great. Just one more thing-you need some high heels with those jeans. Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them? [Person1]:  The leopard print sounds fabulous. OK, I'll take it.
[Person1]:  How would you introduce volleyball? [Person2]:  I was once a high school man teacher and basketball coach. I never played volleyball before and I've seen it just once in my life. One day my school needed a lot of coaches for our girls' team. I was one of the youngest teachers on stuff and the girls talked me helping coach volleyball. The girls they have were great and they began to start. A friend of mine was a volleyball player. He taught me beginning and then taught me how to coach it. [Person1]:  What sports did you play in high school? [Person2]:  I played basketball, tennis and golf. I was not a volleyball player at all. I was pretty good at basketball. But then my real passion was gone. I played it every day. [Person1]:  When did you know you want to be a full-time volleyball coach? [Person2]:  It wouldn't take very long. I've been coaching women's basketball that I really love it. But when I saw an opportunity in women's volleyball, because coaches were needed. In this way, I become a college coach immediately. I like coaching women's volleyball at college very much because it seems to fit my personality.
[Person1]:  Forgive the mess in here, we had a party last night. There were a lot of people and they all brought food. [Person2]:  Yeah, I can tell. Well, I guess it's pretty obvious what you'll be doing most of today.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, could you tell me where the post office is? [Person2]:  Go straight on, turn right at the first traffic lights. The post office is about fifty meters away. [Person1]:  I see. And is the No. 13 Middle School far away from the post office? [Person2]:  Not far. It's about 150 meters. Where do you want to go? [Person1]:  Oh, I only want to pick up my cousin from school. I am told that the school is next to the post office, and that is why I want to know how to get to the post office first.
[Person1]:  Where is that?  [Person2]:  Take me to the airport, please.  [Person1]:  Are you in a hurry?  [Person2]:  I have to be there before 1700.  [Person1]:  We'll make it except a jam. You know it's rush hour.  [Person2]:  There's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time.  [Person1]:  I'll do my best.  [Person2]:  Here's twenty dollars.  [Person1]:  Do you have small bills?  [Person2]:  No. If you can't break it , keep the change. But can you give me a receipt?  [Person1]:  Here is your receipt. Thank you. 
[Person1]:  Can I help you, madam?  [Person2]:  Yes, I'm looking for a new winter coat.  [Person1]:  Have you any particular color in mind?  [Person2]:  I don't know really. What's the fashional color this year?  [Person1]:  Red is very popular.  [Person2]:  Good. Red suits me very well. It's a cheerful color, isn't it?  [Person1]:  Yes, madam, I agree. What size are you?  [Person2]:  Well, I used to be size fourteen, but I've put on a bit of weight recently, so may be sixteen.  [Person1]:  Here you are, madam. All these are sixteens.  [Person2]:  I quite like this one. How much is it?  [Person1]:  It's $180.  [Person2]:  Oh, that's too expensive. Aren't there any cheaper ones?  [Person1]:  These are our cheapest coats, madam.  [Person2]:  Yes, I see. I'll take it. Here's $200.  [Person1]:  Here's your change.  [Person2]:  Thank you. 
[Person1]:  Have you run into your cousin Jimmy lately?  [Person2]:  As a matter of fact,I have. I ran into him just the other day.  [Person1]:  How's he doing?  [Person2]:  Not too well. He had to have four teeth pulled last week.  [Person1]:  He did?That's too bad!  [Person2]:  I think so,too.  [Person1]:  Next time you see him,please tell him I'm thinking of him.  [Person2]:  I'll be sure to do that. 
[Person1]:  What will you be having this evening? [Person2]:  I think I'll start with some soup, and then I'll have the steak. [Person1]:  And how would you like your steak cooked, sir? [Person2]:  Medium rare, please. Also I'd like the vegetables instead of the salad. [Person1]:  Sure. And what will you be having to drink? [Person2]:  I think I'll have a glass of your red wine with some ice water as well. [Person1]:  Coming right up, sir.
[Person1]:  OK, I've got an up-to-date map. Let's check the route from here to the airport. [Person2]:  OK. Here we are. So we drive to the A120 and turn left. [Person1]:  No, we turn right. Remember that we are coming from this direction. [Person2]:  Oh yes. Sorry. We need to drive only 7 miles to the M11 Motor Way and then we turn left to join the motorway and drive south. [Person1]:  According to the map, we get off the M11 at the second intersection and joined the M25. That's the motor way that goes around the edge of London. [Person2]:  That's another 15 miles so that's 22 miles in total so far. [Person1]:  Then we drive west on the M25. [Person2]:  Then we continue driving on the M25 when it turns south. When we reach exit 15, we turn left and drive along the M4. Then we take the first exit for Heathrow Airport. What's the total distance? [Person1]:  The journey along the M25 is 33 miles and then it's 3 extra miles from there to get to the airport.
[Person1]:  Welcome to Wanda International Cinema. Can I help you? [Person2]:  Umm... I want to know when 'Operation Red Sea' is showing today. [Person1]:  There are 6 showings today, one in the morning, another at noon, and then 3 p.m., 6 p.m., 9 p. m., and a midnight showing. [Person2]:  OK, I want 5 tickets for the 9 p.m. showing tonight. Are there still 5 tickets available that are seated together? [Person1]:  I'm sorry, there are only 3 tickets left. How about the 6 p.m. showing? There are still 7 tickets left for that show. [Person2]:  But we have a date for dinner at 5 p.m., so we won't make the beginning of the movie. [Person1]:  So would you like to see another movie? 'Detective China Town 2' is very popular, too. [Person2]:  No, we all want to see this one. Is there any way that we could buy tickets now for Friday's screens? [Person1]:  You can order tickets right now for the next three days. It's Wednesday today. So, that's OK. What time would you like? [Person2]:  The 9 p.m. showing. I think there might be more people who want to see the movie on Friday.

[Person1]:  I'll do that, Mr.Zhang, See you tomorrow. [Person2]:  See you!
[Person1]:  Look, here is a very special business card from an illustrator. Every time I go through my book of business cards, I will notice it. It is an eye-catching one. [Person2]:  Wow, fantastic. I like the font and color for his name. It is creative yet personal. [Person1]:  Yes, it is a bold design. People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card. It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations. [Person2]:  I agree. Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business. It won ' t take much time to design an amazing card, but it can make a big difference among the crowd. And you ' ll always notice it from your collection. For they have outspoken colors, own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card. I wish to have one like this. But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow.
[Person1]:  How do you feel about that restaurant? [Person2]:  It wasn't all that great. [Person1]:  What did you dislike the most? [Person2]:  I don't think that they had their act together. They didn't seem well prepared. [Person1]:  Did you think that the food was any good? [Person2]:  I wasn't all that impressed by the food. [Person1]:  The service certainly could have been better. [Person2]:  The service did not help the situation. [Person1]:  Is this a restaurant that you want to come back to? [Person2]:  I am not interested in trying this restaurant again.

[Person1]:  Hi, David! Mr. Harper has just asked me if you'd finished your project yet. It was supposed to be handed in yesterday. [Person2]:  I know. I'm just finishing it now. [Person1]:  He wanted to know if we'd done them together. I said no. What's yours on? It took me ages to do mine. [Person2]:  Well, I was really lucky. I found this book all about the population in New Zealand cities. [Person1]:  Is it good? [Person2]:  Yes, it's a great book! I photocopied three chapters. There are some brilliant charts and... [Person1]:  What are you going to do with all that? [Person2]:  Well, now I'm going to copy these pages and these charts and then I'll finish my project! [Person1]:  You're not supposed to just copy the book. [Person2]:  Oh! I think Mr. Harper won't know. [Person1]:  He will know! He asked us to write a list of all the books we'd used. Remember? That's not the point anyway. [Person2]:  What is the point then? [Person1]:  Well, the point is that you're supposed to write your own project--you can't copy someone else's writing. [Person2]:  Er... er... Well, you're right. Thank you for your reminding me of that.
[Person1]:  Professor Li, do you know where to buy art supplies? [Person2]:  For what? Are you taking up painting? [Person1]:  No. I can't paint. I'm asking for my niece. She is really into it. [Person2]:  Oh, good. How old is your niece? [Person1]:  She is eight. Actually, I'm buying a good set of art supplies for her as a birthday gift. [Person2]:  It's a wise thing to do. Art will do a child a world of good.
[Person1]:  Does your wife work? [Person2]:  Yes, she does. She works at home. [Person1]:  Oh, I understand. She cooks, cleans and takes care of children. Is that right? [Person2]:  Oh, no. Most of the time I do these things. She is a writer. [Person1]:  You are really a hen-pecked husband.

[Person1]:  Look at this, A Brief Introduction of Hollywood. [Person2]:  Hackneyed theme! [Person1]:  What? How much do you know Hollywood? [Person2]:  Nearly everything. [Person1]:  You are full of boasts. I can examine you by question and answer. What is Hollywood? Where is it? What is the function of it? [Person2]:  Too easy questions. Listen carefully. Hollywood is the movie capital of the world. It is located in southern California. Many films have been made there, and the kinds have changed often. [Person1]:  Not bad. What kind of film did it produce from the ready to mid 1930's [Person2]:  Gangster movies. Movie-goers at that time could get a look at the people involved in crime and their violent activities by watching it. [Person1]:  Mm. What came after that? [Person2]:  After all that violence, people needed to laugh, so from the mid-to-late l940's, many detective movies about policemen who solved crimes were made. Then came musicals. [Person1]:  Pretty good. Please continue. [Person2]:  Right. By the mid - 50's, this light-hearted genre was competing with films about more serious subjects. There was one kind that could be found throughout all of these years, and that was the, mm, the. . . [Person1]:  The western films about America's cowboys, Indians and early settlers. [Person2]:  Come on. [Person1]:  Since the early 1960's, there are horror movies about people who encounter frightening, unnatural situations, and serious films such as documentarist about events that actually happened, and science fiction movies about possible friture and future worlds. Some people have also enjoyed watching psycho-dramas about the everyday problems that people have. [Person2]:  Any more? [Person1]:  Of course, no list of film would be complete without animated movies. These are especially popular among children.
[Person1]:  Today on mind matters, I'm talking to Dr. Ann Winters, an expert on human memory.. Ann, welcome to the program. Now, I suppose the first question everyone would ask is [Person2]:  Well, like so many easy questions, the answer isn't very simple. Basically, human memory is a compartment in people's brains where they store images rather like the hard disc drive in a computer. And like a hard disc drive, our memories can become infected or even wiped out by accidents. But the comparison breaks down when we consider that we can train our memories to expand and work better which computers can't manage yet. [Person1]:  When you talk about memory being infected, do you mean by a disease? [Person2]:  Yes. For instance, people suffering from a physiological disease like Alzheimer [Person1]:  And how can someone exercise his brain? By thinking a lot? [Person2]:  In a way, yes. But you can also practice using your memory which not only exercises your brain but also improves you ability to remember things. Unfortunately, a lot of devices in modern life are designed to make sure we don't forget things which can make our brains more idle and weaken our memories. [Person1]:  Can you give us some examples of how to exercise our memories? [Person2]:  Sure, there is a very simple technique, although it works better for some people than for others. When you want to remember something, think of a physical thing it reminds you of. If I want to remember a date from history, let's say, 1066, the date of the Battle of Hastings. I might think that battle reminds me of bottle, so I think of a bottle with the number 1066 written on the label. And I just picture that bottle to myself.
[Person1]:  Hi, Paulo. How are things going? [Person2]:  Everything's going very well. The first phase of the project was finished three days ahead of schedule. We're on target to complete phase two by the beginning of week 40. [Person1]:  That's good news. What stage are you at now? [Person2]:  Well, we've just finished laying the cabling and we're waiting for the safety inspector to give us the go-ahead to continue. I'm just going to meet him. Do you want to come?
[Person1]:  I'm really happy that you came to visit me. [Person2]:  I really missed you a lot. [Person1]:  I've been missing you like crazy. [Person2]:  I don't understand why you haven't come to visit me. [Person1]:  Lately, I've been quite busy. [Person2]:  Tell me what you've been up to. [Person1]:  I've really been working a lot lately. [Person2]:  I've been pretty busy myself. [Person1]:  So what have you been up to? [Person2]:  I've just been working a lot. [Person1]:  Whatever the reason may be, I'm glad you visited me. [Person2]:  I'm glad I did too.
[Person1]:  Excuse me. Who is the person responsible for handling complaints here? I would like to make a few complaints. [Person2]:  I am the manager here. You can complain to me. How may I help you? [Person1]:  Here is the thing. I was woke up by strange noises of the telephone several times last night. Even I unplugged it, it wouldn't stop beeping. I am also not satisfied with the housekeeping service in my room. So I want to change to a cleaner and quieter room. [Person2]:  I apologize for everything disturbing you. We will give another room to you right now. Please wait a moment.
[Person1]:  Ace Employment Agency. Good morning. [Person2]:  Good morning. I wonder if you can help me. I'm looking for a job. [Person1]:  I'll see what we can do. Uh...Have you been to us before? [Person2]:  No. But you've managed to get jobs for some of my friends. So I thought, perhaps, you know... [Person1]:  Yes, I see. First of all, could you give me your full name?

[Person2]:  No. I left full-time education when I was 18. [Person1]:  I see. Any qualifications? [Person2]:  Yes. I gained a shorthand and typing diploma at evening classes. [Person1]:  That's good. Now, where are you working at the moment? [Person2]:  Well, I've got a job as a shorthand-typist. But I'm not enjoying it very much and it doesn't pay very well. [Person1]:  I see. Have you applied for any other jobs? [Person2]:  Yes. I thought I'd like to be a policewoman. But they turned me down because I Was too short. [Person1]:  what would you like to do now. then? [Person2]:  Well, I think I'd like to work in a travel agency. [Person1]:  I see. I think the best thing for me is to see what we might find for you. And then...
[Person1]:  [A knock at the door.] Come in, please. [Person2]:  Hello, Kate. Where's Jane? I want her to type this letter for me. [Person1]:  I'm afraid she can't, Tom. She isn't working today.

[Person1]:  No, not very. Anyway, it's worth the money.
[Person1]:  You have been here for how long? Four months now?  [Person2]:  Yeah, about.  [Person1]:  Do you know Chinese better now?  [Person2]:  Oh, definitely. I remember, when I first arrived in Guangzhou, my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone.  [Person1]:  Oh, yeah. Many Chinese like to bargain. It happens almost everywhere.  [Person2]:  I mean, I understand that. But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster, until it seemed to me that they would fight. My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match. The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation.  [Person1]:  A shouting match? You're so funny. You must be exaggerating. I don't believe it.  [Person2]:  I am not exaggerating at all. I'm telling you the truth. That was how I felt at that time.  [Person1]:  Yes, perhaps. Chinese usually don't notice that sort of thing. Maybe it's quite natural to us.  [Person2]:  Yes, absolutely true. 
[Person1]:  This is the good life! We have it good don't you think?  [Person2]:  Yeah of course! Although, don't you ever wonder what 'could have been'?  [Person1]:  What do you mean?  [Person2]:  Well, sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things a little differently.  [Person1]:  For example?  [Person2]:  Like for example, if I hadn't studied architecture, I would have become an artist like I wanted to.  [Person1]:  I see. Yeah now that I think of it, I wouldn't have gotten married if I hadn't moved to this town and met Sally.  [Person2]:  You see! Everything happens for a reason! We wouldn't even have met if I hadn't been in that car accident ten years ago!  [Person1]:  Well, I have no regrets!  [Person2]:  I'll drink to that! 
[Person1]:  Where did you go yesterday?  [Person2]:  I went to play tennis in the public park.  [Person1]:  How often do you play tennis?  [Person2]:  Twice a week. How about you?  [Person1]:  I seldom play tennis. I prefer football and basketball.  [Person2]:  But it is very difficult to gather a team of players together.  [Person1]:  I usually play with my schoolmates.  [Person2]:  Do you like watching football matches?  [Person1]:  Yes, I went to the Tian He Sports Center for a football match last Sunday.  [Person2]:  Oh, I watched it on television. It was an exciting match. 
[Person1]:  I hear scientists in the US have discovered a new AIDS vaccine.  [Person2]:  Does it work?  [Person1]:  I don't know. The report says it is better than the old vaccines.  [Person2]:  Don't count on it. I think the best way to prevent AIDS is to keep yourself clean by having clean sex and keeping a regular sex partner.  [Person1]:  Right. That's why doctor say AIDS prevention means cleanness. 
[Person1]:  Hey there Chris, what are you up to? [Person2]:  I'm just poring over some brochures about various car models. [Person1]:  Oh, so you're thinking about buying a new car? [Person2]:  Yeah, it looks that way. My wife has been bugging me about it. I thought we could probably survive without one, but with a baby on the way, maybe it is time to get a car. [Person1]:  So this would be your first automobile? [Person2]:  That's right. For quite a few years, I rode a bicycle to work. Then I got a motorbike. [Person1]:  Yeah, I think I can understand your wife's position. Asking her to ride on a motorcycle when she's pregnant is a tall order. [Person2]:  Oh... I don't let her ride with me. It's just too dangerous. She takes the bus to work, but it is sometimes difficult to get a seat and it's crowded and hot. [Person1]:  So it's time to buy your very first car! Wow, that's exciting! [Person2]:  Yes, but it's also a pretty big financial responsibility. [Person1]:  Yeah. I still remember my first car. It was an old clunker that my dad gave me when I turned 17. I drove it around for a couple of years until I scraped together enough money to buy a better secondhand car. [Person2]:  I'm having a hard time deciding which model is best for us. [Person1]:  Yeah, it is a tough call. Each one has its pros and cons. Are you looking for a sedan? [Person2]:  Yes, I'd like a Jeep, but my wife says we have to get a comfortable sedan for long drives home to see her relatives. [Person1]:  I'd advise you to listen to your wife. She will be sitting in the back taking care of the kids so whatever she prefers is probably the best choice.
[Person1]:  What was your wedding ceremony like, Abigail? [Person2]:  My husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses. But then we had three parties to celebrate. [Person1]:  Three parties? That's quite a lot. That must have been expensive! [Person2]:  Well, since my husband and I are from two different countries, and we live in a third country, we decided to have one in each country. It wasn't actually that expensive. [Person1]:  Were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married? [Person2]:  I would have liked them to be there, but they couldn ' t afford to fly out to see us, and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them, so they understood. [Person1]:  Did your husband's family get to meet your family? [Person2]:  My husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown, so that was great. Some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions, but we agreed that it was just a waste of money, and we should save it and spend it on something else. [Person1]:  That makes sense. Did you go on a honeymoon? [Person2]:  We waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to Africa. [Person1]:  You really didn't have a very traditional wedding, did you? [Person2]:  Not at all, but we don ' t have a very traditional marriage either, so it suited us perfectly!
[Person1]:  May I help you? [Person2]:  Is this the right counter for gloves? [Person1]:  Yes, madam. What sort of gloves do you want? [Person2]:  Well, let me see some of each. [Person1]:  Certainly. What size do you take? [Person2]:  Six and a quarter, I believe, but you'd better measure my hand to make sure. [Person1]:  I think a six is your size. How do you like these? I can recommend them, they're very reliable. [Person2]:  Very well, I'll take these two.
[Person1]:  Mr. Wang, we haven't discussed the mode of payment. [Person2]:  You know Mr. Forster, this is a really large purchase. I am afraid we can't pay off at one time. We have to pay by installment. [Person1]:  Do you mean you prefer a deferred payment? [Person2]:  Yes, Mr. Forester. [Person1]:  When do you start the payment then? [Person2]:  We'll start our payment in half a year and the total amount will be paid off within 2 years by three installments. [Person1]:  We can accept that but you have to pay the interest. [Person2]:  All right. [Person1]:  Shall we sign the agreement now? [Person2]:  Ok, let's sign it.
[Person1]:  Have you read all these crazy things that are going on around the world? [Person2]:  What do you mean? [Person1]:  I was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed! Then they are sold on the black market. [Person2]:  Don't tell me you actually believe all that? Don't be so gullible, they are just urban legends. They are just stories people make up to scare you. [Person1]:  Well, I was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages if you play them backwards! Can you believe that? [Person2]:  You really think an artist or song writer is going to go through the trouble of putting subliminal or satanic messages in a song? Don't be so naive! [Person1]:  Well maybe you are right, but how about the story of how KFC has rows of headless chickens which are super grown in order to get bigger chickens faster! [Person2]:  Sounds a bit too far fetched to be true, don't you think?
[Person1]:  I'm very grateful for what you have done to my son, doctor. [Person2]:  That's all tight, Mr. Smith. That's my job. I'm very glad he recovered so soon. [Person1]:  I know he has brought great trouble to you. A million thanks. [Person2]:  No trouble at all. He's very cute and brave. By the way, do remember to keep him away from sea food for at least two weeks. [Person1]:  I will. It's most thoughtful of you.
[Person1]:  David, imagine meeting you here! [Person2]:  Janice, I found you stole my vegetables at four o'clock this morning. Is that true? [Person1]:  All right! I stayed up yesterday and waited for your vegetables. I stole your peaches and flowers. [Person2]:  It is so hard to prevent them from being stolen. I also got something this morning. [Person1]:  How many vegetables do you steal today? [Person2]:  I stole many from Fred's farm, and from yours. I planned to have a dog on farm. [Person1]:  So funny. By stealing, I forgot all my sorrows and pressure from work. [Person2]:  I could not agree with you more. For us, there are so many unhappy things and I am so bored ; however, I got lots of fun from stealing. [Person1]:  I really want to be far away from the reality now. [Person2]:  But we still need to go back to it. Don't overdo it.
[Person1]:  I've been learning to play go recently. It's an amazing game! [Person2]:  Weigh? It must be a greatest Chinese invention. I've tried hard to learn it. Its rules can't be any simpler, but I've never won a game of Go. Well, it's all Greek to me! [Person1]:  At least you have obtained a very basic understanding of the game, haven't you? I think it is perfect for boosting intelligence, cultivating personality and flexible learning. Every intellectual wishing to gain any insight into Chinese culture should learn to play Go. [Person2]:  I heard it is included in the four major arts of China, is it? [Person1]:  Sure. It was considered desirable that a well-educated ancient Chinese scholar could be well versed in zither, weigh, calligraphy and painting. I think weigh is the most fantastic of them. It embodies ancient Chinese wisdom and cultural profoundness. [Person2]:  I know it is quite different from Western chess. [Person1]:  Yes. Playing chess is a very aggressive experience. All the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents. Whenever I start a chess game, I can't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all fighters stand ready to kill. [Person2]:  But isn't it the same with wiki? [Person1]:  Certainly not. The object of weigh is to surround a larger area than the opponent. In other words, each side is struggling for a greater living space by mapping out a territory on the board. Hence, chess aims to kill, while weigh is most concerned with howso survive.
[Person1]:  You haven't spent much time with Sophia lately. Are you speaking to each other at the moment?  [Person2]:  No, we're not. We've been drifting apart for a while.  [Person1]:  But you two used to do everything together. I thought you really enjoyed each other's company.  [Person2]:  We did, but since she started her new job, all she does is hang out with her new friends from work.  [Person1]:  Can't you hang out with them, too?  [Person2]:  I could, but all they ever talk about is work, so I always end up feeling left out.  [Person1]:  Maybe you should invite her over for dinner, so it's just the two of you.  [Person2]:  I tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her! She's so busy these days that it's just impossible to hang out with her.  [Person1]:  It can't be that bad. She was always a really good friend to you.  [Person2]:  You're right. She would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge. But she just doesn't seem very interested in our friendship anymore.  [Person1]:  She's probably just excited about her new job. You should give her some time. It would be a shame to lose such a good friend.  [Person2]:  I've given her enough time. I'm over it now.  [Person1]:  I still think you two should try to patch things up.  [Person2]:  I think I just have to accept the fact that it's time for us to go our separate ways. 
[Person1]:  Hi, can I help you? [Person2]:  Yes, please. I'm looking for a sofa. [Person1]:  What about this one? [Person2]:  May it be used as a sofa in the day and a bed during the night? [Person1]:  Oh, you want a convertible sofa. This way, please. Over there is the one you want.
[Person1]:  I need somebody to come over and fix my internet. [Person2]:  What's wrong with it? [Person1]:  For some reason it's just not connecting. [Person2]:  How long have you been having this problem? [Person1]:  It hasn't been working the past few days. [Person2]:  Does the internet come up at all? [Person1]:  It does, but it won't connect to anything. [Person2]:  Well, the internet isn't down, so there must be something wrong with your connection. [Person1]:  Could you send someone to fix it today? [Person2]:  I'll send somebody over right away to fix it. [Person1]:  When will they be here? [Person2]:  They should be there in the next hour.
[Person1]:  Bob, can I talk to you for a minute? There have been some developments for the Stewart case that I really need to talk to you about. [Person2]:  Yeah, what's the matter now? We've had so much trouble with this case already. Don't tell me there's more bad news. [Person1]:  Well, I'm afraid there is. I have some bad news for you about the results of the forensic tests. . . there won't be any results. [Person2]:  What? What does that mean? Why won't there be any results? [Person1]:  I hate to tell you this, but it seems that every shred of evidence that would help us to convict were destroyed in a laboratory fire. There's nothing left. I'm so sorry. . . [Person2]:  Oh, no, you can't be serious. I never expect anything like this would happened. What are we going to do? [Person1]:  There's nothing that can be done. Everything is gone. I wish I could tell you differently, but what has happened has happened. We will just have to figure out a way to move on.
[Person1]:  My wife's birthday is today. I need some flowers.  [Person2]:  We have lots of fresh red roses.  [Person1]:  How much do the roses cost?  [Person2]:  $20 a dozen.  [Person1]:  That sounds good. Last year I paid $30.  [Person2]:  Yes, you came here on the right day. They're on sale today.  [Person1]:  Give me a dozen.  [Person2]:  Very good. Would you like anything else?  [Person1]:  No, I'll just give her the roses and a card.  [Person2]:  She should be very pleased with these roses. 
[Person1]:  Okay, now I'd like to find out more about your last job. I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly, is that right? [Person2]:  Yes, that's right. To be honest, the first year was quite tough for me. I was really just treated more like an intern. I didn't have many responsibilities and I found it quite frustrating. [Person1]:  So, what changed? [Person2]:  Well slowly but surely I proved myself, and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer. [Person1]:  Wow, a real step up! [Person2]:  Yes, I was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly. I spent restaurant years in that position, but to be honest it wasn't an area of journalism I wanted to stay in long-term. [Person1]:  I see, so why did you decide to leave finally? [Person2]:  I just felt that the paper couldn't offer me any new opportunities. I really needed a more challenging role to be honest.
[Person1]:  Hi. Hi Sweetie. I'm home. Um, I'm home! [Person2]:  Oh, hi honey. Welcome home. How was you day? [Person1]:  Well ... [Person2]:  That's good. [Person1]:  It was terrible. The company is going to lay off about 50 people, and I might be one of them. [Person2]:  Oh, that's nice. [Person1]:  That's nice? You're not even listening. [Person2]:  What? [Person1]:  So, what did I tell you? [Person2]:  Um, you said that the company ... something about 60 employees, um ... and you might be one of them ... or something like that. [Person1]:  No, that's not what I said. [Person2]:  Oh? [Person1]:  The problem is you never listen. Never! So look. I bought you this book. Here. Read it. [Person2]:  What? Now what? Big Egos, Little Ears [Person1]:  No. YOU did. I used YOUR credit card. [Person2]:  Oh, whatever. Um, so, what great secrets does the book contain that I don't know already? [Person1]:  Okay. First of all .... [Person2]:  Okay. I know, I know. I know what you're going to say. [Person1]:  No, you DON'T know. The first thing is not to interrupt and think you know what I'm going to say. Hold your tongue for once and give me a chance to share my feelings before you come up with some witty response. [Person2]:  Okay. I got it ... I think. [Person1]:  I hope. Number two. Show me that you're listening. Stop checking Facebook while I'm talking to you, turn off the TV, look me in the eyes. Anything to show me that you're paying attention. [Person2]:  Right. Uh, so what's for dinner? [Person1]:  See ... see! [Person2]:  Hahah. I'm sorry. I'm just joking. [Person1]:  It's not funny. It's not funny!! So QUIT LAUGHING!! And don't tell me what to do to fix my problems either. Most of the time, I don't need solutions. I just need you to listen to my feelings. [Person2]:  Okay. I guess I haven't listened enough. [Person1]:  No. You don't listen very much. [Person2]:  And I haven't shown much empathy. I am sorry. [Person1]:  No. [Person2]:  And, well, I should have been better. How about if I read a couple of chapters and then we talk about it? Is that okay? [Person1]:  Yeah. That would be nice. Thank you.
[Person1]:  Dr. Smith, you were a political journalist in America and I was told that you've chosen to live here, a mountain village like this in the Himalayan Community. Could you please tell me why you came to India and settled down here? [Person2]:  Yes, of course. I came to India a year ago to have a better understanding of the country. After I arrived, I had to find a place where I could live and write. Of course there were many places for me to choose. But after some months I settled down happily in this village because I like the countryside better and it is a little cooler than those in the plains. [Person1]:  Have you ever thought of a typical village as a better choice? [Person2]:  Yes, I have. Yet no such thing exists. In fact I wasted a lot of time looking for the typical village. Conditions vary too widely. But the villages I stayed in had much in common- poverty, dirt, and ignorance. [Person1]:  But in spite of all this, you still feel very happy. Is the experience in this country so important to you that you came all the way from the United States? [Person2]:  Well, that's also the question that the villagers ask me. They think that I'm crazy to give up my comfortable life in the United States and isolate myself from the outside world in this remote village, like a retired old man Why have I come? I've put aside my work as a political journalist because my ideas have changed. I've come to believe that what is happening in the Third World is more important than anything else. But to understand how three-quarters of the world's people live, and how their future might affect the rest of the world, I feel that I first have to try and share their way of life. [Person1]:  I must say I find your view on this issue very convincing. I'm sure when you go back to your own country you'll find your stay here very rewarding.
[Person1]:  Have you heard about Anlesen David?  [Person2]:  No, have they have another fight?  [Person1]:  No, they got engageed.  [Person2]:  You must be joking. Those two.  [Person1]:  Well, my dear. I didn't believe either. But got it straight form the horse's mouth. Davi called me this morning.  [Person2]:  So when did this happen?  [Person1]:  Last weekend , while they were on the sik trip.  [Person2]:  Well, I believe it now, and when are they are getting marry?  [Person1]:  Next june.  [Person2]:  I can hardly believe it. 
[Person1]:  What are you doing here, Tom? [Person2]:  I am organizing my fishing equipment. [Person1]:  What for? [Person2]:  I'm going fishing with my best friend. [Person1]:  So you really like fishing huh? [Person2]:  Yeah, I do. [Person1]:  When did you first become interested in fishing? [Person2]:  Long ago. You know my father really likes fishing. When I was a child, he took my brother and me to the riverside to go fishing. It was around that time that I started to get into it. [Person1]:  Oh, I see.
[Person1]:  Hi, could we have two orange juice smoothies? [Person2]:  Would you like those with yogurt? [Person1]:  Sure, why not? [Person2]:  What else would you like to add? We highly recommend caterpillar fungus. [Person1]:  Caterpillar fungus?! What the heck is that? [Person2]:  It ' s a special kind of Chinese herb. It ' s good for you!
[Person1]:  Would you like some tea or coffee? [Person2]:  No, thank you. It's very late now. I won't be able to sleep well if I drink some tea or coffee. [Person1]:  Then what about some water? [Person2]:  Yes, please. [Person1]:  Don't work too late since you are not in good health. You should be careful with your health. [Person2]:  I know, but I have to finish these reports tonight. Our manager will use them at the meeting tomorrow morning. [Person1]:  Can I help you with something? [Person2]:  No, I'm afraid you can't. Just turn down the TV set a little so that it won't be so noisy. [Person1]:  I will. I do hope that you will finish the report soon and get some sleep. [Person2]:  Don't worry. It won't take me too long.
[Person1]:  It's a beautiful day here in New Zealand at the Men's Volleyball world championship. My name is Rick Fields and I'm joined by the man with the plan, Bob Copeland. [Person2]:  Thank you, Rick. We'Ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams, Brazil and China, face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round. Without a doubt, both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match. [Person1]:  The ref signals the start of the game and here we go. Ribero serves and China quickly receives the ball. Chen bumps it to the setter, and. . . a very nice set by Chen! [Person2]:  Xu spikes it! Wow, what a great hit! The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in! [Person1]:  It's China's service now. What a superb jump serve by Li, oh, and we have a let serve. The ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net. [Person2]:  Brazil calls for a time out and we'll be right back, after a short commercial break.
[Person1]:  I want to try something different today. [Person2]:  What do you mean? [Person1]:  I want a different hair style. [Person2]:  What style do you want? [Person1]:  Can you make my hair short? [Person2]:  Exactly how short do you want it? [Person1]:  Make it a few inches long. [Person2]:  Are you sure you want me to cut it that short? [Person1]:  I've been thinking about this for a while now. [Person2]:  Okay. I'll do it if you're positive that this is what you want. [Person1]:  I honestly want my hair that short. [Person2]:  All right, then let's begin.
[Person1]:  Julie, what's on the tube? [Person2]:  nothing but bench of commercials. These days the amount of commercials is amazing. [Person1]:  yeah. Maybe we can change to another channel. what about the sports channel? Let's see if there's a game on. [Person2]:  okay. Nope, it's a replay of yesterday's soccer match between Brazil and Spain. [Person1]:  it was a good game, but not good enough to watch again. Keep surfing. [Person2]:  alright. Hmm, this movie is a rerun. . . I don't know how many times I've seen this show. . . Commercial again. . . and a replay of the talk show. . . oh no, this show is terrible, you don't wanna watch it. [Person1]:  oh, what is it? [Person2]:  it's a total rip-off of an American reality show, but the imitation is unbearably clumsy. [Person1]:  oh, I know this kind of shows. Sometimes they really piss me off. If I wanted reality, I'd go outside. [Person2]:  yeah. . . it seems what we have on TV now are either repeats, or commercials, or low-quality shows. There's really nothing to watch. [Person1]:  I don't get it. We have more than 100 channels and there's still nothing good on! Maybe we should just turn off the TV, get outside, and do something real. [Person2]:  cool.
[Person1]:  Has my package arrived? [Person2]:  I'm not sure. What does it look like? [Person1]:  It's quite a delicate piece of equipment, so I hope it was well-packed. It's oblong-shaped, about 50 cm long. It's made of metal. [Person2]:  There's a large wooden crate in the corner which I haven't unpacked yet. It might be in there.
[Person1]:  Verry sorry to have kept you waiting so long. What do you want, Madam? [Person2]:  I want haircut and perm. [Person1]:  How long would you like your haircut today? [Person2]:  Just cut a little off. [Person1]:  You wanna tight, medium or naturally curly perm? [Person2]:  I'd like to have medium. [Person1]:  How about you hair style? [Person2]:  Can you tell me my choices? [Person1]:  Well, with perm we can do very kinds patterns such as bob, chocolate hairstyle or bang. Which do you prefer? [Person2]:  I want the chocolate one. I want to have it the big waves. [Person1]:  It looks wonderful. [Person2]:  Turn the chair I can see myself in the mirror. [Person1]:  What do you think of it? [Person2]:  Beautifully done, many thanks.
[Person1]:  Hey, Gary, great to see you again. Please have a seat. So tell me, what seems to be the problem? [Person2]:  Thanks, doc. I'Ve got a really bad toothache! I can't eat anything, and look, my face is all swollen. I think it might be my wisdom tooth. [Person1]:  Well, let's have a look. Open wide. Hmm. . . this doesn't look good. Well, it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose. We'll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse, and the crown probably needs to be refitted. I'm going to order some x-rays. [Person2]:  Is it gonna hurt? [Person1]:  No, not at all! Just lay back and relax.
[Person1]:  What position have you held before? [Person2]:  I have been a salesman. [Person1]:  Would you tell me the general description of your present job? [Person2]:  I am in charge of the trading department. [Person1]:  What made you decide to change your job? [Person2]:  I'm working in a small company where further promotion is impossible. [Person1]:  Why do you leave your present company? [Person2]:  I never easily give up something that is valuable. Before I decided to quit that position, I had made a thorough analysis of things like what I would gain and what I would lose here in your company. You know, Shanghai is always a fascinating place to me, full of challenges as well as hopes. In addition to this, I have the specialized knowledge and the necessary experience of making a good. Of course, opportunities to work abroad and a higher salary are also important to me. So I believe it's worthwhile to come here to work. [Person1]:  Why did you pick this organization? [Person2]:  I'm very much interested in the position. [Person1]:  What made you decide to join our company? [Person2]:  I believe I would have better opportunities with a small but rapidly expanding company like yours.
[Person1]:  Now, Mr. Sun, did you see the accident clearly? [Person2]:  Oh, yes. I was standing outside the post office. [Person1]:  Can you remember what time it happened? [Person2]:  Yes, it was 4 [Person1]:  Good. Now, was the truck going fast? [Person2]:  Yes. Well, perhaps the driver thought the traffic lights were going to change to green. But they were red. [Person1]:  Are you sure, Mr. Sun? [Person2]:  Yes, absolutely sure. [Person1]:  Well, thanks a lot, Mr. Sun. Good-bye. [Person2]:  Good-bye.
[Person1]:  Good morning, can I help you?  [Person2]:  No, thanks. We are just looking around.  [Person1]:  Take your time. Please let me know if you need any help.  [Person2]:  OK, thanks. We will.  [Person3]:  Oh, Gucci, the clothes here are expensive! No wonder there are only a few people in here.  [Person2]:  Beauty costs, friend. Oh, look at this pink skirt, how cute!  [Person3]:  Believe it or not, they look cute, but not very practical.  [Person2]:  Come on, May, don't talk like my Mom.  [Person3]:  When you buy clothes, you must consider the material, quality and price.  [Person2]:  But fashion changes!  [Person3]:  Make sure the clothes can be worn for various occasions.  [Person2]:  All right, May. Hey, look, I'm sure this is the same skirt that Spice Girl wear.  [Person3]:  Definitely! Oh, I love Spice Girls! I gotta get this skirt! 
[Person1]:  What did you say when Alice told you the news? [Person2]:  I calmed up and hesitated indeed. And finally, I asked her to chew the cud for such an important decision. I could not have the heart to disappoint her with a blunt refusal. But I put my foot down and insisted on her forgetting that. [Person1]:  How could you have the heart to do that? She needs warmth and help.
[Person1]:  Hello, I'm Sylvia from Mexico. [Person2]:  Have you ever worked as a babysitter? [Person1]:  Yes, actually when I was in year 11, almost everyday after school my cousin would leave her little daughter with me. [Person2]:  Did you enjoy the time with her? [Person1]:  Yes, sure. She was 2 years old and she just learned to walk. It was quite exhausting, but I like her so much and I enjoyed every minute of it. [Person2]:  That's amazing. Can you start working Friday night? [Person1]:  Oh, sorry. I'm not available this Friday. Maybe Saturday? [Person2]:  OK, sounds fine to me.
[Person1]:  Welcome to Fergusons. Can I tell you about our specials today? [Person2]:  I'm not a regular customer here so could you recommend something for lunch? [Person1]:  Well, this afternoon our special is the club sandwich, but I really like the French onion soup. Are you ready to make a selection or shall I give you more time? [Person2]:  I think that I'll take your recommendation on the French onion soup. Could you please bring me some ice water first? [Person1]:  OK.
[Person1]:  Where would you like to go on holiday? [Person2]:  Well, I have no idea about that. [Person1]:  I would like an active holiday this year. Maybe I'll visit Ayers Rock. [Person2]:  I've been quite tired from doing so much work. Climbing the rock will use even more energy. [Person1]:  What would you like to do then? [Person2]:  Well, I just want to relax. I'm going to have dinner with my parents and then watch my favorite TV show. [Person1]:  Do you think you can do that for a whole week? [Person2]:  Oh, my sister Kate told me there will be a movie festival. They're showing many old and new movies this week. We've decided to go to the movies together.
[Person1]:  I'm looking for a string of pearls for my wife. [Person2]:  Yes, sir. What price range do you have in mind? [Person1]:  I'm not sure. I don't know very much about the price of pearls. [Person2]:  I see. Let me show you some samples of various qualities. This one is very nice. It's three hundred and fifty dollars. [Person1]:  Is there a price reduction? [Person2]:  We are having a sale now. The price has already gone down. [Person1]:  How much is that one? [Person2]:  It's two hundred and eighty dollars. [Person1]:  OK. I'll take it. Thank you.
[Person1]:  I do want to meet with you and take a look at your catalogue. We ' re redecorating and are going to add some things. [Person2]:  Well, I ' ll be glad to help you out. I can come out anytime on Tuesday or Thursday of next week. [Person1]:  Let ' s put it down for 1 [Person2]:  Fine. I ' ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogues on Thursday.
[Person1]:  Hi, welcome to Hal's Computer World. Can I help you with anything? [Person2]:  Yes, I'd like to buy a new computer, but I don't really know much about them. Can you give me any suggestions? [Person1]:  No problem. First of all, do you want to get a home computer or a laptop? [Person2]:  Laptops are more expensive, right? [Person1]:  Yes, they generally cost a little more. [Person2]:  I'll just get a regular home computer then. I don't think I'll need to lug my computer around with me.
[Person1]:  Did you see the letter I got from Bradford Films? They sent it in response to your phone call last week. [Person2]:  If they wanted to say something about my call last week, why didn't they sand it to me? [Person1]:  I guess they must not have your contact information, so they sent it addressed in care of your department head. Anyhow, they wrote to confirm in writing what you discussed about the Milton contract. [Person2]:  Can I see it for a second? [Person1]:  Sure, here it is. . . [Person2]:  Dear Mr. Clark, Further to our telephone call last Friday, I am writing to confirm our meeting on july 21. As we discusses, our meeting is to review the contract details. [Person1]:  Did they ask you to send the files beforehand? [Person2]:  Let's see, ' we would e grateful if you could please send related materials to our office prior to our meeting. ' It looks like. . . hey, was there anything else sent along with this letter? [Person1]:  I don't think so, why do you ask? [Person2]:  The letter reads, ' please find enclosed a copy of our agenda for your review. ' I don't see anything else in the envelope. . . [Person1]:  Maybe they forgot to attach it to the letter. You should give them another call.
[Person1]:  Brian and Christina were mentioning that maybe it would be fun to go on vacation together this year, John. [Person2]:  I thought that I already told you that I am going with Mark to Alaska. [Person1]:  Are you kidding me? [Person2]:  You know what? You and I had no plans, so I made plans with Mark. What's the problem? [Person1]:  We have been together for a year and usually, people who've been together a year, take their vacation together. [Person2]:  I don't think that I ever heard of that rule before. Any more rules that you would like to tell me about? [Person1]:  Go on your vacation with Mark and when you come back, why don't you just move in with him as well! [Person2]:  I am really looking forward to getting away from you. Far away from you!
[Person1]:  What a lovely day. The sun is shinning and the sky is so blue. It's a perfect day to go to the beach and get a beautiful tan. [Person2]:  Great idea. Unlike you, I just want to enjoy watching the sea and playing with the sand. I do not want to get a tan because I look good in pale skin. [Person1]:  Come on. Getting a tan symbolizes health and wealth in western countries. [Person2]:  While the pale color symbolizes beauty and elegance in most Asia countries. [Person1]:  That is a really interesting fact. [Person2]:  I will bring a big hat and apply a lot of sunscreen before setting off the beach. [Person1]:  Just do whatever you feel like doing. [Person2]:  ( At the beach ) My bag is so heavy. Let's put the stuff under the tree. [Person1]:  Good idea. It is always cooler in a shade. [Person2]:  I can't wait to play in the water. My feet are burning when I stand on the sand.
[Person1]:  I've sent out the invitations for the dinner party. [Person2]:  That's good. Now what should we do? [Person1]:  We need to plan the menu. [Person2]:  Oh, that's right. What do you have in mind? [Person1]:  I think I'm going to make the chicken salad we had at our 39th wedding anniversary. Remember, I asked Thomson, the chef of the restaurant where we often go, for the recipe? [Person2]:  Oh, yes. I remember. Time sure flies! Now we are celebrating our golden anniversary! And Thomson was very friendly. You know, chefs seldom tell people their recipes. They often keep them a secret. [Person1]:  I understand that. So you see, I have promised I will also keep the recipe a secret. [Person2]:  Well, Thomson will appreciate that. Oh, but did you forget that Linda doesn't eat chicken? [Person1]:  Linda? Oh, my Gosh! I forgot to invite her! She'll be mad at me. It just slipped my mind. Thanks for reminding me! I think I'm getting old! [Person2]:  Looks like you are!
[Person1]:  Oh, Christina, is that you? How have you been? [Person2]:  I've been okay. I've just been busy with school. We really should get together and have a chat. How about joining me for dinner tonight? [Person1]:  I'd love to, but I'm leaving for Miami at 8 tonight because my brother is getting married on Saturday morning. [Person2]:  Congratulations! I hope that you have a nice time there. [Person1]:  Well, what are you doing now? Maybe we can go to the coffee shop and chat for a while. [Person2]:  I really wish I could, but I'm on my way to the tennis courts. [Person1]:  Tennis courts? I didn't know you could play tennis. [Person2]:  I'm taking tennis lessons. My roommate is on a tennis team and she's gotten me interested in the sport. Do you know how to play? [Person1]:  A little, but I haven't played for years. When I come back from my trip, I'll join you in taking lessons. [Person2]:  It's a deal. Just give me a call when you get back. [Person1]:  You got it.
[Person1]:  Do you have anything to do after this? [Person2]:  No, I don't. [Person1]:  Shall we drop in somewhere for a couple of drinks? [Person2]:  That sounds like a good idea. [Person1]:  I know a very interesting place. [Person2]:  Oh, do you? Good.
[Person1]:  School is finally out. Do you have any plans this summer, Kate? [Person2]:  Yes. In August, I'm going on a two week vacation to the Bahamas. [Person1]:  Awesome! How much is that going to cost you? [Person2]:  Don't ask. I have to work every single day this month, just to be able to pay for the vacation. [Person1]:  I know what you mean. I've been saving up to buy a truck. I want to have one for the start of my last year of college. [Person2]:  That would be nice. [Person1]:  Well, it's too bad you won't be around in August. There's a famous English soccer team coming to town. [Person2]:  I heard. At least I'll be able to see the Backstreet Boys in July. It's my favorite band. They're playing at the Victoria Theater. [Person1]:  I've been there. I saw the Jim Jefferies comedy show there once. [Person2]:  You saw that? How did you get tickets? I heard they were hard to get. [Person1]:  My friend works at the ticket office. Do you want me to see if he can get you tickets as well? [Person2]:  No need. I won mine on a radio show. I had to answer 3 questions about the band and I got them all correct. [Person1]:  A true fan. You deserve to go.
[Person1]:  Are you ready to order? May I suggest a veal? [Person2]:  No, I'll have the fish please. [Person1]:  The chicken is also nice. [Person2]:  No, I want the fish. [Person1]:  Our special tonight is lobster. [Person2]:  Thank you, but I prefer the fish. [Person1]:  Perhaps you'd enjoy the lamb. [Person2]:  No, I like the fish. [Person1]:  What ever you say?
[Person1]:  What can I do for you, Madam? [Person2]:  Can you help me with Comprehensive Credit Granting? [Person1]:  Certainly, Madam. What would you like to know? [Person2]:  Well, everything really. [Person1]:  All right. We can grant a Financing Promise Quota, if you qualify. This means that we can deal with all of your needs in a speedy and efficient way. Firstly, your Credit Rating must be class A, and your Debt to Asset Ratio must be top notch, for the industry you are involved in.
[Person1]:  Joe, can you squeeze me in sometime today? [Person2]:  That's a big order, Jane. I am really swamped. [Person1]:  I know what you're saying, but I have to go over the books with you before I go see our tax guy. [Person2]:  Right. Okay, let me see what I can do. How about 1
[Person1]:  Mom, this is your third bowl of rice! [Person2]:  I know but I have no choice. My stomach just keeps crying for more and more. [Person1]:  Why? I never saw you eat so much before. [Person2]:  I've been going to the gym these days. The exercise makes me hungry all the time. [Person1]:  So your stomach is the one that actually gets a lot of work-out. [Person2]:  Don't pull my leg. [Person1]:  This way you'll probably put on more weight. Will you give up? [Person2]:  Surely not. I can feel the results. I'm starting to feel different now. [Person1]:  Then how are you gonna deal with the problem of getting extra weight? [Person2]:  I'm planning to meet my personal trainer to have the work-out plan fixed. [Person1]:  Oh, I've got an idea. Why don't you ask Dad to go with you? He badly needs some exercise. [Person2]:  Your father is a bit too timid. He even doesn't know how to introduce himself. [Person1]:  He can just say, I'm Benjamin. I'm new and shy. [Person2]:  Girl, don't make fun of your Daddy. But I can introduce him to my personal trainer. Maybe one day he will be a fitness freak instead of a cough potato. [Person1]:  Who knows!
[Person1]:  Hello. Could I speak to Justin, please? [Person2]:  Speaking. [Person1]:  Oh, hi Justin. This is Karen Hepburn. We met at Chris and Jim's party. [Person2]:  Of course. How're you? [Person1]:  Great. Uh, Justin, would you like to see Otis Lesley on Thursday night? He's at the Kangaroo Club. [Person2]:  I'm sorry, Karen, but I can't. I have to work late this Thursday. [Person1]:  Oh. . . that's too bad. [Person2]:  Yeah. I really like Lesley. [Person1]:  Actually, are you doing anything on Friday or Saturday? He's playing those two nights as well. [Person2]:  Well, I can't make it on Friday either, but I'm free on Saturday night. What time does it start? [Person1]:  At eight sharp. How about meeting in front of the club at about a quarter after seven? [Person2]:  That sounds perfect. And let's go out for coffee after the show. [Person1]:  Sure! [Person2]:  See you at seven fifteen, Saturday.
[Person1]:  Pretty! Say beautiful rather. Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than she altogether-face and figure? [Person2]:  I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers. [Person1]:  Such an eye! The true hazel eye-and so brilliant! Regular features, open countenance, with a complexion, Oh! What a bloom of full health, and such a pretty height and size ; such a firm and upright figure! There is health, not merely in her bloom, but in her air, her head, her glance. One hears sometimes of a child being'the picture of health'; now, she always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up health. She is loveliness itself.
[Person1]:  Excuse me. What time does the next bus for Boston leave? [Person2]:  It leaves at 8 [Person1]:  I see. Are there any seats available? [Person2]:  Just a moment, please. Yes, you can have a seat. [Person1]:  Good. How much is a one-way ticket? [Person2]:  It's 38 dollars. [Person1]:  All right. Here's 40 dollars. [Person2]:  Here's your ticket and change. [Person1]:  Thank you. Which gate should I go to for the bus? [Person2]:  Go to gate number 2, please. [Person1]:  Thank you very much. [Person2]:  Don't mention it.
[Person1]:  Here is my ticket and seat assignment. [Person2]:  Thank you. That way, PLS. [Person1]:  May I have a pillow and blanket, PLS? [Person2]:  An attendant will pass them around after we take off. [Person1]:  May I have headphones for the in-flight movie? [Person2]:  No problem. Here are your headphones. Do you want something to drink? [Person1]:  Thanks, a coke, PLS.
[Person1]:  How have you been doing? [Person2]:  I can't sleep or eat. I have a really bad pain in my tooth! [Person1]:  How long have you had this toothache? [Person2]:  It bothers me off and on, but it's gotten much worse these past few weeks. [Person1]:  Is there anything that you'Ve done to your tooth that might have caused the pain? [Person2]:  My girlfriend told me that I grind my teeth a lot when I sleep. Maybe that is the problem. [Person1]:  When you brush your teeth, what do you use? [Person2]:  I use a soft bristle toothbrush. [Person1]:  Does it bother you when you have to chew a lot? [Person2]:  Absolutely. That set it off big time!
[Person1]:  Professor wang can I ask a few questions? [Person2]:  Certainly. [Person1]:  What is the tariff? [Person2]:  It's a tax levy by the goveroverment on goods imported into that country. [Person1]:  Why does the government levy the tariff? [Person2]:  Tariff provides the government with extra tax revenue. [Person1]:  Anything else. [Person2]:  Tariff raises the price at which the goods are sold in the importing country and therefore makes them less competitive with locally produced goods. [Person1]:  Oh, I know. Thank you. Professor wang. [Person2]:  Do not mention it.
[Person1]:  Do you offer a course in business management?  [Person2]:  Yes, we do.  [Person1]:  How many nights a week is it?  [Person2]:  It's 3 nights a week, Monday, Tuesday and Thursday.

I want to enroll in the course.  [Person2]:  Thank you, please fill out this form for us.  [Person1]:  Do you want me to fill it out now?  [Person2]:  Yes , please. we need a record of you enducation and your work experiences. 
[Person1]:  Hey Mel! Are you up for some tennis today?  [Person2]:  Sorry, I can't! I have to go to work, pick up Jake and Maddie from school, and make them an afternoon snack, then take Jake to soccer practice and Maddie to dance class.  [Person1]:  You sound exhausted. Maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out! She can pick the kids up and take them to their after-school activities. She can also help you do some household chores, and run some errands.  [Person2]:  Oh, I don't know. . . it's hard to find the right nanny . You have to consider her previous work experience, the responsibilities you give her, and how she interacts with the kids. I would love to have someone to help me out, though.  [Person1]:  I think you should definitely consider it! This way you won't have to juggle such a busy schedule, and you'll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings. I can refer you this great nanny Amy. She used to work for my neighbors, before they moved away. She's very responsible, a good cook, and great with kids.  [Person2]:  Oh, that's great. Thanks Grace. Can you give me her number? I'll talk it over with Dan and give her a call tomorrow. Maybe this way I won't be so tired every day, and Dan and I might even get to go on a date once in a while. 
[Person1]:  how did your interview go?  [Person2]:  pretty well. I don't know if I'll get the promotion or not, but I feel good about it.  [Person1]:  if you get the promotion, what will your new title be?  [Person2]:  if I get the promotion, I will be a senior engineer instead of an assistant engineer.  [Person1]:  will you get a pay-raise, too?  [Person2]:  whenever you are given added responsibilities, you should get a promotion.  [Person1]:  that makes sense. Who interviewed you?  [Person2]:  my boss.  [Person1]:  what kinds of questions did she ask you?  [Person2]:  she asked me about my ability to work in a team and what I thought a good boss should be.  [Person1]:  the second one sounds rather difficult to answer. What did you tell her?  [Person2]:  I told her that I'm an excellent team player and that a good boss should treat male and female employees equally.  [Person1]:  those are good answers. How did she react?  [Person2]:  she told me that even when I become a senior engineer, I'll have to work with the assisant engineers as a team.  [Person1]:  what do you think about her as a boss?  [Person2]:  she's pretty easy to get along with. She listens to her employees and treats everyone equally.  [Person1]:  you're lucky. Not everyone has such a great boss!  [Person2]:  that's true. She's highly esteemed among everyone at my company.  [Person1]:  when you find outif you get the promotion or not, let me know.  [Person2]:  I will do. 
[Person1]:  what's your opinion about childless couples? Will you choose to have no kids? [Person2]:  to be honest, I wouldn't. [Person1]:  why? Do you have to make a choice now? [Person2]:  not really. But it has puzzled me for a long time. [Person1]:  what's the puzzle? [Person2]:  my husband and I prefer to have no kids, but my mother-in-law is very traditional and wants grandkids. [Person1]:  oh, I see. I think the older generation tend to think in a different way. [Person2]:  yes. It seems she can never accept a childless marriage. We had a fight last night. [Person1]:  oh, really? Maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren. [Person2]:  but it's absolutely our own business to have a child or not. [Person1]:  definitely. [Person2]:  you know, I often overhear our neighbor, the young couple, fighting about how to raise their kid and I really don't want kids to spoil our happiness. [Person1]:  don't worry. I think in most cases, children are the glue that keeps a family together. [Person2]:  I guess you're right. But I still prefer to have no child. [Person1]:  sure. You can fully enjoy your time together.
[Person1]:  How do you do? [Person2]:  How do you do? [Person1]:  My name is Wang Liang, I ' m from Beijing. Where do you come from? [Person2]:  I come from the city of Tangshan in Hebes Province. [Person1]:  You're from Tangshan? I can't believe my ears. I was also born in Tangshan, but I was brought up in Beijing. [Person2]:  Really? It's nice to meet you. How long have you been with this company? [Person1]:  Just over 4 years now. Since this is your first day here, I'm sure you don't really know too much yet. Let me show you around, so you can introduce yourself to everyone. [Person2]:  Oh, Thank you very much!
[Person1]:  Take care, Peter. Don't run so fast. Are you tired? [Person2]:  Oh, yes. May I sit on the grass? [Person1]:  No, you mustn't sit on the grass. Don't you see the notes? [Person2]:  Yes, I can see it. But what's on it? [Person1]:  It says ' Keep off the grass! ' [Person2]:  Well, there's a bench under the tree. We can sit there. [Person1]:  Be careful. You can't smoke here. [Person2]:  Why not? [Person1]:  Can't you see the notes there? It says ' No smoking here '.
[Person1]:  If we give you the job, what's the most important thing you except to get? [Person2]:  Well, I just want to enjoy what I'm doing it's the most important thing to me. [Person1]:  Just this? [Person2]:  Yes, because I think being interesting thing is the best teacher. Or have more opportunities to have career growth. [Person1]:  Do you want to get a promotion? [Person2]:  Yes, of course. [Person1]:  Where would you like to be in 5 years? [Person2]:  In five years, I'd like to be a senior manager of this corporation. [Person1]:  How do you plan to accomplish this? [Person2]:  By doing whatever is necessary.
[Person1]:  Hey, Jenny. Would you like to go to dinner with me? [Person2]:  I don't know. You know what they say about office romances. [Person1]:  No, I don't. What do they say about office romances? [Person2]:  They say you shouldn't mix love and work. [Person1]:  That's silly. What I do on my own time is no one else's business. Besides, it's pretty hard to meet people outside of the office when we spend long hours here. [Person2]:  You'Ve got a point. Once I dated one of my supervisors and all of my co-workers accused him of favoritism. Then when the relationship went bad, he fired me. [Person1]:  People fall in love with people they work with. That's a fact. [Person2]:  That may be true, but I don't want an inter-office relationship to affect my productivity. [Person1]:  If it does, it will only make you more productive, because we can support each other. [Person2]:  You are sounding like we are already married. [Person1]:  Good grief. All I did was ask you out. I am sorry. [Person2]:  Well, I don't feel right about it. [Person1]:  I am talking about dinner tonight, not a lifetime. [Person2]:  Most starts with dinner, but then it gets out of hand. Besides, haven't you asked out every woman in the entire office? [Person1]:  I like company. [Person2]:  Company? I heard about you from Linda. She said you were an octopus! [Person1]:  What can I say? I am a passionate guy. [Person2]:  Well, I hope you can find something else to be passionate about. [Person1]:  You want to go out with me and you know it. [Person2]:  In your dreams. Now if you don't mind, I've got some work to do. [Person1]:  Ok, I get the message. Hey, do you have any sisters?
[Person1]:  Honey, do you know what color the carrot is? [Person2]:  Mom, it's orange? [Person1]:  Wow, my son is so clever. [Person2]:  Mom, that's a stupid question. [Person1]:  Really? [Person2]:  I am not a child at all. I know more. [Person1]:  Oh, my son looks like a grown-up. [Person2]:  Sure. Mom, I can take care of you. [Person1]:  No kidding. So tell me what's your favorite color? [Person2]:  I like blue. You see, that's the color of the sky. I wanna be a superman. [Person1]:  Why? [Person2]:  I hope I can fly to any place like superman. So I can touch the sky. [Person1]:  OK, superman. Put on your cape, we are going to fly home.
[Person1]:  John, if you don't mind, I'd like to ask you a personal question. [Person2]:  I don't mind at all. [Person1]:  All right. Are you married? [Person2]:  To tell you the truth, I'm not married. I'm still single. [Person1]:  Then, when do you plan to get married? [Person2]:  I don't know. It's still up in tha air.
[Person1]:  I decided to give it a go! [Person2]:  Good for you. What items did you bid on? [Person1]:  A DENY shirt and one of Serena Williams'used tennis rackets! [Person2]:  Your idol! Wow! You're even better at finding stuff than me! [Person1]:  Yep. I placed a bid for the shirt. The minimum was ten so I bet fifty! [Person2]:  That's not how this game works. [Person1]:  Well, there was a sign that said ' Buy now for seventy. ' [Person2]:  How many bids had been placed before you?
[Person1]:  What does it cost to ride this bus? [Person2]:  The fare is $ 1. 25. [Person1]:  Have you been driving buses a long time? [Person2]:  I haven't been driving for long, only for a few months. [Person1]:  Do you like to drive the bus? [Person2]:  Not in the least bit. [Person1]:  I would have never dreamed of ever becoming a bus driver. [Person2]:  I never dreamed of doing this either. The only thing I like about it is the money. [Person1]:  It was really fun chatting with you. [Person2]:  It was really nice talking to you too. [Person1]:  Have a good one. [Person2]:  I'll have a good day once this day is over.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, what time do you expect to land in Berlin? [Person2]:  We should be there by 5 this afternoon. [Person1]:  Do you have any idea how long it will take to clean customs? [Person2]:  Well, it all depends on traffic from other arriving aircraft.

[Person2]:  Well. First, make meaning clear by using concise forma language. Second, describe accurately the exact requirement. Finally, state clearly the permissible variation in quantity.
[Person1]:  Welcome. Can I help you with anything? [Person2]:  Hi. I'm shopping for my boyfriend's birthday. Do you have any suggestions? [Person1]:  Let's see. How about a nice shirt and tie? You can't go wrong there. [Person2]:  Well. He doesn't wear ties that often. [Person1]:  We have some nice pants. You can also get him a belt with it. [Person2]:  That sounds good. Which one do you recommend? [Person1]:  These slacks are very popular. He can wear them to dress up a little or on a normal casual day. [Person2]:  I like them. Do you have matching belts? [Person1]:  Yes. Right over here. [Person2]:  How much are they? [Person1]:  The pants are on sale for $ 40, and the belt is $ 25. [Person2]:  What is your return policy just in case he doesn't like them? [Person1]:  Just save the receipt and we will gladly return or exchange them for you. [Person2]:  That sounds great. I'll take them.
[Person1]:  I was inquiring about a bill that I never got. [Person2]:  Which credit card was the bill for? [Person1]:  The bill was for my Master Card. [Person2]:  That bill should have been mailed about two weeks ago. [Person1]:  It never came in the mail. [Person2]:  My computer shows that it has already been mailed. [Person1]:  I have not gotten my bill, so what should I do about that? [Person2]:  You should try contacting your post office. [Person1]:  If it is the post office's fault, may I have an extension on my bill? [Person2]:  You'll have to prove it was their error ; then you can get an extension. [Person1]:  Thank you for all your help. [Person2]:  You are very welcome. Have a good day.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, I'm looking for the Holiday Inn. Do you know where it is? [Person2]:  Sure. It's down this street on the left. [Person1]:  Is it far from here? [Person2]:  No, it's not far. [Person1]:  How far is it? [Person2]:  About a mile and a half. [Person1]:  How long does it take to get there? [Person2]:  5 minutes or so. [Person1]:  Is it close to the subway station? [Person2]:  Yes, it's very close. The subway station is next to the hotel. You can walk there. [Person1]:  Thanks a lot.
[Person1]:  Hi. Mary. I haven't seen you for a long time. How are you? [Person2]:  Fine, thanks, and you? [Person1]:  I'm fine, too, thanks. How is your job in the factory? [Person2]:  I changed my job two months ago. [Person1]:  Oh, did you? What do you do now? [Person2]:  I'm working as a secretary in a company. [Person1]:  Oh, good! Do you like your new job? [Person2]:  Yes, I like it very much. [Person1]:  I'm glad to hear that. How about coming to my house this Saturday and having a good chat? [Person2]:  Good idea. I'd like that. See you then.
[Person1]:  There is a tornado warning on. My mother just told me she heard it on the radio.  [Person2]:  What is a tornado warning?  [Person1]:  It means that a tornado has been seen somewhere in the area.  [Person2]:  Really? In New Berlin?  [Person1]:  No. Not necessarily in town. But in southern Wisconsin somewhere. A tornado has been spotted. They have two stages here. This is what is called a tornado watch. That means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado.  [Person2]:  I understand. They think a tornado might come.  [Person1]:  Yes. People should look out, because maybe there will be tornadoes coming. So it's called a watch.  [Person2]:  And the second stage is called a tornado warning.  [Person1]:  Yes. If a tornado has been spotted, they announce a tornado warning. So if there's a tornado warning on, it means a tornado is out there somewhere.  [Person2]:  It's scary.  [Person1]:  Well. Tornadoes can be dangerous, it's true. If we hear something like a loud train coming, then we have to go in the basement.  [Person2]:  What do you mean a loud train?  [Person1]:  That is what tornadoes sound like. They sound like trains. They're very loud.  [Person2]:  But if you hear them coming, isn't it already too late?  [Person1]:  Maybe. It depends on the tornado. Some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour. That is very fast. Others aren't so fast.  [Person2]:  Have you seen a lot of them?  [Person1]:  I've only seen one in my life. I was looking out the window. It was around two miles away. It was very interesting to watch. But it was heading toward my friend's house. So I quickly called them on the phone.  [Person2]:  Did it hit their house?  [Person1]:  No, it didn't. But they are glad I called them.  [Person2]:  What were they doing when you called?  [Person1]:  They were all sitting in the living room watching TV. They had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house. If it had hit them, they could have all been killed.  [Person2]:  That's terrible. Do many people die in tornadoes?  [Person1]:  Not so many really. But a lot of houses are destroyed sometimes. 
[Person1]:  Hi! How are you going?  [Person2]:  Fine, thank you. How are you doing this morning?  [Person1]:  Not bad. How about you? Haven't seen you for a long time.  [Person2]:  Yes. I've been to New York. I got back only yesterday.  [Person1]:  Did you enjoy yourself?  [Person2]:  Very much. New York is such a nice place. Shall I show you some photographs?  [Person1]:  Thanks, I like looking at photographs. How nice! Oh, I'm afraid I must be going now. I've got an appointment. Have a good day.  [Person2]:  You too. I hope to see you soon. Goodbye.  [Person1]:  Goodbye. 
[Person1]:  It is really exciting news.  [Person2]:  What news?  [Person1]:  You don't know? The company is going to replace these old computers with the latest ones.  [Person2]:  You know what we will get?  [Person1]:  We will all get a docking station on our own desk from which you can remove your laptop easily. And if you come back to office, you just reconnect your laptop with docking station.  [Person2]:  What docking station?  [Person1]:  This is a kind of socket mounted to your desk. The socket has all the wire connections of the company line and all the other office automation equipments, like fax, copier, a screen, printer and scanner, and it will be very convenient.  [Person2]:  Another big step forward in saving on our office equipment, I don't need a desktop anymore. A laptop is enough. 
[Person1]:  Hasn't it been hard for you without your sister and brother, mom? [Person2]:  Yes, Sam, of course. We haven't seen each other for a long time. [Person1]:  Mom, I have a surprise for you. I'll go on a business trip to Russia. I want you to come with me. You can meet them finally. [Person2]:  No, Sam. It's very thoughtful of you, but I'm too old and sick to travel so far.
[Person1]:  Are you going to buy a bicycle? [Person2]:  I ' m thinking about it. How much is it? [Person1]:  It's 350. [Person2]:  Oh, dear. It ' s too expensive. Can you give me a better price? [Person1]:  Your discount is already included. Normally we charge about 400, but now we can give you a special price. This is our sale period. [Person2]:  It ' s still too much. Can ' t you make it any cheaper than that? [Person1]:  Sorry, but this is the best price. You can ' t get it any cheaper than here. [Person2]:  I see. Can I pay by traveler ' s checks? [Person1]:  I'm afraid you can ' t. You ' re welcome to pay in cash.
[Person1]:  Lester, you are really fantastic at automobile repair. [Person2]:  Thanks, June. But I think I need to be certified as a mechanic before I'm allowed to repair cars for a living. [Person1]:  That's not a big problem. There are many small schools for adults like you who can study to be certified. [Person2]:  I guess I never thought of that before. [Person1]:  And you can easily get a student loan from a vocational school, or from the government. [Person2]:  Wow, you'Ve inspired me to do something!
[Person1]:  May I help you? [Person2]:  I need to copy some pages in my book. [Person1]:  The copier is right over there, in the corner. [Person2]:  Do I need to pay to use it? [Person1]:  You have to pay to use the copier. [Person2]:  How much do you charge? [Person1]:  You need to pay ten cents for every copy. [Person2]:  Is there a maximum number of copies I can make? [Person1]:  You can make as many copies as you want. [Person2]:  I'm going to need you to show me how to use the machine. [Person1]:  There are instructions posted on the copier. [Person2]:  Thank you for your help.

[Person2]:  No, nothing. [Person1]:  Would you open this suitcase, please? [Person2]:  Sure. [Person1]:  Let me take a look at this bag. Can you open it? [Person2]:  Yup. [Person1]:  Is this camera a gift for someone? [Person2]:  No, it's my camera for personal use. [Person1]:  You have to pay tax for this camera. [Person2]:  No, please don't. It's is for my personal use. [Person1]:  You have a lot of gifts, so you have to pay for the camera. [Person2]:  Almost all are for my friends in the States.
[Person1]:  Can you help me pick out a gift for my daughter? [Person2]:  She might like a laptop computer. [Person1]:  Yes, that sounds like a good idea. [Person2]:  Might I suggest a Mac?

[Person1]:  Could you show me some scarves? [Person2]:  What kind of scarf shall I show you? We have them in all sorts and sizes. [Person1]:  Show me some of the latest fashion, please. [Person2]:  At your service. Will this suit you? [Person1]:  Yes, it will ; this must be the foreign produce. [Person2]:  This is Chinese made. [Person1]:  Let me try it on. I think it really suits me. Can you give me some discount on it? [Person2]:  Yes, it's already fifty yuan off the original price. [Person1]:  But that still sounds expensive. [Person2]:  Sorry, we can't come down any more.
[Person1]:  do you need a hand? [Person2]:  no, I can handle it. Thanks anyway. [Person1]:  are you sure you don't need any help? [Person2]:  well, maybe just a little. I can't seem to make it fit. [Person1]:  I swear, the overhead compartments on these planes just keep getting smaller and smaller! [Person2]:  that's so true. thanks for your help. Are you in the aisle seat in this row? [Person1]:  yes. What about you? [Person2]:  I'm in the middle seat. [Person1]:  oh, I guess I'll let you through then. [Person2]:  thanks. sorry for making you get out of your seat again. [Person1]:  that's alright. I notice you have a few newspapers there. Would you mind lending me one? [Person2]:  no, not at all. Which one would you like--the New York Times or the Guardian? [Person1]:  I prefer the British paper, but I'll read whatever one you aren't going to read right away. [Person2]:  I was just going to do a little Sudoku while we wait for the plane to take off, so the Guardian is all yours. [Person1]:  thanks a lot. That's really nice of you. Would you like a piece of gum? [Person2]:  that would be great. thanks.
[Person1]:  Bob, I'm sure you know about second-hand smoke. [Person2]:  Of course, I do. [Person1]:  But have you heard about third-hand smoke? [Person2]:  Third-hand smoke? I'm afraid not. What is that then? [Person1]:  Well, it is here in today's paper. Parents may think they are protecting children from second-hand smoke when they smoke outside their home or only when the children are not there. But now researchers are warning about what they call third-hand smoke. When you smoke dangerous matter from cigarettes get into your hair and clothing. As babies are the weakest, when you come to a baby, you pass it to the baby and increase the chances of disease in the baby. [Person2]:  Is that so? In that case I have to say that I should never get close to a baby. [Person1]:  That's right. Actually all smoking parents should do the same or better give it up completely.
[Person1]:  So how's everything going for Christmas? [Person2]:  I'Ve got all the presents I need, and my family is working together to get all the food ready. That's easy ; but I have another problem to deal with. [Person1]:  What's that? Don't tell me you'Ve still got Christmas cards to write, it usually takes my wife a month to write all of ours. [Person2]:  No, I did that a long time ago. It's about telling my son the truth about Santa Claus. [Person1]:  He still doesn't know that Santa isn't real? How old is he, eight? [Person2]:  Yes. He's never said anything so I never told him. But now that he's getting older. . . [Person1]:  You think it's better that he should be told? [Person2]:  Yes, he's too old to believe in that type of things. And I'd rather tell him before the kids at school do. [Person1]:  That happened to my oldest girl. She became really upset when her classmates told her Santa wasn't real. [Person2]:  I can understand. I was lucky with my oldest ; she figured it out by herself and didn't tell my son. [Person1]:  Well, when you tell him, be gentle. It's hard for kids to find out something like that.
[Person1]:  Good afternoon, sir. What can I do for you? [Person2]:  I'd like to get this prescription filled. [Person1]:  No problem. Please wait a minute. ( She goes to the back for a few minutes. ) Here is your medicine, sir. Take two tablets after each meal and once before bed. [Person2]:  Thanks. Do you sell aspirin here? [Person1]:  Yes, our over-the-counter medicine is over there on that shelf. [Person2]:  Oh, I see it. Do you have multi-vitamins? [Person1]:  Yes, right over here. [Person2]:  ( The customer gets the aspirin and vitamins. ) That'll be $ 16. 00. [Person1]:  Here's a twenty. [Person2]:  Here's your change. Thank you.
[Person1]:  Madison Suites, how may I help you? [Person2]:  Yes, I'm calling from Mexico. I will be in town next week and would like to know if you have availability. [Person1]:  OK ma'am, can you tell me the date you expect to check in? [Person2]:  Yes, July ninth. I will be there for seven nights. [Person1]:  We have a junior single suite or a superior double suite available for those dates. [Person2]:  What's the difference? [Person1]:  The junior suite is smaller and has one twin bed, while the superior suite has a double bed and mini-bar. [Person2]:  OK, I would like to reserve the superior suite.

[Person2]:  Sure, my credit card number is. . .
[Person1]:  Did you attend Alice's presentation last night? It was the first time for her to give a speech to a large audience. [Person2]:  How she could be so calm in front of so many people is really beyond me!
[Person1]:  What's the accommodation like in London, Ahmed? [Person2]:  Well, it's a bit difficult. There are thousands of overseas students here, you know. [Person1]:  Would it be better to stay in a hotel, to share a flat, or to stay with a family? [Person2]:  It would probably be better to stay with a family to begin with, Carla. [Person1]:  You wouldn't recommend sharing a flat? [Person2]:  No, I wouldn't move into a flat if I were you. You won't get much studying done in a flat. You'll spend half your time cooking and cleaning! [Person1]:  How can I find out about families who take in students? [Person2]:  There's a list at the student union building, on campus. The people at the student union should be able to help you find a family to stay with.
[Person1]:  Hello, Old English Restaurant. Can I help you? [Person2]:  Yes. I'd like to book a table for tonight. [Person1]:  Yes, sir. What time? [Person2]:  Eight o'clock. [Person1]:  Certainly. For how many people? [Person2]:  There are ten of us. [Person1]:  Ten of you! But we don't usually accept large parties, sir. [Person2]:  I know, but we are regular customers. [Person1]:  What's your name please, sir? [Person2]:  Michael Peterson. [Person1]:  Mr. Peterson...of course! That'll be all right. We'll put two tables together. [Person2]:  Thanks. [Person1]:  What food would you prefer for today, sir? We have fresh seafood tonight. [Person2]:  No. We like to eat vegetables.
[Person1]:  Hello, may I speak to Mr. Robert the Human Resources Manager? [Person2]:  Wait a minute. I will get him here. Sorry, he is busy doing something. Why don't you give him a ring later? [Person1]:  OK, that's fine. Thank you. [Person2]:  You are welcome.
[Person1]:  I can't bear you anymore. I am sick of your drinking. I am divorcing you.  [Person2]:  Don't do that to me, honey. Give me a chance, please. I make a solemn promise never to drink alcohol again.  [Person1]:  How many chances should I give you? I've given up on you!  [Person2]:  Have a heart, honey. You know I am trying hard to quit drinking, don't you? Just give me one more chance, please! 
[Person1]:  What are we eating for lunch? [Person2]:  I have no idea. What about you? [Person1]:  I kind of want pizza. [Person2]:  I ate pizza the other day. [Person1]:  So, what do you feel like eating then? [Person2]:  How about some burgers? [Person1]:  I already had a burger yesterday. [Person2]:  What are we going to do? [Person1]:  We can just each get what we want to get. [Person2]:  That sounds like a plan. [Person1]:  Do you know a place that sells pizza and burgers? [Person2]:  I think they sell both at the cafeteria.
[Person1]:  I don't believe we've met. [Person2]:  No, I don't think we have. [Person1]:  My name is Gao Run. [Person2]:  How do you do? My name is James Green. [Person1]:  Here's my name card. [Person2]:  And here's mine. [Person1]:  It's nice to finally meet you. [Person2]:  And I'm glad to meet you, too.
[Person1]:  Excuse me. I seem to have lost my son. [Person2]:  Take it easy, madam. And speak slowly. May I have your name first? [Person1]:  Shirley. [Person2]:  What's your son's name? [Person1]:  Daniel. [Person2]:  Can you describe his appearance to me? [Person1]:  He is in a blue sportswear and a white sportsshoes. About 1. 4 meters. [Person2]:  OK, I see. Dear Daniel, please come to the broadcasting station when you've heard this, your mother is waiting for you. If other tourists see a boy in a blue sportswear and a pair of white sportsshoes, 1. 4 meters, please ask him to go to the broadcasting station. Thank you!
[Person1]:  Wow, the view from the peak is so grand! [Person2]:  Look, most of the maple leaves have turned red. [Person1]:  Did you ever see this kind of beautiful scene? [Person2]:  Of course, my father used to take me to Kiang Shan or somewhere like that as a child. [Person1]:  But my father did not. He didn't have much time. [Person2]:  Honey, I'm sorry. I promise you, this summer vacation, I will take you to Huang-Shan Mountains. It is more beautiful and magnificent. [Person1]:  Really? It's a deal. Have you ever been there? [Person2]:  Yes, I went there five years ago. You were still a baby at that time. [Person1]:  It really gets me interested. Is it higher than Kiang Shan? [Person2]:  Surely. You can enjoy the beauty of numerous streams and waterfalls. The sea of clouds has a fairy tale beauty. [Person1]:  Can I see the rainbow? [Person2]:  That depends. If you are lucky, you can see a vivid rainbow across over two peaks.
[Person1]:  Susan has been down recently. I saw her this morning, she looked terrible! [Person2]:  You have any idea why? [Person1]:  She broke up with her boyfriend. [Person2]:  I heard her boyfriend is married. [Person1]:  She still loves him. That's why she feels upset. Her love is always hard and confusing. . . [Person2]:  Then what about you? How are you getting on with your boyfriend? [Person1]:  He sometimes really drives me crazy.
[Person1]:  Betty and I will throw a dinner party this weekend, we'd like you to come. [Person2]:  That would be very nice. Only that I'll be a little late. Is that OK? [Person1]:  Sure. We'll be looking forward to that day. [Person2]:  So will I. Thank you.
[Person1]:  I'm afraid I have lost my air ticket while I was shopping. [Person2]:  I'm sorry to hear that. Did you check your shoulder bag carefully? [Person1]:  Yes, I checked again and again, but I can't find it. By the day after tomorrow, can I have the ticket reissued? [Person2]:  I'm afraid you can't. [Person1]:  I talked with the manager over the phone and he told me I can have it reissued because I have a copy of my lost ticket. [Person2]:  Oh, I see. I'll call the manager, then.
[Person1]:  Juliet, you chose not to go to college. Why? Was it about money? [Person2]:  Well. I don't want to sit here and say I was too poor to go to college. But the fact is that we didn't have the money, though my mum probably could have made enough somehow. I probably could have worked harder at school and gotten better grades, so, it is really, I didn't get to go to college. I had a wish to go back to school every other week. It wasn't just my path. [Person1]:  At the time did you feel that you were missing something? [Person2]:  My best friend went off to university and I just remember every time I talk to her. It all sounded so fun and so great. Here I was selling tennis shoes and getting on the bus every day to work in town. We both thought the other's life was so much more exciting. I was trying hard to make enough to pay for my own flat every month and that seemed so exciting to her. And she would talk about studying for finals, and going to parties, and I thought, God, she is so perfect.
[Person1]:  I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution.  [Person2]:  Yes, I agree. The air here is much more polluted than in my country. Of course, my country is more agricultural and has much less industry.  [Person1]:  We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years,but cars are still a major source of them. Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced.  [Person2]:  The problem is now on a truly global scale. I don't believe that any single country can do anything about it.  [Person1]:  I think you're right. There needs to be an international response to this problem? 
[Person1]:  Our maths teacher is rather humorous.  [Person2]:  On the contrary, I think he's very serious.  [Person1]:  No, not at all. His examples are really interesting.  [Person2]:  So they're easy to remember.  [Person1]:  Yeah, how about your maths teacher?  [Person2]:  He's an old antique, very serious.  [Person1]:  Bad luck, Anne.  [Person2]:  Hey! How about your history teacher?  [Person1]:  She's another antique.  [Person2]:  I'm sorry to hear that. 
[Person1]:  well, I finished my last final today.  [Person2]:  the end of all the hard work for my master's. what a nice feeling to get my degree!  [Person1]:  do you want to attend the convocation?  [Person2]:  certainly. After years of hard work, I wouldn't miss it. By the way, where can I find cap and gown?  [Person1]:  do you want to have them made or do you want to rent them?  [Person2]:  oh, I think they're provided by the school for that special day.  [Person1]:  no. those you have to provide for yourself.  [Person2]:  what do most of the students do?  [Person1]:  well, most of them only need a cap and gown for that particular convocation service, but some of the education majors have had them made, bucause they will be faculty members, and they'll need them f  [Person2]:  then, I might as well have them made.  [Person1]:  Mary, don't move. Stand right there. It's a good shot. The background is very pretty.  [Person2]:  hold it a second. I want to fix my hairpin.  [Person1]:  it doesn't matter. Say'cheese'.  [Person2]:  here's Lisa. May I take a picture with her?  [Person1]:  Certainly. Ok, got you. 
[Person1]:  There will be another sandstorm here tomorrow.  [Person2]:  It's the fourth one this year. Isn't it horrible.  [Person1]:  Yes. We should plant more trees and grass to stop the sand from spreading.  [Person2]:  It may take many years for the trees to grow. I hope people will stop cutting down trees.  [Person1]:  But we need the wood.  [Person2]:  But we can't destroy our forests to get the wood. 
[Person1]:  So what do you want to do tomorrow? [Person2]:  Well, let's look at this city guide here. Huh, here's something interesting. Why don't we first visit the Art Museum in the morning? [Person1]:  OK. I like that idea. And where do you want to eat lunch? [Person2]:  How about going to an Indian restaurant? The guide recommends one downtown a few blocks from the museum. [Person1]:  Now that sounds great. After that, what do you think about visiting the zoo? Well, it says here that there are some very unique animals not found anywhere else. [Person2]:  Well, to tell you the truth, I'm not really interested in going there. Yeah, why don't we go shopping instead? There was supposed to be some really nice places to pick up souvenirs. [Person1]:  No, I don't think that's a good idea. We only have a few travelers checks left and I only have $50. 00 left in cash. [Person2]:  No problem. We can use your credit card to pay for my new clothes. [Person1]:  Oh no, I remember the last time you use my credit card for your purchases. [Person2]:  Oh, well. Let's take the subway down to the seashore and walk along the beach. [Person1]:  Now that sounds like a wonderful plan.
[Person1]:  Hey neighbor, I'm going out of town this weekend and I was wondering if you could take care of my dog while I'm gone. You know, my dog Jaws, don't you? [Person2]:  Yeah. [Person1]:  Just feed him a can of dog food a day and make sure he has plenty of water in his dish. Oh, and he needs someone to take him for a walk around the block every afternoon. [Person2]:  Well, how about if I just throw a ball over the fence to give him some exercise. [Person1]:  No, he really needs a walk. Ah, and he likes to watch the 3 [Person2]:  You must be out of your mind if you think I'm going to watch your dog. I wouldn't watch that dog even if you paid me.
[Person1]:  Hello, Clark Cycle here. How can I help you? [Person2]:  Oh, hello. I saw your ad in the local paper and I'm wondering what kinds of bikes you have, and what your prices are like? [Person1]:  Well, we hire out 3 main types of machine, electric touring and mountain bikes. Are you likely to be riding off-road, do you think? [Person2]:  No, I'll probably be sticking to roads. So, we're touring bike would be best. [Person1]:  Right, well the rate will be 50 pounds for a week or 14 pounds per day. [Person2]:  So it's a lot cheaper to rent by the week. Is there anything else I'd have to pay? [Person1]:  Well, for another 5 pounds, we can supply lightweight bags. There is no charge for things like a pump or for a lock. It's a good strong one, just make sure you don't lose the key. [Person2]:  Huh, so if I do go ahead and hire one. How do I pay? By check or would it have to be cash? [Person1]:  Neither I'm afraid, we can only accept credit card bookings. [Person2]:  I've got a visa in my name will that be ok? [Person1]:  Sure.
[Person1]:  Have you bought a bus pass yet? [Person2]:  I'm not getting one. [Person1]:  Why is that? [Person2]:  It's cheaper if I don't buy one. [Person1]:  Buying a bus pass will save you money. [Person2]:  How do you figure that? [Person1]:  There's no limit to how often you can use your bus pass. [Person2]:  Really? [Person1]:  Plus, you don't have to use change for the bus anymore. [Person2]:  I like that. [Person1]:  You want to buy one now? [Person2]:  I'm going to.
[Person1]:  Do you have a package tour to Hollywood? [Person2]:  Yes, here is the table, which plans do you like best? [Person1]:  The seven-days trip shall be fine. How much is this tour? [Person2]:  $ 300. [Person1]:  We will take the trip. Could you give us a pamphlet? [Person2]:  Here you are.
[Person1]:  Susan, good evening. Why are you so dressed up? [Person2]:  I'm on my way out to a New Year's banquet. How do I look? Is my make-up ok? [Person1]:  You look great.

[Person1]:  What musical instrument do you play? [Person2]:  I can play the piano a bit. [Person1]:  Then we can have one more program at our party? [Person2]:  No, no. My playing isn't good enough for me to perform in public.

[Person1]:  Wow, I can't thank you enough. [Person2]:  Don't mention it.
[Person1]:  Oh, you can rest assured that they'll be no problem. [Person2]:  Why is that? [Person1]:  Your upstairs neighbors live in Canada and rarely come back to Taiwan. When they do, they're never home. [Person2]:  And the downstairs neighbors? [Person1]:  Two flight attendants that are also in and out of town. When they're here, they're usually sleeping. And next door to you is me. I'm a quiet neighbor. [Person2]:  Sounds ideal. We'll get back to you in a couple of days then.
[Person1]:  good morning. What seems to be the problem? [Person2]:  good morning, doctor. I feel terrible. I'Ve got a cold and I have a rash here on my neck. I'm not sleeping well either. What do you think the problem could be? [Person1]:  I'd say you'Ve been working too hard or are under stress for some reason. Have you been taking anything for your cold? [Person2]:  yes, I bought some medicine at the chemist's. I'Ve been taking it for three days. [Person1]:  good. I'm going to prescribe something stronger. It will make you feel drowsy, so you certainly should rest. [Person2]:  OK. I can afford to take a fell days off work. [Person1]:  have you been working hard recently? [Person2]:  yes, I have. I had to get a project finished. It's done now, so I can relax a little. [Person1]:  good. Let's take a look at that rash. . . it looks worse than it is. I'm going to prescribe some ointment for it. If the rash doesn't clear up in a few days, come back and see me. Do you have any other Sy [Person2]:  I have a bad headache, but. . . [Person1]:  don't worry about that. It's probably of the stress you'Ve been under. Just take some aspirin. Combined with the stronger cough medicine, it will make you feel very tired. You shouldn't work or use an [Person2]:  thanks doctor. I'll get these immediately. Goodbye.
[Person1]:  So, when are the other guys going to get here? The train is leaving in 10 minutes. We can't wait here forever! [Person2]:  It's 10
[Person1]:  I heard you have a great new boss. [Person2]:  Yeah. Mr. Watson. He's very intelligent. He invented some products that have made a lot of money for our company. And he never shouts at people. [Person1]:  You're very lucky.
[Person1]:  This is a good basic computer package. It's got a good CPU, 256 megabytes of RAM, and a DVD player. [Person2]:  Does it come with a modem? [Person1]:  Yes, it has a built-in modem. You just plug a phone line into the back of the computer. [Person2]:  How about the monitor? [Person1]:  A 15 - inch monitor is included in the deal. If you want, you can switch it for a 17 - inch monitor, for a little more money. [Person2]:  That's okay. A 15 - inch is good enough. All right, I'll take it.
[Person1]:  Hey, man. What's up? [Person2]:  Ah, first of all, I put a buck in the vending machine for a seventy-five cent candy bar, and the thing got stuck here in the machine. Then, I pressed the change button [Ah, man], and nothing happened. [Wow!] Nothing came out. The dumb thing still owes me a quarter. [Person1]:  Well, did you talk to the man at the snack bar to see if he could refund your money? [Person2]:  Yeah, I tried that, but he said he didn't own the machine, and I'd have to call the phone number on the machine. [Person1]:  What a bummer. [Person2]:  Hey, I have an idea. [What?] Why don't we rock the machine back and forth until the candy bar falls? [Person1]:  Nothing doing. I don't want to be responsible for breaking the thing, and besides, someone might call the cops. [Person2]:  Ah, don't worry. I've done it before. Oh well. Hey, hey, tough luck. Hey, here, take my candy bar. [You mean?] Yeah, the machine and I hit it off earlier today.

[Person1]:  This section of the store is called Junior. Why is that?  [Person2]:  It means young girls. That's where you'll find clothes for young girls.  [Person1]:  But I can't find anything in my size here.  [Person2]:  You're small, but you're not a child.  [Person1]:  Well, there's nothing I can do about my height!  [Person2]:  There's a petite section that you an check out.  [Person1]:  What's in the petite section?  [Person2]:  It has clothes in small sizes for small women. 
[Person1]:  Albert and I need a lot of things to furnish our house. But I don't know where the best place to shop is. Can you give me some advice?  [Person2]:  Sure, Carolyn. I'm happy to help you. What kinds of things do you need right now?  [Person1]:  Well, we have most of the furniture already. We mostly need kitchen utensils, bathroom accessories, cleaning and laundry accessories--things like that. And Albert wants to set up a little offi  [Person2]:  Well, as for Albert, he should go to an office supply store. There's a very good one called Office Depot. They have everything he will need. And their prices are good too. It's very conven  [Person1]:  Can I write that down?  [Person2]:  Sure, it's spelled Office and then D - E - P - O - T. It's in the Yellow Pages.  [Person1]:  Thanks.  [Person2]:  And as for the kitchen things, do you want very high quality?  [Person1]:  What do you mean?  [Person2]:  I mean, do you want the best quality, or do you want good prices?  [Person1]:  Probably good prices. You know we will only be in America for about a year.  [Person2]:  Then I suggest you go to K-Mart or Wal-Mart.  [Person1]:  What are those stores?  [Person2]:  They are very large, discount department stores. That means their prices are very good. And you can find everything you need for the kitchen or bathroom.  [Person1]:  Even silverware?  [Person2]:  Yes, everything. They don't have the most expensive brands, but their quality is usually decent. The main thing is, they have good prices, and they are very convenient.  [Person1]:  I have a friend that said something about a place called Price Club. Do you know about that?  [Person2]:  I have never shopped there, but I think Price Club is a kind of membership store.  [Person1]:  What does that mean?  [Person2]:  That means you have to pay a membership fee to shop there. I have heard they have very good prices on electronics.  [Person1]:  Electronics?  [Person2]:  Yes. Like stereos and televisions.  [Person1]:  How much is the membership fee?  [Person2]:  I'm not sure. But if you are only going to stay a year, I don't think Price Club is good to join. They have great deals occasionally. They are very good for people who like to buy new things all  [Person1]:  I see. Thanks for these tips. We really need to buy a lot of little things.  [Person2]:  I know how it is. Moving is very troublesome. 
[Person1]:  You must have enjoyed using your new camera on your trip. [Person2]:  I would have, but after buying a new camera especially for that trip, I left it in the car of my friend who drove me to the airport.

[Person2]:  Your arms need to be raised to shoulder height.  [Person1]:  Is this OK?  [Person2]:  So far, so good.  [Person1]:  How come you are walking away?  [Person2]:  I am not leaving. I just need you to take a really deep breath, hold it, and then let it out.  [Person1]:  Will I be finished then?  [Person2]:  You will be able to put your clothes on as soon as I have checked the film. 
[Person1]:  Excuse me, Miss, is there a plane to New York? [Person2]:  Uh, let me see. One just left half an hour ago and the next one will be in 2 hours.

[Person1]:  Marry, tomorrow is your mom's fiftieth birthday. Do you know? [Person2]:  Of course I do. How should we celebrate it? [Person1]:  First of all,a birthday present. What about buying her a beautiful skirt? [Person2]:  That's a good idea. It would make her look younger. And a big birthday cake too, with 50 candles. [Person1]:  That's right. Shall we have a special dinner? [Person2]:  How about a Chinese dinner? [Person1]:  Fine, where should we have it? [Person2]:  We can have it at home. I've learned to cook a few dishes from a Chinese friend. I'm sure mom would like them. [Person1]:  All right. Are you going to do the shopping as well? [Person2]:  Why don't we go together, dad? [Person1]:  OK, when? [Person2]:  How about this afternoon?
[Person1]:  Sunshine Travel Agency, Nick speaking. [Person2]:  Hi Nick, it's Pat. [Person1]:  Hi, did you get the tickets for Mrs. King? I sent them this morning.

The head office move the sales meeting to Miami, so she needs to attend the sales meeting there before the opening of the Chicago office. [Person1]:  So she still wants to go to Chicago? [Person2]:  Yes, she still has to be there on March twenty third and then she's moved the interview in Los Angeles to the twenty fourth. [Person1]:  Oh, that's no problem. Leave it to me!
[Person1]:  Good morning, Miss Gray, could I talk with you for a moment? [Person2]:  Yes, Tom, come in. What's the matter? [Person1]:  I want to change my deskmate. [Person2]:  Why? Don't you get on quite well with Lisa these days? [Person1]:  Yes, but actually it is she who wanted to change the deskmate. She said she didn't want to be my friend anymore. [Person2]:  Oh, why? Can you tell me the reason? [Person1]:  Yesterday, she wanted to borrow a pen from me, but accidentally I didn't have an extra 1 to lend her, so she got angry with me and didn't want to be my deskmate anymore. [Person2]:  OK, Tom, it is not so serious actually. Later I will talk with Lisa. I'm sure she will understand you. Now it is time for the math class. Let's go. Oh, by the way, can you help Miss Cook hand out the grated English homework? [Person1]:  Sure. Thank you, miss Gray.
[Person1]:  We need to get a present for Tonya. She is our only granddaughter and she's moving into her new flat soon. Now, she said that she needs some cushions, but I don't know what color her sofa is? [Person2]:  I know that her mother has bought her a set of knives and forks, so why don't we get her a set of glasses? [Person1]:  Actually, she's got glasses already. No, let's get her what she's asked for. I think I'll give her a ring about the color.
[Person1]:  Good afternoon, Mr. Stein. I wonder if you are free tomorrow evening? [Person2]:  I'm not sure, but let me check my schedule. . . Ah, no. I have nothing then. [Person1]:  Great! Our president has asked me to come over to invite you to the banquet held in your honor at the Beijing Hotel at 7 [Person2]:  How nice of him! I'll be delighted to go. But what time would be convenient? [Person1]:  I'll be here to pick you up at 6 [Person2]:  That's good. It's most thoughtful of you to do this, Miss Wood. [Person1]:  It's my pleasure. Well, then, see you tomorrow.
[Person1]:  And we got a 50 thousand dollar ticket for construction workers peeing off the roof. [Person2]:  That's great. Is the electrician here today? [Person1]:  See, I just told you he hit a deer. Man, I knew you weren't listening to me. [Person2]:  You're right. I wasn't. I hear nothing. [Person1]:  Nothing? [Person2]:  Not a sound on the city streets, just the beat of my own heart, I think that's how it goes, something like that. [Person1]:  You and Patricia got engaged, didn't you? You can tell me. [Person2]:  Engaged? [Person1]:  Come on. [Person2]:  Are you crazy? [Person1]:  What? I thought you liked Patricia.
[Person1]:  Hello! [Person2]:  Hello, Mike! This is Jane. [Person1]:  Oh. Hello, Jane! [Person2]:  Listen, Mike! I've got a real problem. [Person1]:  What is it? [Person2]:  The car's broken down. [Person1]:  Oh, not again. [Person2]:  Yeah. I checked the oil and I checked almost everything. It's just not starting at all. [Person1]:  You have to get rid of it, you know.

[Person1]:  why did you lie to me in the email? [Person2]:  I didn't lie. You just didn't ask me my real name. [Person1]:  I should have known it was you. No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly. I thought I might have found the one for me. [Person2]:  I'm sorry. It was cruel of me. But I promise it will never happen again? Look, there's a nice restaurant. Let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over.
[Person1]:  What do you like to do with your free time? [Person2]:  Study English. [Person1]:  You mean you like to study English? Why? [Person2]:  It gives me great satisfaction. [Person1]:  Studying English wouldn't give me any satisfaction. It's hard work. [Person2]:  I don't mind the work. I think it's worthwhile.
[Person1]:  I hear you are moving to Dalian. [Person2]:  Yes. I found a very good job down here. [Person1]:  Well, we'll certainly miss you here. [Person2]:  I am going to miss you, too. [Person1]:  Let's keep in touch. [Person2]:  OK. I will write to you as soon as I get there.

[Person1]:  The blue one is cheaper. It's 80 yuan. [Person2]:  But my daughter doesn't like this color. She likes red best. I'll go to another shop to have a look.
[Person1]:  Judg, I haven't seen you in weeks. Where have you been? [Person2]:  In Florida [Person1]:  What a vacation! While the rest of us are studying on the campus in the February cold. [Person2]:  Not exactly. I was on a special field trip.
[Person1]:  Mr. White, what changes have you seen in the champagne market in the last ten to fifteen years? [Person2]:  Well the biggest change has been the decrease in sales since the great boom years of the 1980s when champagne production and sales reached record levels. [Person1]:  Which was the best year? [Person2]:  Well the record was in 1989 when 249 million bottles of champagne was sold. The highest production level was reached in 1990 with a total of 293 million bottles. Of course since those boom years sales have fallen. [Person1]:  Has the market been badly hit by the recession? [Person2]:  Oh certainly, the economic problems in champagnes' export markets that's Europe, the United States, Japan, and of course the domestic market in France, the economic problems have certainly been one reason for the decrease in champagne sales. [Person1]:  And the other reasons? [Person2]:  Another important factor has been price. In the early 90s, champagne was very overpriced, so many people stop buying it. Instead they bought sparkling wines from other countries, in particular from Australia and Spain. And then there was another problem for champagne in the early 90s. [Person1]:  What was that? [Person2]:  There was a lot of rather bad champagne on the market. This meant the popularity of good sparkling wines increased even more. People was surprised by their quality and of course they were a lot cheaper than champagne. [Person1]:  Do you think the champagne market will recover in the future? [Person2]:  Oh, I'm sure it will. When the economic situation improves, I believe the market will recover.
[Person1]:  Why don't you sit down? Now, there are several questions I must ask you if you don't mind. [Person2]:  Not at all. Go ahead. [Person1]:  What is the purpose of your visit to the States? [Person2]:  I'm going to attend a conference on air pollution. [Person1]:  When and where is this conference being held? [Person2]:  It's being held in the first two weeks of February at the University of Stanford in California. [Person1]:  Who will pay your expenses? [Person2]:  The University of Stanford. Here is the official letter of invitation. [Person1]:  I see. Fine. When do you want to go? [Person2]:  I'd like to leave in mid-January if my passport is ready by then. [Person1]:  That shouldn't be difficult. Why don't you phone me about January 10th? I should be able to give you an answer then. [Person2]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  Oh, the clothes here are so expensive! No wonder there are few people.  [Person2]:  Beauty costs, dear! What do you think of this dress? Do you think it suits me?  [Person1]:  Yeah, it's lovely, but to be frank, it's not the most practical. You don't have many formal events in your calendar, do you?  [Person2]:  Come on, you sound like my Mom. Look at it, it's beautiful!  [Person1]:  When you buy clothes, you must think about the material, quality and price.  [Person2]:  Maybe you have a point.  [Person1]:  Make sure you buy what you need and your clothes can be worn for various occasions.  [Person2]:  All right. How about this black skirt? It can be worn for anything---a party, a job interview and even a funeral!  [Person1]:  That's true, but you already have two balck coats and one black sweater.  [Person2]:  Oh! Hey, look, that's the same shirt Britney wore in her concert.  [Person1]:  Exactly! Oh, my god! I love Britney! I'm going to get it.  [Person2]:  Why not try it on?  [Person1]:  It's just the right size--a perfect fit! I'll take it. Oh, no, I'm a little short. Did you bring your credit card?  [Person2]:  Yes.  [Person1]:  I promise I'll pay you back as soon as we get home. 
[Person1]:  Let me take care of the check today.  [Person2]:  Why? It's unfair. How about going dutch?  [Person1]:  You paid the last time, because I didn't have any money, remember?  [Person2]:  Oh, come on, I almost forgot. Don't worry about it. I didn't mind picking up the tab last time.  [Person1]:  But you really should let me treat one time, I feel like I own you one if I didn't.  [Person2]:  Ok, but it's only for this time.  [Person1]:  What's the damage?  [Person2]:  It's 12 dollars 80 cents all together. But don't forget the tip, it usually 15%.  [Person1]:  Check, please. 
[Person1]:  When're you getting married?  [Person2]:  We planned our wedding for next May.  [Person1]:  Why so late? Didn't she want to get married this October?  [Person2]:  Yeah, I did. But my fiance has an important project.  [Person1]:  That's really a shame. By the way, who will be the bridesmaid?  [Person2]:  Julie's friend, Mary. And John will be the best man.  [Person1]:  Wow! I'm very excited about your ceremony. 
[Person1]:  Have you got any plans for the coming holiday? [Person2]:  Yes, a very special plan. I will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for 2 weeks. [Person1]:  Volunteer work in a zoo? How did you hear that they needed volunteers? From the newspaper or TV? [Person2]:  Neither. A friend of mine working there told me the other day. [Person1]:  Have you sent your application yet? [Person2]:  I sent it a week ago and luckily it was approved by the manager yesterday afternoon. [Person1]:  What specific things will you do? [Person2]:  I will help to feed the animals. [Person1]:  It will certainly be a unique experience. I'm looking forward to hearing your story when you come back and seeing your photos. [Person2]:  I will take as many as possible. [Person1]:  Have you had any experience in voluntary work? You've never told me about that before. [Person2]:  I once helped sell tickets in a cinema. I believe I can do my new job well. [Person1]:  I think so, your one month holiday surely will be meaningful.
[Person1]:  Hello, Jack. Are you having a good holiday? [Person2]:  Hi, mom, don't mention it. It has been raining every day since I got here. [Person1]:  That's a pity and it's been nice and sunny here. When will you be home? [Person2]:  I was going to be back tomorrow. But the flights are fully booked, the next available flight leaves on Thursday. So I have to be back the day after tomorrow. I just hope it won't snow before then.
[Person1]:  May I help you, sir? [Person2]:  Yes, please. I'm looking for a cotton polo shirt. [Person1]:  Any particular colour? [Person2]:  Not really. [Person1]:  How about this one?

[Person2]:  Would you like to see a movie with me and my friend? [Person1]:  Do you know what movie you're going to watch? [Person2]:  I don't know, but was there a certain movie you wanted to see? [Person1]:  None that I can think of. [Person2]:  Well, would you like to go? [Person1]:  Thank you for inviting me, but I think I'll pass. [Person2]:  All right. Another time then.
[Person1]:  What date is it today? [Person2]:  Why? [Person1]:  Look at the girls in the street. They all have a bunch of flowers. Is it Valentine's Day? [Person2]:  Oh, yes! I completely forgot about it. [Person1]:  Did you have a fight with Jack? [Person2]:  No, but now he'll be in trouble. What's a boyfriend for? To forget about Valentine's Day? [Person1]:  Come on, dear! You forgot it, too. [Person2]:  You know, it's OK for a girl to forget these ' big days ', but for a guy, to do that is unforgivable. [Person1]:  Is that your phone? [Person2]:  Oh, it's Jack. Excuse me. [Person1]:  Wow! Good timing. [Person2]:  He asked me out to a dinner tonight. How about joining us? [Person1]:  Come on! Three's a crowd! [Person2]:  So what? [Person1]:  Just go! It's Valentine's Day!
[Person1]:  Hi, Doris. You look a little bit down. What's the matter? [Person2]:  Well, I'm leaving Japan and I'm going back to London, tomorrow. [Person1]:  Really! [Person2]:  Yeah. [Person1]:  How do you feel about that? [Person2]:  Well, I do feel quite down because I am going to miss Japan after being here for 9 months, in Japan. I am going to miss it so much, cause I've had a great time here. [Person1]:  Mm, so what are you going to miss about Japan? [Person2]:  Oh, I am going to miss the people, the food, the night life. Especially the nightlife. [Person1]:  What especially about the night life are you going to miss? [Person2]:  Well, I really like dancing. And I enjoy going out to night clubs and to restaurants and eating Japanese food also and I'm really going to miss that because it's very different to London. [Person1]:  How are the clubs different in Japan than in London? [Person2]:  Well, here there are many different clubs you can get into, for free, you don't have to pay, some of them. In London it's really expensive for drinks and an entry fee.
[Person1]:  Excuse me. My bag was stolen, will you help me? [Person2]:  When did it happen? [Person1]:  Just about half an hour ago. [Person2]:  Tell me where it happened and how. [Person1]:  Yes, it was just when I was walking in the park. I saw some children with a newspaper. [Person2]:  That happens often these days. Well, please fill in this Report of Theft. [Person1]:  I want to get in touch with the Chinese Embassy because my passport was in the stolen bag.
[Person1]:  Hello and welcome. How may I be of service? [Person2]:  Hello. I want to buy some RIB, is it OK to use US dollars? [Person1]:  Yes, of course. What's the amount you'd like to change? [Person2]:  I think 250 dollars should be sufficient. [Person1]:  Please fill out this exchange form and I'll need to see your passport. Don't forget to sign your name at the bottom. [Person2]:  Oh, right, of course. Here you go. [Person1]:  Here is your RIB, the exchange form and receipt and your passport. Please check the amount. [Person2]:  It's correct. Is there any way I can change it back before I leave the country? [Person1]:  Yes, that can be done here. Just make sure you keep the exchange form and the receipt and you can come back at the end of your stay and we'll be only to happy to change it back into foreign currency. [Person2]:  That's wonderful news, thanks for all your help.
[Person1]:  Okay, well I'm sure you have a number of questions to ask me regarding the position. [Person2]:  Yes, well Miss Childs did give mean overview of the position over the phone, but there were some details I'd like to clarify. [Person1]:  Well feel free to ask me anything, and I'll try to fill in the details. [Person2]:  Could I first ask about the remuneration package? [Person1]:  Yes, of course. That's quite an important point, isn't it? As a junior sub editor we offer a starting salary of 150, 000 HK dollars per annum. This doesn't include a generous housing allowance al [Person2]:  I understand. And are there other bonuses included? [Person1]:  Well, apart from full health insurance we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers. But we could go through all the details of that at a later date. [Person2]:  Well, Mr. Parsons, I am flexible when it comes to salary. The opportunity to work in Hong Kong for you is the most important thing for me. [Person1]:  Excellent. Well, what other questions do you have Rebecca?
[Person1]:  Welcome! [Person2]:  Would you give me a bottle of beer, please? [Person1]:  With ice, sir? [Person2]:  No, ice will spoil the taste. [Person1]:  Anything else, sir? [Person2]:  Yes. Something non-alcoholic, please. [Person1]:  Fruit juice, milk or mineral water? [Person2]:  A glass of juice please. [Person1]:  Coming up immediately.
[Person1]:  Well, it's a lovely room. It's quite a nice size, but I don't like green paint very much. Would it be all right if I painted the walls a different color? [Person2]:  Yes, that's fine, as long as you don't paint them a very dark color. One of my hirers painted them black a few years ago. That was terrible. [Person1]:  Is there anything I should know? [Person2]:  Well, I don't allow cat to go upstairs at all. [Person1]:  Oh? Not at all? [Person2]:  No, absolutely not. I don't like animals and I don't allow people to smoke in bedrooms. [Person1]:  Oh, no, no. I agree with that. I don't smoke anywhere. Can I use the kitchen if I want to cook something? [Person2]:  Yes, but only before 7 o'clock in the evening. And I don't allow people to stick pictures on the walls. You know when you take the pictures, marks leave on the wall. [Person1]:  OK. I see. [Person2]:  And one more thing if you don't mind. I don't want any big noisy parties, so only two or three friends at the same time, please. [Person1]:  Oh, right. I'll do that. Well, it sounds fair. Thank you very much.
[Person1]:  Hi, Sarah. What's up? [Person2]:  Oh, hi, I just got out of a history class. I had to give a presentation. [Person1]:  How did it go? [Person2]:  Terribly. I'm sure I made a fool of myself. [Person1]:  Why? Weren't you prepared? [Person2]:  No, it was not that. I just get so embarrassed and nervous whenever I have to speak in front of a group of people. I stand up and my face gets red and then I get even more nervous because I know everyone can see me blushing. [Person1]:  It's not so bad to blush. [Person2]:  But it happens all the time. If the professor asks a question and I know the answer, I blush like crazy if he calls on me. Doesn't that ever happen to you? [Person1]:  No, not really. Maybe you should just try to forget about the people. Look at something else in the room like the exit sign. [Person2]:  I guess I could try that but I doubt it'll help. [Person1]:  You know we talked about it in psychology class. Blushing, even though it's unintentional, is more or less a learned behavior. [Person2]:  What do you mean? [Person1]:  Oh, children hardly ever blush at all. And among adults, supposedly, women blush more than men. [Person2]:  I wonder why. [Person1]:  I don't know, but I had a friend at high schools, Brian Smith. It was really easy to make him blush. He turned red whenever a waitress would ask him for his order. [Person2]:  I'm not that bad. Well,I've got to get going for my next class. I'll talk to you later.
[Person1]:  I'm Paul Adams, Branch Manager. [Person2]:  Katie Thomas. Pleased to meet you. [Person1]:  I take it you're looking for temporary office work. [Person2]:  That's right. [Person1]:  How old are you, Katie? [Person2]:  I'm eighteen. [Person1]:  That's rather young. What experience have you had? [Person2]:  Well, I've just left school, actually, and I'm looking for a job between now and when I go to college. [Person1]:  It doesn't sound as though we can help, Katie. You see, our clients are very demanding, especially when it comes to the new office technology. [Person2]:  Oh, that's no problem. I took extra classes in office skills at school. [Person1]:  Oh, perhaps you'd like to outline what you've been doing? [Person2]:  I started by learning keyboard skills. Then I went on to learn about word processing. [Person1]:  Good. You seem qualified from the technical point of view.
[Person1]:  Hi, Professor Smith. I hear you've written a book titled Visions. [Person2]:  Yes. It explains how science will revolutionize the 21st century. [Person1]:  Could I ask you some questions concerning the book? [Person2]:  Sure. [Person1]:  Are you optimistic about the future? [Person2]:  Generally, yeah. If we go back to the year of 1900, most Americans didn't live beyond the age of 50. Since then, we've had improvements in health care and technology. There is no reason why these won't continue far into the 21st century. [Person1]:  Are we ready for the changes that will come? [Person2]:  Changes are already happening. The future is here now. We have DNA, microchips, the internet. Some people's reaction is to say, we are too old; we don't understand new technology. My reaction is to say, we must educate people to use new technology now. [Person1]:  Is world population going to be a big problem? [Person2]:  Yes, and no. I think that world population will stop increasing as we all get richer. If you are a part of the middle class, you don't want or need 12 children. [Person1]:  Will there be a world government? [Person2]:  Very probably. We will have to manage the world and its resources on a global level because countries alone are too small. [Person1]:  Will we have control of everything? [Person2]:  I think we'll learn to control the weather, volcanoes and earthquakes. Illness won't exist. We'll grow new livers, kidneys, hearts, and lungs like spare parts for a car. People will live to about 130 or 150. For 2000 years, we have tried to understand our environment. Now we'll begin to control it.
[Person1]:  Hi, Mark, haven't seen you for ages. How are you doing? [Person2]:  Can't complain. I'm busy with my experiments in the lab but after work I often play some sports. [Person1]:  Like what? [Person2]:  Like tennis, running and golf. [Person1]:  Golf? That's my favorite game. How often do you play, Mark? [Person2]:  I usually play about once a month. What about you, Michelle? [Person1]:  I play every Sunday. [Person2]:  Even when it rains? [Person1]:  Yes, even when it rains. I never miss a game on Sunday. [Person2]:  Where do you play? [Person1]:  The Lawndale country club. Do you know it? [Person2]:  Yes. I was there once. You're going to play next Sunday, I suppose. [Person1]:  Certainly, listen! Why don't you join me? We can have a game. [Person2]:  I'd love to. What time shall we meet? [Person1]:  Let's meet at the clubhouse at 1 [Person2]:  Good. See you then.
[Person1]:  Hi, Tim. [Hi] I'm really sorry to hear about your dad. My sincerest condolences go out to you and your family. He was such a great man. [Person2]:  Thanks. As you know, he had been sick for some time before he passed away, so we were somewhat prepared. [Person1]:  So, how's your mom taking it? [Person2]:  Oh, it's been really hard on her. I don't think you get over something like that. [Person1]:  Yeah, I'm sure. My heart really goes out to her. [Thanks.] Uh, so how's your mom going to be able to manage things alone? [Person2]:  Well, financially, mom will be able to live a secure life from now on. I mean, Dad had life insurance and substantial investments in property and stocks, so returns on those should take care of her. [That's good to hear.] But our main concern at this moment is her emotional state. [Yeah.] She's really down, so a call now and again should brighten her day. [Person1]:  So, what are the funeral arrangements? The obituary in the paper didn't mention much about the funeral. [Person2]:  Well, some of the family members will get together on Tuesday morning for a private memorial service, but there will be a viewing in the afternoon from 2 [Person1]:  I wish there was something I could do you. * [Person2]:  Well, actually, there is. [Oh?]. You know, Dad really admired you a lot, and before he died, he asked if you'd sing a musical number at the funeral. [Person1]:  Really? I'd be honored. [Person2]:  It would really mean a lot to the family. [Person1]:  Sure. Then, see you on Tuesday. [Person2]:  Okay, see you then.
[Person1]:  We've been cramming for tomorrow's history exam since early this morning. What do you say we take a break and listen to some music, okay?  [Person2]:  Now that you mention it, I'm getting a little bumed-out from studying nonstop, too. Listening to some music for a while would suit me just fine.  [Person1]:  While you're picking out a record to play, I'll grab a couple of beers out of the refrigerator.  [Person2]:  You sure have a lot of discs here.  [Person1]:  Yeah, I've got everything from rock n' roll to the latest new- wave stuff.  [Person2]:  To tell you the truth, I'm strictly into classical music. You don't happen to have any Bach or Mozart, do you?  [Person1]:  Sorry, my taste in music doesn't go back any further than the 1960's. Music written before then is just history to me.  [Person2]:  Well, speaking of history , let's get back to the books. We've got an exam tomorrow , remember? 
[Person1]:  Oh no, what happened in here, Alexa? Why are there some dead plants? [Person2]:  I know. Every planned comes in alive and ends up dead. I definitely do not have a green thumb. [Person1]:  People always say that, but it's not that hard to keep house plants. What did you do to care for this one? [Person2]:  That one had a big flower on it, so I put it in the sunlight. [Person1]:  This is a winter plant from North China. It doesn't do well in direct sunlight, just move it here. Didn't you look up how to care for it when you got it? [Person2]:  No, I just thought it was pretty and it was doing OK in the shop. [Person1]:  And this one here is all yellow, that means you gave it too much water. [Person2]:  Too much water? I think if it doesn't need for water, it doesn't have to drink it. [Person1]:  That's not how plants work, I'm afraid the root system of this one is destroyed. You'll have to throw this one away. Look, here's an app with plant information.
[Person1]:  How are you doing, Andrew? [Person2]:  Not well. I've been feeling pretty lonely lately. [Person1]:  But you have so many friends. How could you be lonely? [Person2]:  You know what they say, a friend to all as a friend to none. I don't feel like I really know any of my friends. In fact, I should probably call them acquaintances, not friends. [Person1]:  What about me? I'm your friend. [Person2]:  I know you are, but you're my girlfriend. I wish I had a guy friend to hang out with sometimes. [Person1]:  I know what you mean, I find it difficult to make new friends, too. It's not as easy as it was when we were young, is it? [Person2]:  Not at all. [Person1]:  I've made a lot of new friends since I started learning English. Maybe you could join a club or take a class to make some new friends. [Person2]:  That's a good idea. [Person1]:  What kind of qualities do you look for in a friend? [Person2]:  I'm not sure. I guess I'd like to meet some people who have a positive attitude and want to have a good time. [Person1]:  People who play ultimate frisbee have a positive attitude. Maybe you should join the ultimate frisbee club. [Person2]:  That's a possibility. Thanks.
[Person1]:  I wouldn't advise you to buy things in bulk from such stores, though. I mean, do your major shopping at the specialized stores. It's much cheaper, and more convenient in the long run.  [Person2]:  Great advice!  [Person3]:  Sort of like Mom's!  [Person1]:  Hey, watch it!  [Person3]:  Just kiddin'!  [Person2]:  Life sounds great in this town! Oh! Before I forget, guys, where can I rent movies? I love watching movies in my spare time.  [Person1]:  Me too! Let's see. There are two video stores close to your apartment. Lucky you! One's Blockbuster, and the other's That's Rentertainment. I believe they both have specials on weekdays, right Will?  [Person3]:  Yup. But not for the new releases. It's usually a buck each for the older movies.  [Person1]:  Are you guys ready to go to the mall?  [Person2]:  Sure.  [Person1]:  Masa, don't forget to take your shopping list with you.  [Person2]:  Thanks for reminding me.  [Person1]:  You're welcome. What are we waiting for? Let's go. 
[Person1]:  Hello, Miss Wu, This is Dan Robson calling from OTC limited. I'd like to check my last order. When exactly was it sent out? [Person2]:  I can check that for you right now. Would you mind holding? [Person1]:  Sure. No problem. [Person2]:  Mr. Robson, I'm sorry. Our computer system is down. Could I call you back later? [Person1]:  Sure. Do you have my number? [Person2]:  Yes, I have it right here. I'm so sorry about this. [Person1]:  No problem. I'll wait for your call.
[Person1]:  Good evening, sir. What can I do for you? [Person2]:  I would like to have my coat washed. [Person1]:  OK, please fill in the form first. [Person2]:  That's it. By the way when can I get it back? [Person1]:  We will send it to your room at 4 [Person2]:  Well, but I need it tomorrow morning. [Person1]:  We have express service as well. It charges 30 % more but I assure your coat will be ready tomorrow morning. [Person2]:  That's fine. Please send it to my room tomorrow morning.
[Person1]:  David, what have you been up to lately? [Person2]:  I went on a trip with my family last week. [Person1]:  Really? Where did you go? [Person2]:  We went to Europe. [Person1]:  What cities did you go to? [Person2]:  London, Paris and a few other cities. [Person1]:  Did you go to Berlin? [Person2]:  No, We didn't go there. I'd like to go there next time. [Person1]:  I think this summer is a good time to visit Berlin. It's a beautiful place and the people there are very nice. [Person2]:  That's what I've heard. [Person1]:  I went there last year. If you want, I can give you some information I have about the city. [Person2]:  Thanks.
[Person1]:  Do you often buy magazines? [Person2]:  I buy a computer magazine every month. It keeps me up-to date with all the latest developments. [Person1]:  Why don't you find the information on the internet instead? [Person2]:  Sometimes it takes too long to find the exact information you are looking for. Besides, I like to read a magazine in a coffee bar sometimes. [Person1]:  Do you have an online edition of that magazine? [Person2]:  Yes, they do. But you can only access all the articles if you have a subscription. [Person1]:  Do you have a subscription? [Person2]:  Yes, I do. The magazine arrives by post at the beginning of each month. Do you every buy magazines? [Person1]:  I only buy them if they look particularly interesting. I don't buy any regularly.
[Person1]:  What a letdown. I wanted to experience some Mafia culture firsthand. [Person2]:  It's worth it just to go and eat what the mafia eat! The five-dollar tiramisu is a culinary orgasm. [Person1]:  Such a thing exists? [Person2]:  Fortunately, yes. You're blushing! [Person1]:  Am I? Um. . . my face gets red when I walk too fast. [Person2]:  You're embarrassed, aren't you? You gotta loosen up in Little Italy. The lady at the cafe will kiss you when you meet her. . .
[Person1]:  Lucy, where are you going? [Person2]:  I want to go to the supermarket. [Person1]:  Wait a few minutes and I'll go there with you. [Person2]:  Let's get a shopping cart. [Person1]:  Good idea [Person2]:  What are you going to buy? [Person1]:  Let's check out the fruit section first. [Person2]:  OK. I'd like some oranges. But they don't look quite ripe yet. [Person1]:  Look, nice fresh cherries! They are ripe and soft. I'll take some. [Person2]:  I'll take some, too. [Person1]:  Let's go to the snacks section. I want some chocolate and sweets. [Person2]:  OK. I'll go and buy some cakes. [Person1]:  Do you want to buy something else? [Person2]:  No. Let's go over to the check-out stand.
[Person1]:  Have you been feeling OK lately? [Person2]:  My coach wants you to check my blood pressure. [Person1]:  Has anyone ever told you that you had high blood pressure? [Person2]:  I don't have any symptoms of high blood pressure. [Person1]:  People with high blood pressure seldom know they have it, which is why we call it the silent killer. [Person2]:  What test do you do for high blood pressure? [Person1]:  We will pump air into this cuff to get a reading. [Person2]:  When you get the reading, what information does it give you? [Person1]:  It tells me how hard your heart pumps blood and how much your arteries relax at rest. [Person2]:  I am hoping that this test goes well for me.
[Person1]:  Would you please bring me the black suit? I want to try it on. [Person2]:  Here you are. [Person1]:  I think this suit fits perfectly. [Person2]:  Yes, I think so. The suit matches the trousers. [Person1]:  It's fine. Please wrap it.
[Person1]:  Excuse me. Does this hotel have a fitness facility? [Person2]:  Yes, we try to accommodate all needs of our patrons, including fitness. [Person1]:  Where is your fitness facility located? [Person2]:  The gym is just below the lobby. Take the elevator or the stairs. You can't miss it. [Person1]:  Is there an additional surcharge for the gym? [Person2]:  No, the gym is free to guests. Take your room key, however, so you can get in. [Person1]:  What time is the gym open, and what time does it close? [Person2]:  The gym is open seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day. [Person1]:  Do you offer trainer services along with the gym? [Person2]:  Unfortunately, no. If you want a trainer, you'll have to use another gym.
[Person1]:  have you finished going through the contract? [Person2]:  yes, but I have a few questions for you. [Person1]:  Ok. Ask away. [Person2]:  first, I'd like to know if you offer employees sick leave. [Person1]:  yes, employees can take up to 10 days of sick leave per year. However, in order to get paid, you'll have to bring in a note from the doctor's. [Person2]:  even if I'm only sick for one day? [Person1]:  that's correct. [Person2]:  that's pretty strict, if you ask me. [Person1]:  well, we'Ve had to add that to the contract because we found that many of our employees were taking almost one sick day a month, even though they weren't sick. [Person2]:  I see. I guess that makes sense. [Person1]:  do you have any other questions? [Person2]:  yes. Maternity leave is mentioned in the contract, but there's nothing in the contract alout paternity leave. Do you offer anything to fathers? [Person1]:  we do actually. We can add that as an amendment to your contract. [Person2]:  how many days of paternity leave do you offer? [Person1]:  men are allowed to take 10 days of paternity leave for their first child. [Person2]:  why are women allowed so much more time for maternity leave? [Person1]:  well, women are the ones giving birth. I think it's fair to give them more time, don't you? [Person2]:  I guess so. I don't have any other questions. Should I sign here then? [Person1]:  yes, please.
[Person1]:  I can see this is quite an old house. [Person2]:  Well, in America, it's quite old. But in England, it's actually quite young. [Person1]:  How much are you asking? [Person2]:  $110,000, but it's negotiable, since I need cash urgently. [Person1]:  I see. I suppose this is the living room? [Person2]:  Yes, you're right. Look at the fireplace. It was hand-made. The design is really unique. You can't find it anywhere else. [Person1]:  Yes, I like it very much. Can I see the kitchen, please? [Person2]:  This way, please. Look, it's spacious and bright, and quite modern. [Person1]:  I am satisfied with this house, but the price is a little too high. Can you make a concession?
[Person1]:  Good afternoon! Can I help you?  [Person2]:  Could you show me where the Chinesc-style clothing is located? I want to buy a silk coat.  [Person1]:  This way, please. Here they are. They're all handmade.  [Person2]:  Oh, they look nice. May I try that black one on?  [Person1]:  Of course. The fitting room is right over there.  [Person2]:  Do you have a medium in the same color? This one is a little tight.  [Person1]:  l'm sorry. All the black of that size are sold out. Would you like a red one?  [Person2]:  OK. Let me try it on. What do you think?  [Person1]:  Oh, that suits you very well. Besides it is believed in China that the red color brings happiness and good luck.  [Person2]:  Really? I'II take it and I'm leaving here tomorrow. Is it possible for you to send one in black to me by mail when you get it in?  [Person1]:  Our pleasure. Please fill out this form, leaving your address and telephone number.  [Person2]:  Thanks. How much would that come to?  [Person1]:  Let me see. . . 
[Person1]:  Good morning. You don't look very well. What's the matter? [Person2]:  Migrate went down recently, so I am very anxious. [Person1]:  Oh really? [Person2]:  Yeah, but I know you always do well in your studies. Could you tell me how you do it? [Person1]:  In fact, I don't think I have any special methods. I just like discussing things with my classmates. [Person2]:  Well, now I think discussions are great. Everybody can express his own opinion and learn from each other. Meanwhile, they also help us build our confidence and have courage to express our opinions. [Person1]:  You're right, but you could also be influenced by others in a bad way. You have to decide whether these kinds of discussions are suitable for you and whether they would be useful for your studies. I also like reading books. [Person2]:  Yeah, that is a good method. But I just don't like reading very much. Maybe that's why I'm not doing very well in my studies.
[Person1]:  Do you want to get some lunch with me? [Person2]:  Sure. You mean from the coffee shop in the mall? [Person1]:  I eat there every day. Let's eat somewhere else for a change. I was thinking of Romano's. And don't worry, today it's on me. I got a reward from my boss for my good work. [Person2]:  Great. That's very kind of you. We'll take my car or at least let me pay for the taxi. [Person1]:  There is no need. They just opened up a new one a couple of blocks away. I could use the fresh air anyway. [Person2]:  Sounds good. Let's go.
[Person1]:  Mom, what are we going to make tonight? [Person2]:  Curry and rice. What do you think? [Person1]:  That sounds nice. I can peel the potatoes first. [Person2]:  Really! Oh, honey, you are so sweet. I'll chop up this carrot. [Person1]:  Mom, the water is boiling! [Person2]:  Honey, just turn down the stove.
[Person1]:  Who are those guys? [Person2]:  Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O ' Neal, they are the Los Angeles Lakers ' star players. [Person1]:  Oh. [Person2]:  Wait a second. He shoots, he scores! [Person1]:  All right! [Person2]:  Here comes Jordan, though. [Person1]:  Wow, Michael Jordan ' s slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch. [Person2]:  Yeah. He ' s older, so he doesn ' t slam as much as he did when he was younger, but when he does, it ' s still amazing. [Person1]:  Which team do you think will win? [Person2]:  The Lakers. Jordan is the only good player Washington has.
[Person1]:  What do you think of the new television channel? Aren't the programs awful? [Person2]:  I quite agree with you. They are terrible. They are complete waste of time, but my wife disagrees with me. [Person1]:  Actually, what bothers me is the violence. There are far too many detective and police shows. [Person2]:  I couldn't agree with you more. There aren't enough educational programs, and even the news shows are not well done. [Person1]:  You are absolutely right. They are too brief. They don't tell you anything.
[Person1]:  I'm sorry for being late. [Person2]:  You're supposed to stand here quietly until the flag - raising ceremony is over. [Person1]:  About what time can I go to my own class? [Person2]:  When everything is over. [Person1]:  Now that it is all over. can I go now? [Person2]:  Not yet. You should stand still for another few minutes. Late-comers must be recorded. [Person1]:  That's too bad!
[Person1]:  Oh, my! It's really hot. I've never seen such scorching weather in my life. [Person2]:  Tell me about it! It's like the whole world is broiling. [Person1]:  Oh, look at the thermometer! The temperature has hit 98. [Person2]:  I hope it's not gonna break into three digits [Person1]:  But it's already awfully close. [Person2]:  Well, I just hope it'll level off. [Person1]:  I guess you can't do anything until after dark then. [Person2]:  I guess so. What else can we do? You can't stay in the heat for long.

As you all should know by now, this class meets on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3 [Person2]:  That's terrible. He speaks too fast. How can I catch his meaning? [Person1]:  Again, as you see on your course outline, grading is determined by your performance on a midterm and a final test, periodic quizzes, and classroom participation. [Person2]:  I'm not sure whether I can pass the course or not.

[Person1]:  You know Iden, I don't know much about you. Where were you born? [Person2]:  I was born in London, but I spent most of my childhood in Hongkong. [Person1]:  What was your childhood like? [Person2]:  I had a pretty strict up-bring, and my parents and I were always fighting about it. [Person1]:  Do you get along with your parents now? [Person2]:  Oh, sure. Once they reached middle age, they became a lot less uptight. [Person1]:  Where did you go to university? [Person2]:  My parents wanted me to stay in Hongkong, but I decided to go back to England, I graduated from Oxford University with a degree in English literature. [Person1]:  What's your current occupation? [Person2]:  I'm a freelance writer. i write magazine articles and fiction books [Person1]:  Did you always know you wanted to be a writer? [Person2]:  No, I didn't. I was an english teacher for about five years, but by the time I was thirty, I decided I want a fresh challenge. [Person1]:  How did you start writing? [Person2]:  I started writing margin articles for fun, and eventually was asked to write a book, so I was pretty lucky. [Person1]:  Are you writing a book now? [Person2]:  Yes, it's about a group of friends living in a foreign country, and all the strange experiences they have [Person1]:  Sounds interesting.

[Person2]:  He isn't in trouble. I hope he's doing well in all his lessons. He'll do well in the exams. [Person1]:  Except in Chinese. I'm afraid. He says that he is a little weak in Chinese. [Person2]:  Is he? I'm sorry to hear that. [Person1]:  That's why I've come to see you. I'm worried about his Chinese. He may fall behind the others when he comes back. [Person2]:  What do you mean? [Person1]:  We'll go back to London for a holiday for two months. We haven't been back for three years. [Person2]:  I see. I think that maybe his Chinese teacher can give him some homework to do during the holiday. He won't fall too far behind the others when he comes back.

[Person1]:  Yes, he is waiting for you in Room 123.  [Person2]:  Thank you very much. May I come in?  [Person3]:  Come in, please.  [Person2]:  Good moring, Mr. Smith. I am Sunfang coming for an interview.  [Person3]:  Nice to see you. Take a seat, please.  [Person2]:  Thank you.  [Person3]:  We've been looking over your application. I see you've got several years experience in secretarial work. What kind of work did you do in your previous job?  [Person2]:  I mainly did typing, filing, answering telephone calls and such routine work in the beginning. I started the job as a junior secretary, but within the year I was promoted to senior secretary of Southeast Company. I drafted business correspondence for the general manager.  [Person3]:  Then what's the reason that promoted you to leave Southeast Company?  [Person2]:  Last month the company moved to Guangzhou for further development. I was reluctant to relocate because I love Nanjing so much.  [Person3]:  Tell me what you know about our company.  [Person2]:  Your company is the leading dealer in the import and export of cosmetics. Also, you have a reputation for being a good company to work for and you are in last year's top 500 Employers list.  [Person3]:  Tell me three positive qualities your coworkers would use to describe you and your work style.  [Person2]:  First they'd say I am very punctual. They'd also say I am a cheerful person to work with I don't bring my problems to work. I try to have a positive attitude about work. And thirdly, they'd say I am flexible I accept change easily.  [Person3]:  Tell me something about your education.  [Person2]:  I graduated from Yangzhou Junior College. Now I am attending evening classes in Nanjing Radio & TV University three times a week. My major is International Trade. I've already passed over half of the compulsory courses and five optional courses, and expect to receive a B. A. degree next year.  [Person3]:  I see you are an ambitious young lady. I wish you can make greater progress in the future. 
[Person1]:  What's the problem, Nada? You look down in the dumps.  [Person2]:  I don't know. My life is a big mess. Everything is so compliceted.  [Person1]:  Come on, nothing can be that bad.  [Person2]:  But promise me, you'll keep it a secret.  [Person1]:  Ok, I promise. So what's troubling you so much?  [Person2]:  I've fallen in love with my boss.  [Person1]:  Really? Is he married?  [Person2]:  Bo, of course not. He is still single.  [Person1]:  Then what's your problem?  [Person2]:  I try to keep it to myself. But there is a lot of gossip about us.  [Person1]:  Oh, I see. Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip.  [Person2]:  Worse still, he is trying to avoid me these days.  [Person1]:  Office romance is very tricky.  [Person2]:  It gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed.  [Person1]:  Cheer up, Nada. You'll be fine. 
[Person1]:  I've been having trouble breathing lately, so I made a doctors appointment for Monday morning. [Person2]:  I thought you just went to the doctor for that same problem. [Person1]:  No, I went last Tuesday because I had a cough. The time before that, I couldn't feel my legs, but it turned out that I just stood for too long. [Person2]:  That happened to my uncle once. While I hope it turns out OK for you. Let me know if you need me to bring anything over for you tomorrow after the appointment. [Person1]:  Thanks. You're a good friend.
[Person1]:  You look really wiped out.  [Person2]:  I had meetings back to back all morning. Then the printer broke in the middle of putting together the Wix Soap presentation, and the phone rang off the hook from the minute I walked into the office.  [Person1]:  Not a good day, I hate to tell you that Mr. Emory wants to see the designs for the Polish Paste Ad tomorrow morning.  [Person2]:  I can't believe it! I guess I'll be here until ten again tonight! 
[Person1]:  What did he say?  [Person2]:  He said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man.  [Person1]:  It's too good to be true! If I were there, I would ask him if he himself was a successful man.  [Person2]:  Nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question, you know. 
[Person1]:  When in Rome, do as the Romans do, they say.  [Person2]:  What do you mean?  [Person1]:  Roman is living in Rome, of course. And go to work by car, or bus, or on foot.  [Person2]:  I think the Romans do what everyone else does.  [Person1]:  Certainly.  [Person2]:  And Roman really loves life. He knows how to enjoy himself.  [Person1]:  Not always. But they like good meal.  [Person2]:  Really?  [Person1]:  How can I go there to have a taste?  [Person2]:  By air of course. 
[Person1]:  Have you chosen the music for the party yet? [Person2]:  I was going to just let people bring their own. [Person1]:  Oh, I don't think you should do that. One person needs to be in charge. Otherwise, people will start disagreeing. Sony's really good at music. You could ask her. [Person2]:  OK. Have you got her number? [Person1]:  Yeah, it's on my mobile. I'll text it to you.
[Person1]:  Nice to meet you, Peter. [Person2]:  Welcome to my home. Come in, please. [Person1]:  Who is the man I met at the gate a moment ago? [Person2]:  Do you mean the man wearing a pair of sunglasses? He is my neighbor. We have been neighbors for 20 years. [Person1]:  Really? I haven't met him before, though I have been here several times. [Person2]:  He is a pilot named Jack. He has been to many countries in the world. [Person1]:  How lucky he is. [Person2]:  But his wife isn't so lucky. She always stays at home alone. [Person1]:  I see. Haven't they got a child? [Person2]:  No, they considered Charlie as their son. It's really a kind pet dog.
[Person1]:  Adam, I heard you want to get in shape. Why not join the club I am in? [Person2]:  Is it far from our neighborhood? [Person1]:  No, it's just 10 minutes away from here by bike. [Person2]:  What do you do there? [Person1]:  Well, I often start out running for about half an hour and then I get in the swimming pool for an hour. [Person2]:  I really like swimming. It's a good way to lose weight, isn't it? [Person1]:  Oh, it certainly is. I was 135 pounds when I joined the club. Now I weigh just 120 pounds, and I'm sure I'll manage to lose another 10 pounds by the end of July. [Person2]:  That's amazing. Perhaps I'll go and have a look at your club tonight.
[Person1]:  Hello. Excuse me. [Person2]:  Yes. Can I help you? [Person1]:  Do you remember me? I just had lunch here a half hour ago. [Person2]:  Of course I remember you. [Person1]:  I think I lost my wallet here. [Person2]:  Oh, no. Really? I didn't see anything. [Person1]:  Really? You didn't find a wallet? [Person2]:  No, I didn't. Would you like to go look by the table with me? [Person1]:  Yes, I would. It's not here. And it's not on the floor.Has anyone sat at this table since we left? [Person2]:  No. It's been empty the whole time. [Person1]:  Hmm. I don't know how it could have happened. [Person2]:  I remember, sir, that your friend took the bill.You didn't pay for the lunch yourself, did you? [Person1]:  No. My friend did. [Person2]:  Then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here? [Person1]:  No, I'm not sure. But I usually take out my wallet when I sit down.It ' s uncomfortable to sit on it. So I usually put it next to me on the table. [Person2]:  Maybe you lost it before you came here. Or maybe you left it at home. [Person1]:  I don't think it's at home. I think I had it when I left the house.But what should I do? [Person2]:  Well, the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home.Then, if it isn't, you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards. Next, you need to replace whatever you lost, your driver's license, things like that. [Person1]:  Should I call the police? [Person2]:  You can if you want. But the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets. [Person1]:  Hmm. I'll go home and check. Maybe you're right. Maybe it's at home. [Person2]:  I'm sorry we couldn't find it, sir. [Person1]:  Thanks for your help.
[Person1]:  I was wondering if you need any help on your new project. [Person2]:  Sure! That would be great! Are you good at writing or would you rather do the computer work?

[Person1]:  Good afternoon. Can I help you? [Person2]:  I'd like to leave this bag with you. [Person1]:  OK, sir. Is there anything valuable or breakable in it? [Person2]:  Well... there is a necklace in it. [Person1]:  Would you mind taking the necklace with you, or leaving it at the safe deposit box? [Person2]:  Well, don't bother. I'll take it with me.

[Person1]:  Unfortunately, according to our regulations I have to confiscate these counterfeit notes. [Person2]:  So, this 500 RMB is worthless? [Person1]:  I'm sorry but it is our regulation, so I must follow it. We will issue you with a receipt to show that the notes you presented us with are counterfeit and have been confiscated. Then, if you wish to pay in some more cash, you are free to do so. [Person2]:  Right, I see. Let me give you another 500 RIB.

[Person1]:  Can you eat the nut? [Person2]:  No, you peel off the skin and throw out the nut. [Person1]:  How much are they? [Person2]:  Well, the sale price is $ 1 each. [Person1]:  What does a mango taste like? [Person2]:  They're like a citrus fruit. [Person1]:  How do I know if it's ripe? [Person2]:  You can buy them hard. Wait a few days for them to develop a soft feel. [Person1]:  Where do they come from? [Person2]:  Most of them in this store are from Mexico.
[Person1]:  OK, that's fine. Bye. [Person2]:  What happened? [Person1]:  That's it, my lease is up. I have to move. [Person2]:  What? Why? Can't you renew it? [Person1]:  The owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking lot [Person2]:  Well, I can help you pack. We should start looking for a new place for you ASAP. [Person1]:  I think I might move in with my parents for a couple of months until I can find something. You know how hard it is to find a decent place around here. I'm gonna have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while. [Person2]:  Well, let me know if there's anything I can do to help out. [Person1]:  Actually, would you mind looking after my pet tarantula and snake for a couple of weeks? [Person2]:  Hehe. . sure
[Person1]:  hello. Where are you headed today? [Person2]:  I'm off to Barcelona for a week. [Person1]:  do you have your passport with you? [Person2]:  yes, here you go. I don't need a visa to go to Spain, do I? [Person1]:  fortunately for you, you don't. Next time, if you have any questions about visas, you should try to find out before you get to the airport. [Person2]:  that's good advice. [Person1]:  would you like a window seat or an aisle seat? [Person2]:  are there any seats available by the emergency exits? [Person1]:  let me see here. . . yes, there's one left. [Person2]:  ok. I'll take that one then. [Person1]:  alright. How many pieces of luggage are you checking in? [Person2]:  I like to travel light so I just have this one. [Person1]:  if that's your only piece of luggage, it is small enough to carry on with you. Would you like to do that so you don't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive? [Person2]:  yes, please. That's a fantastic idea. Which gate do I need to go to? [Person1]:  you're here a bit early, so check the departure screens in the waiting area in about a half hour. Here's your boarding pass. Enjoy your flight!
[Person1]:  I want to say goodbye to everyone. [Person2]:  You're leaving so soon. When are you off? [Person1]:  I'm catching the nine fifteen train tomorrow morning. [Person2]:  how about I come and see you off? [Person1]:  You really don't need to. [Person2]:  Ok. I'll miss you. I hope we can see each other again soon. [Person1]:  I hope so, too. Thank you, Lily. Thank you for everything. [Person2]:  You're welcome. [Person1]:  Please say goodbye to the rest of the family for me. [Person2]:  Ok. Take care. I hope you have a good journey. [Person1]:  Thank you. Remember to look me up if you're ever in Washington. [Person2]:  Of course. I will. [Person1]:  Goodbye, then. Thanks again for everything.
[Person1]:  . . . Now, that's all I want to say about world coal reserves. So let's move on to the next topic, renewable resources. There are three things we have to consider when talking about renewable resources. First, sustainability ; second, marketability ; lastly, the reality factor. Let's talk about each point in more detail. . . John, would you like to take it from here? [Person2]:  Certainly. As my colleague just mentioned, sustainability is a major concern when examining the potential output of a resource. Of course, as you can see from the content of our presentation today, with renewable resource, there is a much larger sustainability than with non-renewable resource.
[Person1]:  What do you plan on making as a side dish for dinner? [Person2]:  I was planning on making some kind of vegetable. [Person1]:  Do you know what kind? [Person2]:  What kind of vegetable do you want? [Person1]:  I wouldn't mind eating some corn. [Person2]:  How do you want it? [Person1]:  What do you mean? [Person2]:  I can boil it, grill it, or microwave it. [Person1]:  You should throw some corn on the grill. [Person2]:  Is that really what you want? [Person1]:  That sounds good. [Person2]:  I guess I can do that.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, Professor. I am going to miss next week's class. [Person2]:  Is this something that you could schedule for another time? [Person1]:  No, I have to do this ; it's important! [Person2]:  Have you arranged for someone to take notes for you? [Person1]:  I've made arrangements with a friend to help me. [Person2]:  You know that I only allow one absence per semester, don't you? [Person1]:  Yes, I know. [Person2]:  Write down your name and the date on a piece of paper and give it to me. [Person1]:  OK, I can do that. [Person2]:  Well, have a good day off from class.
[Person1]:  I'm going to buy a new living room set. [Person2]:  Where are you going to buy one? [Person1]:  I'm really not sure. [Person2]:  You like my living room set, don't you?

I'm going out with some friends. [Person2]:  Well, how about the following night? [Person1]:  No, I can't on Saturday either. My sister and her husband are coming to town and I want to show them around. [Person2]:  Sunday, then? [Person1]:  Well, I'll probably sleep all morning and in the afternoon I want to go to the football game. [Person2]:  Michael, that leaves Monday, the night before the test. [Person1]:  Actually, I've got plans for Monday night too. How about early Tuesday morning? [Person2]:  Michael, the test is on Tuesday morning.
[Person1]:  Hello, Bill. You are reading the novel again. [Person2]:  Yes, I will never be tired of it. I have read three times. I can always learn something new from it every time I read it. [Person1]:  Really? Who's the writer? [Person2]:  Charles Dickens. I think he's a great English writer. What about you? [Person1]:  So do I. He is also my favorite foreign writer. What do you think about it? [Person2]:  It's exciting. [Person1]:  Where did you buy it? [Person2]:  In the Rese Bookshop. [Person1]:  I don't know where it is. Is it far from here? [Person2]:  No. Only 10 minutes' walk from here. Next to the People's Cinema. [Person1]:  Oh. I see. I am going there to get one, too. Thank you. [Person2]:  You are welcome.
[Person1]:  This sucks. I hate buying lingerie. Okay, just find something and get out of here. Alright, these are fine. Oh, no, don't come over here, don't come over here.  [Person2]:  You look a little lost, can I help you?  [Person1]:  Um, I'm just having a look around. It's my girlfriend's birthday tomorrow. I'm trying to find her something.  [Person2]:  Well, you can't give her granny panties. Have you thought about getting her somesleepwear? We've got these lovely, silky nighties. Or, how about a nice panty-and and-bra set. Look, here's a nice satin push-up bra, and you can choose a few different styles of undies to go with it.  [Person1]:  Sure that's fine. This is so awkward. . . what ones do I pick? What size is she?  [Person2]:  Well, do you want a thong, some bikini briefs, maybe this nice pair of lacy boy shorts?  [Person1]:  Just pick something and get the hell out of here. Um, I'll go with these two. This is mortifying. I just want to get this over with. She better thank me for this. . .  [Person2]:  Here you are, sir. I'm sure she'll enjoy them.  [Person1]:  Finally!  [Person2]:  I'm sorry, sir. I'm going to have to take a look inside your bag. 
[Person1]:  The blake's got divorced.  [Person2]:  Really? Why?  [Person1]:  Mr. black has been getting a little around aside.  [Person2]:  I'm surprised. He does't look like a guy who'd ever cheat on his wife, does he?  [Person1]:  No, he doesn't. But his wife found out he has been too charming for a long time. Incredibly, he has many different girlfriends. Starting almost right after they married 20 years ago.  [Person2]:  Well, I'm really surprised. You are not doing anything behind my back, are you?  [Person1]:  No, the only thing I've ever done behind your back is zip you up, besides I told all my other girlfriends, and my wife who's getting suspicious. and we had a cold for a while, tell the  [Person2]:  Haha. . . You are not very funny. I guess that means --except me to tell my lover we have stoped seeing each other too.  [Person1]:  You are not funny either. I can't believe I married a woman like you. 
[Person1]:  So do you believe in palmistry?  [Person2]:  Palmistry? What is that?  [Person1]:  It's when someone takes a look at another person's palm to tell the future.  [Person2]:  Oh, you mean palm reading. I've seen that before, but I don't believe in it.  [Person1]:  Are you sure? I've read a lot about palmistry and I've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm. Do you want me to take a look at your hand?  [Person2]:  Really? You've read books about it? Ok, then. But only if you want to.  [Person1]:  Ok, let's see, well, you've got a long life line, which is good, and the love line is strong ... ...  [Person2]:  What else do you see? Will I be successful? Will I make a lot of money?  [Person1]:  Hmm, hard to say, wait, yes, it looks like you will do well in business, and your ambition will help you a lot, but ... ...  [Person2]:  What? What is it? What's the matter?  [Person1]:  You seem to have a large gullibility line. You believe everything that you're told. 
[Person1]:  Do you like this house? [Person2]:  Yes, it's beautiful. [Person1]:  It's perfect for us and the kids. [Person2]:  3 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms and a big backyard. [Person1]:  And we can afford it! [Person2]:  So are we going to buy it? [Person1]:  I'm afraid not. [Person2]:  It's too far from your job, isn't it? [Person1]:  Yes, I can't spend 4 hours on the road every day. [Person2]:  By the time you get home you'll be too tired to even eat. [Person1]:  I won't be able to play with the kids! [Person2]:  No. We have to find someplace closer to your job.
[Person1]:  What a great ending to such a sad story! [Person2]:  Who wants that you're talking about? [Person1]:  I was just reading an article about some people who helped a homeless person in New York city. Well, the homeless person was a 33 year old man from an Eastern European country, he had come to the US in September, looking for work. Not only couldn't he find any but he also fell asleep at a bus station and was robbed of everything he owned. For about a month, the poor guy had to live in homeless shelters and beg for food. One day he met a group of people in a park. They were from a local clothing store that was giving away shirts and pants to homeless people. When they found out about the young man's problems, they immediately took him to a hotel. Gave him a hot meal and found a way to buy him a plane ticket back to his country.
[Person1]:  Hey, Joy. I like Jimi Hendrix more than the Beatles. [Person2]:  Jimi Hendrix was a great guitar player. But I think the Beatles were better than Hendrix. [Person1]:  Why do you think so? [Person2]:  They had great lyrics and great songs. It's a big band, Billy. [Person1]:  But I still love Hendrix more than the Beatles. [Person2]:  It seems that you are a big guitar fan, Billy.
[Person1]:  Did you clean your room today? [Person2]:  No, not yet. [Person1]:  Well, when were you planning on doing that? [Person2]:  I'm going to clean it up later. [Person1]:  Didn't I ask you to clean it up earlier? [Person2]:  I'm going to clean it. [Person1]:  I want you to vacuum in your room, and don't forget to dust everything. [Person2]:  I know. I'll do it. [Person1]:  Make sure you clean it up before you do anything else. [Person2]:  I'm not going anywhere until later, so I'll clean it then.
[Person1]:  This looks wonderful, Madame Culot. [Person2]:  Yes, it's very nice. All our foreign visitors enjoy it. The food is wonderfully well-prepared. Let me know if you need any help with the menu. [Person1]:  Thank you. Mmm. Can you tell me about the terrine? [Person2]:  Yes. A terrine is a kind of meat pate. It's meat turned into a paste. It sounds horrible but it's actually really good. [Person1]:  Mmm. Maybe another time. [Person2]:  You could try the ravioli. They are rather like your Chinese dumplings, and the sauce is delicious. [Person1]:  Sounds good. I think I'll have the lamb for my main course. What does it come with? [Person2]:  Well, you can have fries-French fries-or simple boiled potatoes. [Person1]:  I'll have the potatoes. What are you having? [Person2]:  I'm having my usual. I like the fish here. Would you like some wine? [Person1]:  Oh, yes. That would be lovely.
[Person1]:  We've managed to reduce our energy consumption in our factory by about 15 per cent in the last two years. [Person2]:  That's excellent. How have you managed that? [Person1]:  Mainly because we've invested in a heat recovery system. [Person2]:  What does that mean exactly? [Person1]:  Well, we use the exhaust gases from our printing presses to provide energy to heat our dryers. [Person2]:  What other sources of energy do you use? [Person1]:  We don't use any fossil fuels. Most of our power comes from hydro-electric plants. We're hoping to use even more energy from alternative sources in the future - perhaps even wind power.
[Person1]:  Hello, Madam. What can I do for you today? [Person2]:  Hello. Yes, I'm here to redeem a Treasury Note. It's not at the maturity date yet, but it is an emergency. [Person1]:  OK, can I see the note and some ID, please? [Person2]:  There you are. As you can see, the maturity isn't up yet. [Person1]:  You do realise that you must pay a 0. 2 % charge for premature cancellation, right? [Person2]:  Oh, really? No, I wasn't aware of that. [Person1]:  Unfortunately, yes. You see, this is a three-year note ; it was issued over a year ago, but not over two years. So, you will have to pay. I'm sorry about that.
[Person1]:  Give me your hand. ( takes Rose's hand ) Close your eyes. Go on. ( Rose closes her eyes ) Step up. Now hold on to the rail. Keep your eyes closed ; don't peek. [Person2]:  I'm not. [Person1]:  Step up onto the rail. Hold on. Keep your eyes closed. Trust me? [Person2]:  I trust you. [Person1]:  All right, open your eyes. ( Rose opens her eyes. She stretches her arms, and Jack stands behind her, arms around her. ) [Person2]:  I'm fling, Jack. ( singing ) Come, Josephine, in my flying machine. Up she goes, and up she goes. . .
[Person1]:  more and more Chinese are marrying foreigners. [Person2]:  that's true. But I have a low opinion of those women who go out with foreigners. [Person1]:  oh, why? [Person2]:  I think some Chinese wone marry foreigners for money while others just want to live abroad. There is no true love between them. [Person1]:  I wouldn't say that's totally true. I've met many happy intercultural couples. [Person2]:  well, then why aren't there many East-West couples where the man is a Chinese and the woman is a Westerner? [Person1]:  I guess it's because the Chinese women are more attractive to Western men. [Person2]:  or because they are less attractive to to Chinese men. [Person1]:  what do you mean? [Person2]:  you know, usually the woman is in her thirties and she is a left girl. [Person1]:  a left girl? What's that? [Person2]:  they're called that because they're left behind on the shelf. They're also known by their three H's---high diploma, high salary, and high degree. and they're also known as the three S's, single, [Person1]:  you have a point here, but I believe some mixed marriages are based on true love. [Person2]:  that'for sure but very few.
[Person1]:  Can you believe the headlines? [Person2]:  What are you reading? [Person1]:  I'm reading about Michael Milliken, the Bond King. [Person2]:  Didn't he sell worthless stocks to people or something? He got arrested for that, didn't he? [Person1]:  He got arrested all right. [Person2]:  If I remember, he got off with a light sentence. Something like three years in a minimum-security prison. [Person1]:  Yup, that's him. He made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless. [Person2]:  I think the government fined him a small amount, and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts. He's still a millionaire. [Person1]:  That's the kind of thing in America that gets me mad. Some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail. [Person2]:  I know. And some poor guy that robs a liquor store makes $ 500 at most and ends up in jail for five to ten years.
[Person1]:  Are you going to the cafeteria downstairs? [Person2]:  Yes. [Person1]:  Could you please get me a takeaway? I have some urgent work to finish. So I don't have enough time to go out for lunch. [Person2]:  No problem. What should I bring? [Person1]:  I am not picky on food. Just bring me the day menu.
[Person1]:  I have some photos here taken by myself. Would you like to see them? [Person2]:  Sure. Speaking of photos, what type of film will be the best? You know, I'm planning a tour to Jiuzhaigou Valley. [Person1]:  I would get Fuji 200 film for taking photos of natural beauty. [Person2]:  Thank you so much. You're an expert.

This is our most popular choice, our river guides will take you on a whitewater rafting trip followed by a ride in a hot air balloon! [Person2]:  I don't really think I'm ready to throw myself down a river full of jagged rocks in a rubber boat or go up in the air in a wicker basket held up by an oversize balloon. What else do you have? [Person1]:  Well, in that case, we can take you hang gliding with one of our experienced instructors. It's the closest you can get to flying. [Person2]:  What? You mean strap myself to a flimsy kite? No, thank you! Next! [Person1]:  Mmm. OK. Well, why don't you tell me a little bit more about what you would like? We have everything from mountain biking, to rock climbing to street luge. [Person2]:  I'm thinking something exciting but. safer.

There are 3 ways you can do this, firstly you can send the money account to account, or you can choose to send cash to account or you can send cash to individual. Which service would you like? [Person2]:  I think account to individual would be best. But which is the quickest way? [Person1]:  If you choose our Urgent Remittance Service the money can be there within 2 hours. There will be a 1 % handling fee and then you need to pay 12 RMB for the Express Delivery Service. [Person2]:  Right, that's fine. I'd like it to get there as quickly as possible.

It may suit my furniture. How much do you ask for it? [Person1]:  360 yuan. [Person2]:  Show it to me, Please. Can you get me another? It's scratched a little bit here. [Person1]:  Sorry, sir. This is the last one we have in stock. [Person2]:  I do like it. Can you come down a bit? [Person1]:  I can give you a 10 % discount. [Person2]:  That's still too much. Can you lower the price further? [Person1]:  I'm afraid that's the best we can do. [Person2]:  If so, I'd better try another store.
[Person1]:  Mumm. Those burgers smell great. It's perfect day for a barbecue. [Person2]:  It sure is. I'm glad it didn't rain. My name's Mike Gates, by the way. [Person1]:  Oh, hi! I'm Barbara Johnson. Nice to meet you. [Person2]:  I'm sorry. What's your name again? [Person1]:  Barbara. But please, just call me Barb. [Person2]:  So Barb. . . what do you do? [Person1]:  I'm studying medicine. [Person2]:  Really? Where? [Person1]:  At Harvard. What about you? [Person2]:  I'm an engineer at IBM. [Person1]:  Oh, are you? That sounds interesting. [Person2]:  Yeah. I like it. Hey, it looks like the food is ready. [Person1]:  Good. I'm starving.
[Person1]:  Last month, we only had 40 hits on our site. Our products and prices are good, but the problem is that no one knows about our website. [Person2]:  If we want to get this internet business off the ground, we've got to do something fast. [Person1]:  We need to maximize the chances that our site will be at the top of search engine lists, but I'm not sure how to do it. [Person2]:  We've got to put more buzz words into the page text, so it will pop up when people search about our kind of products. [Person1]:  Yeah, you're right. We've got to get the most popular phrases there. . . How else can we boost site traffic? [Person2]:  I think one of the least costly ways to attract business is to ask some of our neighboring sites to offer links to our page inside of theirs. If they have related services, they may be willing to help us out. [Person1]:  I guess we could also put out a few advertisements for our website inside of the search engine. I would like to find the most effective way to let people know about our site and our products.
[Person1]:  How do I know when to tell EDD that have I started a new job? [Person2]:  Work is work, whether it's a part-time or temporary job or a full-time gig. [Person1]:  So I guess I have to report that I'Ve found a little bit of work. [Person2]:  All you need to do is fill in the blanks correctly on the Continued Claim Form, and the EDD Office will take care of the rest. [Person1]:  What about if I find a job that I know will only last for a couple of weeks? Can I take it? [Person2]:  It is to your advantage to work as much as you can.
[Person1]:  Does Tom drink a lot? [Person2]:  Yes, he does. He of ten has had one to many. But I advised him not to drink too much, he just boasted that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table. [Person1]:  That's a problem. He has sort of Dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything.
[Person1]:  Do you have any seat preference, madam? [Person2]:  Yes, could you please put me in the non-smoking section? [Person1]:  Would you like a window seat? [Person2]:  Yes, if any one is available. But not over the wing. [Person1]:  I am sorry, there is no window seat in the non-smoking room. [Person2]:  It doesn't matter, I will take an aisle seat.
[Person1]:  This one looks great! I love the seashore. [Person2]:  So do I. The sun. . . the sand. . . the ocean! [Person1]:  And listen to this! What do you think of sailing, swimming, windsurfing, and fishing? [Person2]:  Oh, Tom! They sound fantastic. I really like all those things. [Person1]:  Yeah. . . me, too. [Person2]:  Well, except fishing. To be honest, I hate fishing, but I love all the others. [Person1]:  Hey! Look at this! We can stay in a big hotel or we can stay in a little cabin by the beach. [Person2]:  You know. I really don't those big hotels. [Person1]:  Neither do I. Let's stay in a cabin. It'll be much nicer right beside the ocean.
[Person1]:  May I have your order now?  [Person2]:  We'd have your regular dinner. What courses are there, please?  [Person1]:  The courses for our regular dinner are fish salad for appetizer, steak for main course and chocolate cake for dessert. [Person2]:  All right, we'll have it.  [Person1]:  Today's mutton chop is very good. Would you like to have it as the main course? [Person2]:  That's a good idea. And as for dessert, we'll have apple pie. We'd like to have some coffee afterwards.  [Person1]:  Good, here're your appetizers. Your dinners will be ready in five minutes. 
[Person1]:  Hey Phil [Person2]:  Yes, and what an experience. [Person1]:  What do you mean? [Person2]:  Well, it's nothing like visiting a swimming pool in the States. [Person1]:  Well, what do you do when you go to a public bath? [Person2]:  First, you take off your shoes before you enter. [Person1]:  Okay. [Person2]:  Then, you pay an entrance fee to the man or woman at the front counter. [Um-huh]. Next, you get undressed in the dressing room. And I was very surprised ... and a little embarrassed to see that the woman who took my money was sitting on a platform where she had a clear view of the men's side of the dressing room. [Really?] This allows the workers to keep an eye on the patrons' belongings while they are in the bath. [Person1]:  Wow. And do you wear a bathing suit or something? [Person2]:  Oh no! You don't wear anything. Then you go into the main bathing area and wash your body while sitting on a small stool about 40 centimeters high. [Person1]:  On a stool!? [Person2]:  Yeah. It was really hard getting used to bathing in that position. Sometimes, even, people wash each other's backs. [Person1]:  Oh really. So, what do you do after that? [Person2]:  Well, after you've rinsed off all the soap, they usually have two or three large baths where you can soak for a while. [Person1]:  Do you actually share the bath with other people? [Person2]:  Yeah. Traditionally, the bath played an important role in the community. It gave neighbors an opportunity to socialize while bathing. [Person1]:  Huh. Interesting. [Person2]:  When you're all done bathing, people relax in the dressing room by watching TV, drinking tea or juice, or talking to friends. It's quite an experience.
[Person1]:  Hey, what's new?  [Person2]:  Not much. Just sitting here eating some Chinese food. Is that the paper? Why don't you open it and tell me my horoscope?  [Person1]:  Ok, wait a minute ... let's see. I'm a Taurus, and it says, Mars is in the third house, and is soon to eclipse Venus. I don't know what that means, but then it says, Your charm and drive will win others over to your way of thinking. Remember to be positive. Sounds good to me.  [Person2]:  What about Gemini? What's the prediction?  [Person1]:  Since Mercury has crossed paths with Jupiter, your fortunes are falling. Bad luck will follow you today, and you will lose that which you value. Be careful.  [Person2]:  That sounds bad! I'm really worried, what should I do? Maybe I should go home and stay in the rest of the day.  [Person1]:  But we have a date tonight! You can't stay at home because of a stupid horoscope. 
[Person1]:  Your garden is looking very beautiful this summer. The flowers are really colorful.  [Person2]:  Thank you. I have roses, tulips, and daffodils. Do you like the rockery with the smaller flowers?  [Person1]:  Yes, I do. Those are violets, aren't they?  [Person2]:  Yes, they are. This afternoon, I'm going to prune the hedge.  [Person1]:  The lower branches on that tree are hanging very low. Would you like me to cut them off for you?  [Person2]:  Thank you! That would be very kind of you. I have a saw in the garden shed.  [Person1]:  When the lower branches are removed, you'll be able to sit under the tree.  [Person2]:  Tomorrow, I'll cut the grass. Then the garden will look perfect.  [Person1]:  Just make sure children don't play in the flower beds and destroy the flowers. 
[Person1]:  Sofia, I've just confirmed our flight online and it looks like will be delayed by an hour. The flight is now scheduled to leave at 4 [Person2]:  Then we're in trouble. We won't be able to get to Chicago by 6 [Person1]:  Don't worry. I'll talk to him. I'm going to call him to speak about our report. [Person2]:  Don't forget to apologize to him about being late.
[Person1]:  Hi, Bill. Are you going to the commencement? [Person2]:  Yes. Do you want to go with me? [Person1]:  OK. ( Several minutes later. ) Let's go into the school auditorium. [Person2]:  Now that take this seat. Do you see those piles of red diplomas on the desks on the stage? [Person1]:  Yes. I find my heart is now rising and falling like waves, all sorts of feelings welling up in my heart. [Person2]:  That's true. Four years'trails and hardships, joys and sorrows of life are gushing out to my mind all together. I can hardly tell whether I am joyful or gloomy at the moment when I am about to leave the campus and to start a new stage of my life. [Person1]:  How time flies. Look, the president of the college has come onto the stage. [Person2]:  He's going to make the opening speech.
[Person1]:  Ah, Vera, it's great that you've come with me during our lunch break to do some shopping. I need to buy a suit to go to a wedding. And I have to look very smart. [Person2]:  I will make sure of that, Rob. Everybody says I have good taste. I've always chosen my husband's and my son's clothes. Rob, I love that gray suit in the window. [Person1]:  Wow, it looks really smart actually. But I like black best. [Person2]:  Well, you can try it first.
[Person1]:  Miss, would you like to try this free sample of our new suntan cream? [Person2]:  Sure, why not? [Person1]:  This is a new product of company this year. It's oil-free. [Person2]:  I see. It feels very light on the skin. [Person1]:  It gives your skin a very natural healthy look. [Person2]:  I like the cool smell, too.
[Person1]:  Do you believe in horoscope fortune-telling? [Person2]:  I used to be an atheist. But in recent months, I couldn't but form a more favorable opinion of horoscope. [Person1]:  That sounds interesting. Have you been involved in any mystery? [Person2]:  Not exactly, except that I find horoscope predictions increasingly accurate. I came upon a website which sends me an up-dated message by e-mail each day forecasting my experience in detail. It is amazing to find these forecasts largely in line with my daily life. [Person1]:  What did it say about you then? [Person2]:  For example, the message for the day before yesterday notified me that I, as a Leo guy, was to have some ' unusual experience in food and drink. And as it turned out, the reality matched this prediction well. Lasi night, I was treated to a dinner party by Mr. Lee. [Person1]:  But it must have been only a coincidence. That's the only way superstition wins over science. [Person2]:  Oh, no. You can never tell whether such-and-such is science or sheer fraud. If horoscope is really something deceptive, how come quite a size of proportion of young people think highly of it. [Person1]:  For fun. It serves as a shared topic to them. While they claim to consult the predictions constantly and marvel at their ' accuracy'. they do not necessarily take them seriously. When it that these predictions are matched by their real-life experiences, they delight in spreading the thrill with friends. But if there isn't any correlation between reality and predictions, they just grin, forget about them, and go on living as usual.
[Person1]:  Yesterday was April the first. [Person2]:  Was it quite special? [Person1]:  Not for the others, but for me. I was in the library going over my lessons when suddenly one of my roommates came in. He told me that I was wanted on the phone in my dormitory, and that person would call me again several minutes later. [Person2]:  Did you hurry back to the bedroom? [Person1]:  Yes. I went back to the dorm only to find my roommates laughing and shouting ' April Fool, April Fool '. [Person2]:  Oh, your classmates took you in. [Person1]:  Only then did I realize it was April Fools' Day.
[Person1]:  I just received a phone call for an interview next week. [Person2]:  Congratulations! This is your first interview ever. [Person1]:  thank you, but I'm nervous. I don't know what to do. Could you tell me what should I do before an interview? [Person2]:  sure, you should prepare so that you can give proper response when you're being interviewed. [Person1]:  yeah, besides my personal introduction, what else should I prepare? [Person2]:  you should collect as much information about the company and the position you're applying for as you can. It is important to show that you've done some research into the company. The interviewers will be pleased if they find you know the company well. [Person1]:  then what should I do when I'm being interviewed? [Person2]:  smile at the interviewers and look them in their eyes while trying to persuade them to select you. Try to act natural, let your personality, ability and interpersonal skills shine through the interview [Person1]:  are there any other things I should pay attention to? [Person2]:  yeah, wear formal clothes to your interview and do be punctual. That'll leave your interviewers with a good first impression.
[Person1]:  Good morning. How are you? [Person2]:  I'm very worried, doctor [Person1]:  Oh? What are you worried about? [Person2]:  I'm afraid that I'm very ill. [Person1]:  I'm sorry to hear that. Why do you think so? [Person2]:  Because I feel tired all the time, even when I wake up in the morning. I find very difficult to do any work. I have no appetite. My wife cooks me delicious meals but I can only eat a little. [Person1]:  How do you sleep? [Person2]:  Very badly, doctor. [Person1]:  Do you find it difficult to get to sleep, or do you wake up early? [Person2]:  Both, doctor. I never get to sleep until two o'clock and I always wake up at five. [Person1]:  Are you worried about anything? [Person2]:  Well, yes, I am. I'm worried about my work. I've just taken a new job. I earn a lot of money but it's difficult work. I'm always afraid of making a mistake. [Person1]:  I see. please take off your shirt and lie down on the couch. [Person2]:  Yes, doctor. ( The doctor examines the patient ) [Person1]:  Well, there's nothing very much wrong with you, I'm glad to say. You're working too hard and worrying too much. Do you take much exercise? [Person2]:  No, doctor. I never have enough time for exercise. I start work very early in the morning and finish late in the evening. Then I can't get to sleep. Can you give me some medicine to help me to sleep? [Person1]:  I can, but I'm not going to. You don't need medicine. You need advice. Don't work so hard. Too much work is bad for you. Don't worry about your work. It's silly to worry. Take regular exercise. [Person2]:  But I may lose my job, doctor! It's hard to get a job like mine. [Person1]:  Then get an easier one, even if you earn less money. Which would you rather have, health or wealth? [Person2]:  You're right, doctor. It's more important to be healthy than wealthy. I'll change my job. I'm grateful for your advice. [Person1]:  Come and see me again in a month's time. I think you'll be a different man!
[Person1]:  Do you want to practice your driving right now? [Person2]:  No problem. We can do it right now. [Person1]:  Are you buckled up? [Person2]:  All right. Now what do I do? [Person1]:  Start the car. [Person2]:  Which way do you want me to go? [Person1]:  Take a left. [Person2]:  How far do you want me to go? [Person1]:  I'll tell you when to stop. [Person2]:  Just make sure to tell me beforehand. [Person1]:  We're back now, so why don't you try parking? [Person2]:  Well, that was fun. Let's do it again soon.
[Person1]:  John, I was talking to the travel agent about where we might be taking our vacation this year. [Person2]:  I am going fishing in Alaska with my friend, Mark. [Person1]:  What are you talking about? [Person2]:  What's wrong with heading out with Mark for vacation? [Person1]:  You and I have been together for a whole year, and our vacation time should be about the two of us! [Person2]:  Really? Who made that rule up? [Person1]:  With that attitude, I don't really think we have much more to discuss here. [Person2]:  That works for me!
[Person1]:  I'm going to need a taxi. [Person2]:  You don't have to restrict yourself to a taxi. We can offer you a private vehicle. [Person1]:  A private vehicle, huh? No, a taxi is okay. [Person2]:  Some people find a limo to be much more comfortable than a taxi. [Person1]:  No, I wouldn't be caught dead in a limo. [Person2]:  No upgrade of any kind. And where might you be going? [Person1]:  I'm headed to Rockefeller Center. [Person2]:  When shall I tell the taxi to be here? [Person1]:  Right now. [Person2]:  The taxi will be here immediately, sir. [Person1]:  Good, I'm leaving my room in about one minute. [Person2]:  You won't have to wait a second, sir.
[Person1]:  Did you hear something? [Person2]:  Oh, it is my cell phone ringing. I set it in the vibration mode. [Person1]:  It is a good habit to set your cell phone to vibrate. It is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices. [Person2]:  You are right. Some ring tone is just terribly loud. You can hear it even in the next door. It is really a kind of distraction. [Person1]:  Maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done. [Person2]:  Good idea.
[Person1]:  You look worried, Mary. What can I do for you? [Person2]:  I've lost my shoulder bag, John. [Person1]:  Are you sure you've searched everywhere? [Person2]:  Yes, I can't find it anywhere. [Person1]:  Can you tell me something about it? [Person2]:  Yes. It's brown leather and it has a button on the front. [Person1]:  What was in it? [Person2]:  My wallet with twenty pounds in it, er ...some keys, and an English dictionary. [Person1]:  When did you last have it? [Person2]:  I had it with me at lunch time in the restaurant. I hung it on the side of my chair while I was eating. [Person1]:  When did you find it was missing? [Person2]:  After lunch, I was going to buy something but I couldn't find my bag. I realized I had left it in the restaurant. I went back to get it, but it wasn't there on the chair.
[Person1]:  A lovely day, isn't it? [Person2]:  It is. [Person1]:  It seems it will be fine all day. [Person2]:  I think it will be a dry day. There's hardly a cloud in the sky. [Person1]:  We'll have a heat wave in the afternoon. I'm afraid. [Person2]:  It's very hot today. No wind at all. [Person1]:  You're fight. There's hardly a breath of air. [Person2]:  By the way, did you watch the weather forecast on the television? [Person1]:  Yes, it is said a high pressure area would remain to the southwest of England. There would be a little rain or showers here or there, but bright weather the rest of the day.
[Person1]:  Hi! Can I help you? [Person2]:  Hi! Have you got any records of modern guitar music? [Person1]:  We've got a lot of them. Which one are you looking for? [Person2]:  I'm looking for some records of Julian Bream. I saw them in your window last week and I had them before in Canada, but I broke them. [Person1]:  What happened? [Person2]:  They were in my bag. I sat on my bag and broke the records. My sister told me about your shop. I came here last week and saw the records. [Person1]:  Let's look for the records. Oh, yes, the records are there on the shelf. [Person2]:  How much are those three? [Person1]:  They are four pounds and fifty pence. [Person2]:  Here is five pounds.
[Person1]:  I'm glad we came here. This is really delicious!  [Person2]:  I was worried you would think it was too far to drive.  [Person1]:  Well, it's true I've never driven two hours just to get lunch. But really, I think it's worth it.  [Person2]:  I think if you try some more authentic Chinese food, you might understand how we students from Taiwan suffer.  [Person1]:  How do you mean 'suffer'?  [Person2]:  I mean, in Milwaukee there is no good Chinese food. So we miss the food in Taiwan too much. Sometimes we just have to drive down here to Chicago to find something better.  [Person1]:  Even in the winter?  [Person2]:  Yes, even in the winter.  [Person1]:  And even if it takes two hours, huh?  [Person2]:  Why not? I've been craving good food for three weeks now. I'm too sick of hamburgers and pizza!  [Person1]:  Well, this really is delicious, I have to admit. I can understand better now why you and your friends are always whining.  [Person2]:  Don't tease me! Good food is really important to Chinese!  [Person1]:  I know. I can see that. This is what is called 'dim sum, ' right?  [Person2]:  Yes, all these dishes are different 'dim sum' dishes. You can't find this kind of thing except for in a few cities in America.  [Person1]:  So when you Chinese think of Chinatown, you mostly think of food. Is that right?  [Person2]:  Of course. I will try to buy some things at the Asian grocery down the block too. Then I can do a little cooking in my apartment.  [Person1]:  And maybe we can go to a good Italian restaurant for dinner, after the museum. Chicago has some great Italian restaurants.  [Person2]:  No way!  [Person1]:  What do you mean?  [Person2]:  We're going up to the 'new' Chinatown for dinner. I already know where we're going to go.  [Person1]:  Alright, alright. I am happy to try more Chinese food. Will it be dim sum again?  [Person2]:  No, dim sum is usually eaten around lunch time, or sometimes closer to breakfast. We'll try more Taiwanese style up at the 'new' Chinatown.  [Person1]:  Taiwanese style? Isn't dim sum Taiwanese style?  [Person2]:  No, dim sum is more Cantonese style. But of course you can buy it in Taiwan.  [Person1]:  I wonder if you can cook things this good.  [Person2]:  I'm a great cook actually. You will see. 
[Person1]:  I can't seem to progress up the career ladder no matter how hard I try and I have been here for 2 years already!  [Person2]:  Well, have you thought of getting an MBA? I heard it does wonders in getting you to the top.  [Person1]:  An MBA, hey. . . well my degree wasn't in business, the business schools won't be interested in me.  [Person2]:  Nonsense! The business schools measure your ability through a test called GMAT.  [Person1]:  GMAT? What does that stand for and what will the test contain?  [Person2]:  Graduate Management Admission Test, it contains three parts  [Person1]:  Okay, this sounds a little tough, how am I supposed to practice for this?  [Person2]:  Up to you, you could have a one on one session with a tutor or group sessions, you can also use free or private computer software. Going to church might help as well!  [Person1]:  No matter what I do, I'm going to ace this test and go on to become a corporate fat cat!  [Person2]:  Umm. . . That's the spirit! 
[Person1]:  When you smell them, they affect your nervous system.  [Person2]:  I thought you were supposed to put them in some kind of burner with a candle. . .  [Person1]:  You can do that, too. Both methods have a healing effect.  [Person2]:  So what's your illness. . . shopping fever, sale-itis?  [Person1]:  Ha-ha. . . I'm just fatigued. And tomorrow is a big day.  [Person2]:  What's tomorrow?  [Person1]:  More sales! 
[Person1]:  Did you lock the doors?  [Person2]:  All except the back door. I left that open for Tim. He took the dog for a walk.  [Person1]:  Well, I'm going on to bed. I' m beat.  [Person2]:  Ok, I'm going to stay up awhile. I've got to go over the household budget , We 're a little over-spend this month.  [Person1]:  Please told Tim to close the door to the basement. I don't want dog down there tonight.  [Person2]:  Ok, Good night , see you at breakfast. 
[Person1]:  Waiter! May I see you for while?  [Person2]:  Yes. I'll be with you in a second. Yes, sir? What is the problem?  [Person1]:  This is not what I asked for, I'm afraid.  [Person2]:  What did you order?  [Person1]:  Roast beef.  [Person2]:  There must be a mistake. Those are fried oysters. Would you like to keep it or change?  [Person1]:  Roast beef, of course. That's what I ordered.  [Person2]:  Just a moment and I'll get your order right away. Sorry to cause the inconvenience. 
[Person1]:  Good afternoon doctor. [Person2]:  Good afternoon, Mrs. Brown. Wow, what's wrong with this little boy? [Person1]:  He is my son Jim. He's gotta cough. [Person2]:  How long has he been like this? [Person1]:  Ever since last night. [Person2]:  Has he had anything to eat today? [Person1]:  Yes, he had a little milk and an egg this morning. [Person2]:  Well, Mrs. Brown. I think he's caught a cold. [Person1]:  Is it serious? [Person2]:  No, it's nothing serious, but he better stay at home and rest. [Person1]:  Thank you very much. [Person2]:  You're welcome.
[Person1]:  Hi, I'm Mike. I just moved in next door. [Person2]:  Oh hi, come on in. I'm Barbara. Would you like something to drink? [Person1]:  Thanks, some tea would be nice. I really like your tea set. Where did you get it? [Person2]:  Oh, there is a supermarket not far from here. I bought it on sale. But there is also a teahouse around the corner. [Person1]:  It's a nice neighborhood here. [Person2]:  Yeah, you can get to the bus and the underground train stations within 10 minute's walk. There's a bookstore, a gym and many restaurants along the street. [Person1]:  There's a gym nearby? I really want to go to a gym as soon as possible. [Person2]:  Well. If you want, we can go together sometime. Actually I was thinking of going this afternoon. If you like, you can join me. [Person1]:  That would be wonderful.
[Person1]:  Look, how grand magnificent the Tiananmen Gate tour is! [Person2]:  What's Tiananmen famous for? [Person1]:  It is largest pop square in the world. you see that is monument for the people's hero, and the Chairman Mao memorial hall on the south. there is great hall of the people on the west. there are two museums on the east. [Person2]:  What's that? [Person1]:  That's the Forbidden city on the north of Gate building. [Person2]:  All the sightseeing in china is very attractive and crescive. travelling to China is very worth one. thank you so much for your guides, and I'll miss you.
[Person1]:  For the 100th anniversary of the opening of the library we are going to have a party. [Person2]:  That's a wonderful way to celebrate this grand old library! [Person1]:  I hoped you would be willing to brainstorm with me for party ideas. [Person2]:  That is right up my alley. You say party and I'm there. [Person1]:  Perfect. It will be open to the public and we anticipate roughly about five to seven hundred people. [Person2]:  Will it be an all day event? [Person1]:  Yes. And we checked with the city and we have permission to use the park adjacent to the library. [Person2]:  That was quick thinking.
[Person1]:  Hello, Madam. Are you alright? [Person2]:  I'm here to pay my telephone bill. I usually go to the post office, but I was told that I could take care of it here. Is that right? [Person1]:  Yes, that's correct, Madam. You don't need to go to a counter at all, you can use one of our ATM machines. I'll be more than happy to help you. [Person2]:  I don't usually like to use Atms, I like dealing with a real person, you see. [Person1]:  I know it does seem a little daunting, but once you get used to it, it will save you a lot of time and trouble.
[Person1]:  Look, Bob. This is a photograph I took during my trip to Australia. [Person2]:  Let me see it, can I? This is a good photograph. Who are these people? [Person1]:  They're people I met during the trip. That's the ship we traveled on. [Person2]:  What a beautiful ship! Who's this? [Person1]:  That's the man I told you about. Remember? [Person2]:  Ah yes. The one who offered you a job in Australia. [Person1]:  That's right. [Person2]:  Who's this? [Person1]:  Guess! [Person2]:  It's not you, is it? [Person1]:  That's right. I grew a beard during the trip, but I shaved it off when I came home. [Person2]:  Why did you shave it off? [Person1]:  My wife didn't like it!
[Person1]:  I am not sure what to do during the holidays, any suggestions? [Person2]:  Well, going to a cinema, visiting the galleries, exhibitions and museums, finding and meeting old friends, exercising in the health club or mountain biking. There are so many good choices. [Person1]:  The problem is that I find all of them are full of fun. I just don't know what to do first. [Person2]:  Why not start with the most interesting one? [Person1]:  Actually, I'm interested in all of them. The more choices we have, the harder to make a decision. [Person2]:  Toss a coin to decide then.
[Person1]:  What's the matter with you then? You look miserable. [Person2]:  It's us. [Person1]:  What do you mean by us. [Person2]:  Well, you always say you're busy. [Person1]:  That's right. [Person2]:  And you often go back to live with your parents and leave our son in the room by himself. [Person1]:  I. . . I. . . I miss my parents, also they miss me. [Person2]:  Oh I remember, I cut terrible calls, and you didn't say anything about it. [Person1]:  You mean I am groaned a few words? [Person2]:  Totally not. Perhaps it's about our marriage.
[Person1]:  I'm so hungry! Can you buy me a burrito? [Person2]:  I don't have any money to buy you a burrito. [Person1]:  Please? I haven't eaten anything all day. [Person2]:  Look, I only have money to buy myself a burrito. [Person1]:  I'm so hungry, I could eat a whole cow! [Person2]:  If you're so hungry, why don't you ask someone else for money? [Person1]:  I get paid on Friday, I'll pay you back then. [Person2]:  Well, I guess on Friday, then you can eat. [Person1]:  That's pretty messed up. [Person2]:  Why don't you just go home and eat? [Person1]:  I don't want to go all the way home just to eat. [Person2]:  Well, I guess you're out of luck.
[Person1]:  Hi Colin. How are you feeling today? [Person2]:  Oh, I feel ok but I'm still very tired. [Person1]:  It's probably jet lag. [Person2]:  I think so. One minute I feel quite awake, and the next I feel very tired. [Person1]:  Do you want to visit any tourist spots in the city? [Person2]:  Oh yes, I'm very interested in Chinese history so I'd like to visit the Summer Palace. [Person1]:  Good idea. I'd be very happy to go there.
[Person1]:  What did you cook? [Person2]:  Well, as you know I was in Thailand last month, and I took a cooking class! So I prepared some of my favorite dishes. [Person1]:  Great idea! As long as I don't get food poisoning! So what is on the menu tonight? [Person2]:  Ok, for starters we have Tom Yam soup. It's a bit spicy, but really good! [Person1]:  This is delicious! The ginger and lemongrass really gives it a nice taste! [Person2]:  Now this next dish is one of the most famous. Foreigners call it papaya salad but the proper name is Tom Sam. It is a spicy salad made from a mix of fresh vegetables including shredded unripened papaya and tomato. [Person1]:  This is delicious! The combination of sour and spicy is really interesting! I could have this everyday! [Person2]:  Ok, now for the last and best dish in my opinion. This is called Pad Thai. It's stir-fried noodles with eggs, fish sauce, tamarind juice, red chili pepper plus bean sprouts, shrimp and tofu and garnished with crushed peanuts and coriander. It's practically Thailand's national dish! [Person1]:  Wow, this is great! I never knew Thai food was so creative and delicious! [Person2]:  Want some more? [Person1]:  I'm stuffed!
[Person1]:  I'm thirsty. Pull over to that store, I'll buy some drinks. [Person2]:  I'm afraid I can't. Parking is not allowed here. [Person1]:  Oh, that's too bad, Where can you park around here? [Person2]:  There is a square in front of us. We can park the car there. [Person1]:  Is a shop there? [Person2]:  I'm not sure, you know I'm not familiar with the city, too.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, Don? I hate to bother you, but I need your help on something. Do you have time to brief me on the Martin account today? [Person2]:  Oh, that's right. You are supposed to deliver a brief on that account tomorrow. I know there are some things I need to share with you about that. But, gosh, I don't know. . . Things are really busy for me today, the only time I can manage to squeeze out might be over lunch break. . . [Person1]:  I hate to make you work through your lunch break with how busy you are. . . [Person2]:  It's okay. . . I've already had several days in a row working through lunch. . . [Person1]:  How about this. . . We can make it a working lunch this afternoon, and I'll order some Chinese food for delivery. It'll be my treat. [Person2]:  You don't have to do that. . . [Person1]:  I insist. I really appreciate you taking time to work with me in. What is your favorite fast food? I'll cater to your taste. [Person2]:  Actually I do like Chinese. . . Let's make it a date for Chop Suey and the Martin account at about twelve thirty. Does that sound good? [Person1]:  Great. I'll bring the food.
[Person1]:  I can't seem to find the cereal aisle. [Person2]:  You'll find the cereal by the breakfast foods. [Person1]:  What breakfast foods? [Person2]:  They're over by the oatmeal and the breakfast bars. [Person1]:  Oh, I think I know what you're talking about. [Person2]:  Can I help you with anything else? [Person1]:  Could you tell me where the dishwashing detergent is? [Person2]:  You'll find that by the paper towels. [Person1]:  Oh, I didn't think of that. [Person2]:  That's where it'll be. [Person1]:  Well, thank you very much. [Person2]:  If you need anything else, please feel free to ask me
[Person1]:  in China at least, coffee is often associated with an exotic, well-to-do bourgeois lifestyle. Coffee is often considered a hobby of the well-educated, middle-class people. [Person2]:  maybe that's why some young chaps often spend a whole afternoon in a coffee bar, surfing the net or just typewriting something with laptop. While they are savoring a coffee at a leisured pace, they think they are actually living a western bourgeois lifestyle. [Person1]:  yes. Behind a lifestyle, there is a culture. Young people easily become blind worshippers of a Westernized life. While they may not really like coffee, they think it desirable and enviable to be lavish. [Person2]:  then what about tea? We need to bear in mind in the first place that tea, rather than coffee, has been the most popular drink for the Chinese people. [Person1]:  well. Tea represents another facet of popular culture. While a coffee bar is usually quiet and resonates with soft, elegant music, a teahouse is often a noisy, crowded, public space. Now there are not as many young people visit teahouses as before. And those fancy and modern teahouses are designed for business talk, which are too expensive for ordinary people. [Person2]:  what a pity that the traditional teahouses, as depicted Lao She, keep fading away so quickly in this metropolis. It is not easy to find an old-fashioned teahouse that suits the ordinary people's spend [Person1]:  well, that's true. In a sense, it is not so much what you drink that really counts, as where and how you drink.
[Person1]:  How do I set up an E-mail account? [Person2]:  Oh, that's easy. Go to www. onxiu. cn. Now, click on the link with the picture of an envelope. [Person1]:  Which link? [Person2]:  That one, the one that says Mail. [Person1]:  Oh, no. What did I do? It's asking me for a password. [Person2]:  Don't worry. See where it says, New User? [Person1]:  Yes. [Person2]:  Click on that. [Person1]:  Oh, I see. [Person2]:  Yeah, just fill out this form and choose a password. The computer will do the rest.
[Person1]:  How can I help you? [Person2]:  I'd like to return this sweater. I bought it a week ago. [Person1]:  Well, first of all, what seems to be the problem? [Person2]:  Well, isn't it obvious by just looking at it? The first time I washed and dried it, the thing shrank at least five sizes. [Person1]:  Uh, I see what you mean, but did you follow the washing instructions? [Person2]:  How was I supposed to know that? The label is written in Spanish! And the color faded from a nice dark blue to a light green. [Person1]:  Sir, we take a lot of pride in our clothing. What I can do is allow you to exchange the sweater for another one. [Person2]:  But I just want my money back! [Person1]:  Sorry. Since the item you bought was on clearance, we can't give back your money. [Person2]:  A clearance item! Was I supposed to know that? [Person1]:  I guess you didn't read the fine print in our ad. Look. Here's the ad, and the information about the clearance sale is right here. [Person2]:  OK. I'll exchange it for another one. But you should give credit for your goods next time.
[Person1]:  What does the term 'alternative energy source' mean? [Person2]:  When we think of energy or fuel for our homes and cars, we think of petroleum, a fossil fuel processed from oil removed from the ground, of which there is a limited supply. But alternative fuels can be many things. Wind, sun and water can all be used to create fuel. [Person1]:  Is the threat of running out of petroleum real? [Person2]:  It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time. The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use. Most experts agree that by around 2025, the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak. Then production and availability will begin to seriously decline. This is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point. But it'll become very difficult and therefore expensive to extract. [Person1]:  Is that the most important reason to develop alternative fuel and energy sources? [Person2]:  There are two very clear reasons to do so. One is that whether we have 60 or 600 years of fossil fuels left, we have to find other fuel sources eventually. So the sooner we start, the better off we will be. The other big argument is that when we use fossil fuels for a long time, which leads to some long-term negative effects, like global warming and the greenhouse effect, there could be extinctions of many creatures, such as polarbears. It will be human beings that pay the price.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, I'm a reporter from China Daily. I'd like to know what types of newspaper people often read. Would you mind answering a few questions? [Person2]:  No, not at all. [Person1]:  Can you tell me where you're from, please? [Person2]:  Er, I was born in Japan and grew up in Italy. [Person1]:  Oh, sounds interesting. Are you used to living here, in New York city? [Person2]:  Very much so. I've been working in a college for three years. [Person1]:  Woo, a college teacher. And when do you normally read newspapers? [Person2]:  Well, I'm busy during the day, so usually after 8 [Person1]:  What sections do you prefer? [Person2]:  I'm mainly interested in the shopping. Other than that, I also like the news.
[Person1]:  So you're visiting San Francisco? [Person2]:  Yes, I just got here yesterday. And you? [Person1]:  I'm a native. [Person2]:  Oh, really? Everyone else I've met so far has been a tourist like us. I was beginning to think that there were no natives. [Person1]:  Well. San Francisco has a lot of different ethnic groups so you might think you're seeing a lot of foreigners. But actually, the city has a population of about 700 000. [Person2]:  What are the different ethnic groups? [Person1]:  Web, after whites, the largest one is blacks. [Person2]:  I thought it was Chinese. [Person1]:  It's true that San Francisco has the largest Chinese community outside of Asia. But there are many more blacks here than Chinese. [Person2]:  That's interesting. Don't most of the Chinese people live in China-town? [Person1]:  Well, no, they live all over the city, but China-town is definitely the center of Chinese culture here. That's where you'll find the best Chinese restaurants, bookstores, art, theaters, things like that. [Person2]:  What about the Japanese? Doesn't San Francisco have a large Japanese population too? [Person1]:  No, actually there are only about 12 000 Japanese people here, but we do have an area called 'Japan-town' that has Japanese restaurants and bookstores. [Person2]:  You seem to know a lot about this city. [Person1]:  Well, most San Franciscans think their city is pretty special. We like to talk about it. Besides, I teach ethnic history at the university here. [Person2]:  No wonder you know so much!
[Person1]:  Good evening, sir. Welcome to our restaurant.  [Person2]:  Thank you.  [Person1]:  Do you have a reservation?  [Person2]:  Yes, I do.  [Person1]:  May I have your name, please?  [Person2]:  Yes, it's Mr. Brown.  [Person1]:  Mr. Brown. We were expecting you. This way, please. Will this table be fine?  [Person2]:  Oh, this is just fine.  [Person1]:  Please take a seat.  [Person2]:  Thank you.  [Person1]:  Here is the menu. 
[Person1]:  Ivy, how do you like your new apartment? [Person2]:  Well, I wish I hadn't moved in. The man who lives upstairs often plays the piano till midnight. I really cannot stand it. [Person1]:  Why don't you ask him to stop? [Person2]:  I've tried, but it doesn't work. He never listens to me. what's worse, he isn't the only one that I cannot stand. The woman who lives across the hall often comes over to borrow things, but she seldom returns anything. [Person1]:  Then don't lend her anything. [Person2]:  Now I don't even open the door when she knocks, but it makes me uncomfortable. I'm afraid I'll have to move again. [Person1]:  You can move in with my sister Susan. The girl Jennifer, who was sharing her apartment has moved out so she has an extra room now. [Person2]:  That's great! Your sister is such a good girl. Everyone likes her. I'll call her and move as soon as possible. After all, I need to sleep very well every night in order to do well in the coming exam.
[Person1]:  Good morning, sir. How can I help you? [Person2]:  I'd like to rent a car for the weekend. [Person1]:  Certainly. Do you have a reservation? [Person2]:  No, I'm afraid I don't. [Person1]:  Well, let me see. You're in luck, I have a few cars left. What size car would you like? [Person2]:  Let's see. We have four adults. Have you got any midsize cars? [Person1]:  Yes, I have. I've got a Ford. We have a special rate this weekend, $89 including tax. You get 800 kilometers free. Then it's $0.15 for each additional kilometer. [Person2]:  That sounds reasonable. [Person1]:  May I see your driver's license and a major credit card? [Person2]:  Here you are. [Person1]:  Would you like to buy traffic accident insurance? [Person2]:  No, thanks. I won't need any insurance. My credit card covers it. [Person1]:  May I have your local address? [Person2]:  I'm staying at the hotel, St.Square on Peter St. [Person1]:  Can you sign this agreement in these three places? Thanks, you can pick up your car in the parking lot. Yours is the white Ford. [Person2]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  What was the biggest turing point in your life? [Person2]:  I use I would say that would be moving out of my parents' house for the first time. [Person1]:  Really? Why is that? [Person2]:  Till I moved out of my parents' home, I became a lot more independent. [Person1]:  What would you say was the lowest point in your life? [Person2]:  That would definitely be getting a divorce. [Person1]:  What went wrong? [Person2]:  We just weren't right for each other. [Person1]:  How long were you married? [Person2]:  The marriage only lasted about a year. [Person1]:  Have you remarried since then? [Person2]:  Yes, I got married to a man that I met shortly after I divorced my first husband. [Person1]:  Do you think you'll ever get a divorce again? [Person2]:  Oh I hope not, my first marriage was a mistake, but this one isn't. [Person1]:  How long have you been married? [Person2]:  About 15 years now. [Person1]:  Do you think you'll still love him when he is old and gray? [Person2]:  I think so, hopefully we'll have a long and a happy life together. [Person1]:  I'm sure you will.
[Person1]:  I see Mike farmer has make it into the Olympic team. He beat the national record by 0. 1 of a second. [Person2]:  That ' s great. He ' s the best runner I ' Ve seen this season. I ' m sure he ' ll win a medal at the Olympics. [Person1]:  I think you ' re right. I think we have a very good athletics team. They should do well in the Olympics. How many medals do you think we ' ll win? [Person2]:  I really don ' t know. I don ' t think we ' ll win many gold medals, but I think we should win several silver and bronze ones. [Person1]:  What do you think our chance are in other events. [Person2]:  In the last Olympics, we did very well in swimming, cycling and ball sports. I think we ' ll do well in those same events. [Person1]:  We might get a gold medal in the sailing too. Our team put in a lot of practice. [Person2]:  I think we can expect to get between 30 to 40 medals in total. [Person1]:  You are very optimistic!
[Person1]:  Oh, there is something wrong with my car. [Person2]:  Your car is rather old. Why not change a new one? [Person1]:  I want to change a new car. I like Honda best, especially the red one. But it is too expensive. [Person2]:  Oh, there is a car exhibition tomorrow afternoon. I have two tickets. Would you like to go there with me? [Person1]:  Yeah. Maybe I can find my favorite car in addition to Honda. [Person2]:  And the bank will offer you loans for twenty years!
[Person1]:  Do you have any plan on your mind? [Person2]:  I want to see all places of renown in Suzhou. [Person1]:  How are we going there, by bike or by bus? [Person2]:  By bike, of course. You don't want to miss the beautiful scenery, do you?
[Person1]:  Has Mien sold his house yet? [Person2]:  Yes, he has. He sold it last week. [Person1]:  Has he moved to his new house yet? [Person2]:  No, not yet. He's still here. He's going to move tomorrow. [Person1]:  When? Tomorrow morning? [Person2]:  No. Tomorrow afternoon. I'll miss him. He has always been a good neighbour. [Person1]:  He's a very nice person. We will all miss him. [Person2]:  When will the new people move into this house? [Person1]:  I think that they will move in the day after tomorrow. [Person2]:  Will you see Mien today, Janey?

[Person1]:  Well, Peter, you have to do better than that next time, won't you? [Person2]:  Have I really got to do those exams again, Dad? [Person1]:  Of course, you have. You must try harder this time. [Person2]:  And must I go back to school? [Person1]:  No, you needn't do that. You'd better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes. [Person2]:  But Dad, I should be working full-time at my age. I'm nearly 17. [Person1]:  You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn't have failed your exams. You have to take a job and study. [Person2]:  What else I've got to do? Join the army? [Person1]:  Who knows! That might come to later.
[Person1]:  I'd like to have internet on my computer. [Person2]:  Do you know what kind of internet you would like to get? [Person1]:  What are my options? [Person2]:  You can either get dial-up or DEL. [Person1]:  Which one would you recommend? [Person2]:  DEL is the best choice. [Person1]:  Why is DEL better? [Person2]:  It's a lot better because it doesn't tie up your phone line. [Person1]:  What exactly does that mean? [Person2]:  Well, with dial-up your internet is connected by your phone line. [Person1]:  That means that I can't use my phone and the internet at the same time, right? [Person2]:  That's right. You won't have that problem with DEL.
[Person1]:  How are you, Mr. Wilson? I am Tina. [Person2]:  Glad to meet you, Mrs. Tina. [Person1]:  Please have a seat. I know our employment of forcer has already given you the information about your employee contract, but I'd like to go over the main details again before signing. First, you'll be getting a monthly salary, with one month paid vacation after one year of service. [Person2]:  That's what I understand. [Person1]:  You'll be covered by our medical plan while on duty. Since you'll be middle management, you're expected to be available up to 1. 5 hours past normal working hours. Any approved time over that will be paid at time and a half, which you can take as salary or time off. [Person2]:  Exactly my understanding. [Person1]:  A reasonable number of sick days will be covered by the company. Any extended illness will be covered by insurance. Have you read the other terms of the contract? [Person2]:  Yes, I have. [Person1]:  Do you have any other questions? [Person2]:  Just one. I noticed an item about flex-time. Is that a possibility for me? [Person1]:  Yes, it is, but you'll have to discuss the details with your manager. [Person2]:  That's acceptable. [Person1]:  Good. Now, if you'll just sign here, you can start work in 3 days.
[Person1]:  How are you, Mr. Zhang? [Person2]:  Very well, thank you. And you? [Person1]:  Fine, too, thanks. We met one year ago. We both took part in a party held by our company last year. [Person2]:  That's right. How nice to see you again. [Person1]:  Me too. How is your family? [Person2]:  they are doing well. [Person1]:  Say'hello'to them for me. [Person2]:  Of course. They will be happy you asked about them.
[Person1]:  Hello, Elizabeth. How are you? [Person2]:  Fine, thanks. [Person1]:  Are you sure you're all right? You look a bit worried today. Is anything wrong? [Person2]:  Well, yes, there is something wrong actually. Perhaps you can give me some advice. [Person1]:  Of course, if I can. [Person2]:  Well, last night when I returned from the theatre, I found that I'd lost my wallet. [Person1]:  Oh dear! That's terrible! What was in your wallet? [Person2]:  Well, some money. of course, my visa, all my identity cards and some photos. [Person1]:  Well, if were you, I'd go to the police station straight away and report it. [Person2]:  Yes, I've already done that, and they said they'd look for it. But we're leaving soon and I need my visa and identity cards badly. [Person1]:  Oh dear! What a pity! Are you sure you lost the wallet in the theatre? [Person2]:  Yes, quite sure. [Person1]:  I think you should put an advertisement in the China Daily, saying when and where you lost it. [Person2]:  But that takes too long. [Person1]:  Wait a minute! My uncle lives in Beijing and he lives very close to the theatre. I'll telephone him and ask him to go there to inquire about it. You'd better have breakfast now and I'll meet you later.
[Person1]:  Hi, Dave. Good to see you could come a long way. Come in. [Person2]:  Wow. Looks like the party is at a high point. [Person1]:  Yeah. And they're eating all of my food. Oh, I'd like you to meet my sister, Carol. She's visiting on the weekend. [Person2]:  Oh. Which one is she? [Person1]:  She's sitting on the sofa over there. [Person2]:  You mean the woman with long black hair? [Person1]:  That's right. Let me introduce her to you. You're both so friendly and adventurous. [Person2]:  And who's the man sitting next to her? Uh, the man wearing the suit jacket? [Person1]:  Oh, that's Bob, my ballet teacher. [Person2]:  Ballet teacher! I never knew you could do ballet. [Person1]:  I started about two months ago. Come on. I'd like you to meet them. [Person2]:  I'm coming.
[Person1]:  I am a reporter from Channel 5 News. [Person2]:  What's up? [Person1]:  Could I ask you some questions? [Person2]:  Sure, you can. [Person1]:  Did you vote today? [Person2]:  I sure did! [Person1]:  What candidate did you vote for? [Person2]:  I can't disclose that information. [Person1]:  Why is that? [Person2]:  My vote is my own private business. [Person1]:  I understand. [Person2]:  I voted for our next President.
[Person1]:  What's the date today, Mr. Brown? I don't have a calendar.  [Person2]:  Today is Tuesday, 25th September, 2001.  [Person1]:  25th Sep? Oh, I have an appointment tonight.  [Person2]:  What time is your appointment?  [Person1]:  It is at 8 o'clock .  [Person2]:  What time is now? Do you have the correct time?  [Person1]:  I don't know what time it is.  [Person2]:  It must be about 6 o'clock.  [Person1]:  I have to go now. I don't want to be late.  [Person2]:  You won't be late. It's still early. 
[Person1]:  Thank god you showed up when you did! He's insane! Do you think we should call the police?  [Person2]:  Don't worry about it, I'll call my friend and have him take care of it. I can't believe he was stalking you all these years. What a nut job!  [Person1]:  I know! Well. . . he said I'm not pregnant. I'm sorry if I got you all worked up over nothing. I want you to know that I didn't do it on purpose. . .  [Person2]:  Don't apologize! From the moment I met you, not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you. And now that I'm with you again, I'm. . . I'm just scared, Veronica. The closer I get to you, the worse it gets. The thought of not being with you, I mean, I just can't handle it! We were made for each other, Veronica. You are my everything, my soul mate. What can I do?  [Person1]:  Just hold me. . . I'll always be here for you, no matter what. And together, we can tackle whatever life throws at us. I believe in us, steven.  [Person2]:  I'm so happy to hear that! I knew we belong together. I love you so much. 
[Person1]:  As you can see, I have a degree in finance and I also have 3 years of work experience at a major Wall Street firm. [Person2]:  Yes, but this is not exactly a finance job. It has more to do with marketing and advertising. [Person1]:  I see, is it possible that I am in the wrong office? I thought I was applying for a financial manager position. [Person2]:  Let me give them a call and see if there was a mistake with the schedule. There might be a marketing expert downstairs with the finance people.
[Person1]:  Mom, I'm hungry. [Person2]:  Look in the fridge. [Person1]:  I'm looking, there's nothing to eat, it's almost empty. [Person2]:  Are you sure? I went to the market yesterday. [Person1]:  I don't see anything. [Person2]:  I bought lots of oranges and apples. [Person1]:  I don't want fruit, I want something tasty. [Person2]:  Eat the fruit it's good for you. [Person1]:  Next time you go to the market. Let me go with you. [Person2]:  No, all you want to eat all hot dogs and candy bars.
[Person1]:  Bob, I'm sure you know about secondhand smoke. [Person2]:  Of course, I do. [Person1]:  But have you heard about thirdhand smoke? [Person2]:  Third hand smoke? I'm afraid not. What is it then? [Person1]:  Well, it's here in today's paper. Parents may think they are protecting children from secondhand smoke when they smoke outside their home or only when the children are not there. But now researchers are warning about what they call third hand smoke. When you smoke dangerous matter from cigarettes gets into your hair and clothing. As babies are the weakest when you come to a baby. You pass it to the baby and increase the chances of disease in the baby. [Person2]:  Is that so? In that case. I have to say that I should never get close to a baby. [Person1]:  That's right. Actually, all smoking parents should do the same or better give it up completely.
[Person1]:  Passport, please, madam. [Person2]:  Just a minute, please. It's in my bag. Here it is. [Person1]:  Thank you. Please fill out the Baggage Declaration Form. [Person2]:  All right. Shall I enter all my belongings? [Person1]:  No, only the articles listed on the Declaration.
[Person1]:  What do you need? [Person2]:  I would like to check out a book. [Person1]:  I'm going to need your library card. [Person2]:  I don't have a library card. [Person1]:  Why don't you apply for one right now? [Person2]:  Sure. That would be great. [Person1]:  Please fill out this application. [Person2]:  Okay. Here you go. [Person1]:  Now, sign your name on the back of the card. [Person2]:  Here you go. [Person1]:  Here's your library card. [Person2]:  Thanks. Now I'd like to check out this book.
[Person1]:  Hey! Taxi. [Person2]:  Where are you heading, sir? [Person1]:  Capital Airport. [Person2]:  What's your flight time? [Person1]:  At 7 [Person2]:  I guess we should get there no later than 7 [Person1]:  How long is the ride from here then? [Person2]:  Well, since it's rush hour, I'd say the ride would take about thirty minutes, more or less. Is that okay? [Person1]:  Yes, that'll be fine. How much is this going to cost?
[Person1]:  You spoken English is pretty good. Please tell me your experience in learning English. [Person2]:  Uh, I don't know what to say. What do you want to know? [Person1]:  What's your method of learning? [Person2]:  Let me think a minute. I think I always try to take every chance to practice. [Person1]:  What if there is no chance? I mean what if you don't have a partner, what will you do? [Person2]:  Well, I talk to myself. That is, I play one role first, then the other. [Person1]:  That's a good idea. You are really creative.
[Person1]:  Whoa, whoa, what's going on? Watch out! [Person2]:  Hey, watch where you're going! [Person1]:  Oh, no! I'm so sorry! Are you all right? [Person2]:  Oh. . . I don't know. [Person1]:  I feel terrible, I really didn't mean to knock you over. My tire, just exploded, and I lost control of my bike. Really, it was an accident. Please accept my apologies. [Person2]:  Oh, wait a second, you seem really familiar, I think I know you from somewhere. [Person1]:  Yeah, I think we have met somewhere before. That's right! We met at Aaron's place last weekend! What a coincidence! But anyway, I'm glad to see that you're not too badly hurt, and I should probably get going. I have a nine o'clock meeting. [Person2]:  Ouch! My ankle! I think it's broken! You can't just leave me like this! Are you calling an ambulance? [Person1]:  Nope, I'm canceling my appointment so that I can stay here with you.
[Person1]:  What do you expect of the position? [Person2]:  I hope to apply my knowledge and experience on the job and make further improvement. [Person1]:  What do you think about occupational planning? [Person2]:  It is quite important for all of us. Without clear goals, one may lose direction and cannot pave the way for their future. [Person1]:  Tell me something about your goals. [Person2]:  As a graduate, it may be more important to develop myself effectively in my future work. And whatever job I may take, I will make the best efforts. [Person1]:  If confronted with difficult task, what will you do? [Person2]:  I will make full use of the chance and get myself ready for the challenges all the time. [Person1]:  Would you care much about your salary? [Person2]:  Salary is, admittedly, important, but I will care more about what I can learn from the job. [Person1]:  If you were assigned some work which you are not so interested, would you take it or not? [Person2]:  I would take it. After all, interest is not the only thing one should care about.
[Person1]:  Kata! You've got a beautiful singing voice. You hit the high notes perfectly. [Person2]:  Thank you for your compliment. But you are exaggerating. I think you are destined to be a singer. You have the best voice! [Person1]:  Thank you. Maybe we can sing a song together. Would you like to sing with me? [Person2]:  Yes, I'd like to. It's my honor. Let's pick a song. [Person1]:  How about this one? [Person2]:  Sorry, I can't sing the song. [Person1]:  Er. . . How about this one? [Person2]:  OK. But I'm not familiar. I don't know the beginning part. [Person1]:  Never mind. You can follow me. I'll sing the first part. [Person2]:  OK.
[Person1]:  My latte looks like that shoe polish we did an ad for last month. [Person2]:  And this espresso looks like. . . oil! [Person1]:  It still tastes fine, though. [Person2]:  These days, I can't think of anything but motor oil. Even coffee makes me think of it. [Person1]:  Wait a second! There's the idea for this case! ' Your motor oil should be as choice and fresh as your morning coffee. '
[Person1]:  I was wondering if you could go over the services available at EDD to help me get a job. [Person2]:  The best opportunity is called callous, which is an Internet-based job placement service that you can make use of. [Person1]:  Do I have to have a computer at home? [Person2]:  There are computers at our EDD offices for you to use in your job search. [Person1]:  Do you have any other services available? [Person2]:  We have information available about the job market as well as workshops. [Person1]:  What kinds of workshops are available at the EDD? [Person2]:  We have workshops in Resume Writing and Interviewing, to name a few. [Person1]:  Are there other places, outside of EDD, that I may look for work? [Person2]:  College job placement services can help.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, am I going the right way for a few far? [Person2]:  I'm afraid not. [Person1]:  Oh, how can I get there? [Person2]:  Are you on foot? [Person1]:  Unfortunately, yes. [Person2]:  Well. It's easy enough to get there. You need to go down this road till you see a track on your left. Maybe half a mile off. [Person1]:  Half a mile, ok. [Person2]:  Then, take that track and keep going for another half mile. [Person1]:  It's over a mile away? [Person2]:  Oh, at least. Now, we get in a bridge, go straight over. [Person1]:  Er, ha. [Person2]:  Then a little way passed, you'll see a sign 'Hill Farm' on your left. [Person1]:  And that's finally it? [Person2]:  Yes. [Person1]:  Got it. Err, you're not driving that way, are you? [Person2]:  Sorry. [Person1]:  Well, no harm asking. Thanks for your help!
[Person1]:  How do you use an ATM card, Billy?  [Person2]:  It's easy grandpa. Insert you card into the machine here. Then wait a moment. Ok. Now you enter your PIN. It should have four numbers.  [Person1]:  Oh yes. I've got it written down here. Just a minute.  [Person2]:  You really shouldn't write it down. You should memorise it. You can change it to a more convenient number if you like.  [Person1]:  Ok, I've entered my PIN. There are several options on the screen. I guess I just choose which service I want, don't I ?  [Person2]:  Yes. Choose the service you need to use. If you choose to withdraw money, the machine will ask you how much you want.  [Person1]:  I can just enter the amount using the key, right?  [Person2]:  That's right. Give the machine a moment to process you request. Then take your money.  [Person1]:  These machines aren't very difficult to use. In fact, I quite like them. They are much faster than dealing with a band clerk. 
[Person1]:  Excuse me, are you the person who has a house for sale? [Person2]:  Yes, I am, come in. Let me show you around. [Person1]:  Thank you very much. How long have you lived here? [Person2]:  I've lived here since I was married, my husband and I had our twentieth wedding anniversary yesterday. [Person1]:  Wow! Congratulations! Then why do you want to sell it? [Person2]:  I am going to retire next year, my husband is opening a small book store in Sydney. So I want to move there to help him. [Person1]:  How much money do you want for the house? [Person2]:  $200,000. [Person1]:  That's a lot of money. I can't decide now. Well, I'll have to discuss it with my wife. May I call back tomorrow? [Person2]:  Certainly.
[Person1]:  How are the children doing at sport? [Person2]:  I ' m very pleased with their performances. Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds. That ' s very fast for a kid his age. [Person1]:  He ' s not very good at the long jump though, is he? [Person2]:  He ' s not bad. He can jump a distance of over four meters. I think he just prefers running to jumping. Jimmy ' s very good at the high jump. He can jump over two meters. Again, that ' s fine for someone his age. [Person1]:  Two meters? That means that the high jump bar is above his head! Are any of them good at long-distance running? [Person2]:  The longest race we run is the 1500 meters. A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes. [Person1]:  How are they at swimming? [Person2]:  They ' re ok. I ask them to swim 500 meters each day. That ' s 20 lengths of the swimming pool. They ' re not very fast, but that ' s ok. I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape. [Person1]:  Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters. [Person2]:  I ' d be afraid to jump from that height! [Person1]:  I think that these kinds haven ' t learnt to be afraid yet. She started diving from a lower height, but she soon wanted to go higher. [Person2]:  It seems that they really enjoy trying to go faster, higher and further.
[Person1]:  How do you know? I thought Taiwanese people didn't have garage sales. [Person2]:  You're right. We're not really into used stuff. [Person1]:  Well, I've grown to like second-hand things. I wouldn't have gotten through university without them! [Person2]:  There aren't many places that sell used things in Taiwan, besides auction websites. [Person1]:  I use those sites. Hey! Let's go check out a flea market later. [Person2]:  Great! I can teach you men a thing or two about shopping!
[Person1]:  Can I help you? [Person2]:  Yes. I am a bit confused. My sociology class is supposed to read a chapter in a book called Sociology and the Modern Age. According to the syllabus, the book is in the library, but I haven't been able to find it. [Person1]:  Do you have your syllabus with you? May I see it? [Person2]:  Yes, uh. . . I put it in the front of my sociology notebook. Oh, here it is. [Person1]:  Let me see. Oh yes. Your professor has placed this book on reserve. That means you cannot find it on the shelves in its usual place. You need to go to a special room called the reserve room. It's down the hall and to the right. [Person2]:  I'm sorry - I still don't understand. [Person1]:  You see, your professor wants every one in the class to read the chapter. If one student removes the book from the library, it is likely that none of the other students will have the opportunity to read it. So, your professor has insured that all students have the opportunity to read it by placing it on reserve. [Person2]:  So, will I be able to find this book? [Person1]:  Yes, when a book is on reserve, a student can go to the reserve room and ask the reserve librarian for the book. The student can have the book for a few hours, and he or she MUST read it in the library during that time. That way, the book stays in the library, and all students have a chance to read it. [Person2]:  Okay. Thank you. I understand now. [Person1]:  Will there be anything else? [Person2]:  No! I am on my way to the reserve room. Thanks again!
[Person1]:  Are you feeling OK? [Person2]:  My stomach is bothering me. [Person1]:  What have you been eating? [Person2]:  I had a ham sandwich with mayonnaise for lunch. [Person1]:  Maybe the food had something wrong with it. [Person2]:  It could be bad food, but I didn't feel so well yesterday, either. [Person1]:  Have you been under a lot of pressure lately? [Person2]:  I haven't been under any more stress than usual. [Person1]:  Perhaps you have caught that bug that is going around. [Person2]:  I feel like maybe I am coming down with the flu.
[Person1]:  What a busy week! [Person2]:  Really! I've never seen so much work. [Person1]:  Right. How are you going to spend your weekend? [Person2]:  I don't know. I have no idea. [Person1]:  Would you like to play some tennis with me before going home? [Person2]:  I'm not good at sports, I have never played tennis, and I know I would be terrible. [Person1]:  You should try it. It's a great game. Come on, let me help you. I'm a good player, and a good teacher, too. What do you say? [Person2]:  OK, but don't say I didn't warn you. [Person1]:  That was a pretty good shot, Mary. [Person2]:  Thanks. This is fun! [Person1]:  Let me help you with your serve. [Person2]:  No one has ever tried to show me how to play a sport before. Maybe I should learn to do something. [Person1]:  Of course, you can. All you need is a little help and a lot of practice. [Person2]:  Do you really think I can be a good player? [Person1]:  Well, maybe not a Michael Zhang, but better than the average. Person would you like to play again Wednesday? [Person2]:  Yes. This has been fun.
[Person1]:  Should I go now? [Person2]:  Nice and easy. Just give it a little gas. [Person1]:  Nothing is happening! [Person2]:  First you have to put the car into gear. Move this shifter so the arrow points at D for drive. [Person1]:  What do these other letters mean? [Person2]:  R is for reverse, P is for park, and D1 and D2 are lower gears for going through snow, or up a steep hill.
[Person1]:  Hi, Kerry. Did your husband make cooking for you? [Person2]:  Oh, please do not mention it any more. Last night he did it for the first time. [Person1]:  Really? Was it delicious? [Person2]:  Forget it! It was a bitter pill for me to swallow. [Person1]:  It was the first time. You should not be so particular. [Person2]:  Ha-ha. Last night, I only told him practice makes perfect. [Person1]:  It's true. Nowadays, men are spending more and more time in the kitchen. [Person2]:  Yeah, it will become a wider trend.
[Person1]:  Ok, let's go through this one more time. I don't want anymore ruined or dyed blouses! [Person2]:  I know, I know. OK, so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine. [Person1]:  Right. You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing. For example for delicates, you should set a shorter washing cycle. Also, be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing. [Person2]:  So complicated! Ok, what about this red wine stain? How do I get it out? [Person1]:  Since this is a white t-shirt, you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick. [Person2]:  Cool. Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it's all set right? [Person1]:  No! Since you are washing delicates and cotton, you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes. [Person2]:  You know what? I'll just have everything dry cleaned.
[Person1]:  Good morning, I'd like to open a savings account. Can you tell me on how to go about it? [Person2]:  OK. You have to fill out this form and let me see three identification cards or documents. [Person1]:  I have my passport with me, a driver's license and a membership card. Will they do? [Person2]:  Let me see them. Yes, they're OK. [Person1]:  What's the minimum amount I can deposit in an account? [Person2]:  You can deposit an initial amount of five dollars. [Person1]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  Good morning. This is Shanghai Car Rental. [Person2]:  Good morning, Miss. A friend of mine suggested I call you to hire a car. [Person1]:  Oh, yes. A lot of people do this these days. [Person2]:  Yes, we are just on holiday here for a few days and they said it would be a good idea to hire a car to get around the city. [Person1]:  Well, it certainly is. What kind of car do you want to hire? [Person2]:  What can you suggest? [Person1]:  We have a variety of choice, such as Xiali, which is the cheapest, 200 yuan a day, Citroen, Jatta, Elysee, but Santana sedans are the big favorite these days. [Person2]:  How much if I hire a Santana for three days? [Person1]:  Oh, that will be 1,200 yuan. [Person2]:  On, it sounds a bit too expensive. What about a Jetta? [Person1]:  It will be 300 yuan a day. [Person2]:  Then I'd better hire a Jetta tomorrow morning, would there be any problem? [Person1]:  No problem at all. Now let me take down your name and telephone number.
[Person1]:  Good morning, Madam. Can I help you? [Person2]:  Yes, er...I want to see the West End. [Person1]:  How much time do you have? [Person2]:  Just one day. [Person1]:  Well, what do you particularly want to do? [Person2]:  I want to visit museums, art galleries, Buckingham Palace, do some shopping, and go to the theaters. [Person1]:  But you only have one day. [Person2]:  That's right. [Person1]:  Well. Why not do some shopping first? [Person2]:  Where can I do that? [Person1]:  In Oxford Street. [Person2]:  How can I get there? [Person1]:  You can walk through Hyde Park. It's quite near. [Person2]:  Wonderful. Thanks for your help. [Person1]:  You're welcome. Have a good time!
[Person1]:  I just can't believe this is our last year. College is going by fast. [Person2]:  Yeah. We'll have to face the real world soon. So, have you figured out what you're going to do after you graduate? I just can't believe this is our last year.
[Person1]:  Is everything going well according to the plan? [Person2]:  Our store will open two weeks before Christmas. [Person1]:  I guess we should announce ourselves soon. Tell people we're coming. Put up a big sign. [Person2]:  Sure. The minute they see the sign, they will be lining up. [Person1]:  To show their anger. [Person2]:  Yeah. They are lining up not to buy things but to show their anger. Because some people think chain stores all look the same. [Person1]:  They'll hate us in the beginning. But we'll get them in the end.
[Person1]:  Hi, Jenny. Is it true you're moving to London? [Person2]:  Yes, it is. [Person1]:  What made you decide to do that? [Person2]:  Work, mainly. I'm sure I'll be able to find a job there. [Person1]:  You're probably right. But where are you going to live? [Person2]:  I hope I'll find a flat to share with somebody. That way it will be cheaper. [Person1]:  Yes, that's a good idea. Are you taking your dog with you? [Person2]:  No, I don't think so. My parents have offered to take care of him, and I don't think he'd be happy in the city. [Person1]:  You're probably right. But aren't you afraid of moving to such a big place, especially after living in a small village? [Person2]:  Not really. I think I'll enjoy myself. There's so much to do there; I expect I won't miss the countryside much and I can always come back and visit. [Person1]:  Well, I just hope you'll invite me to stay when you get settled. [Person2]:  Of course I will.
[Person1]:  Excuse me? Do you have anything for a carsickness?  [Person2]:  Yes, but you look fine.  [Person1]:  Oh, it's for my brother. The little boy over there. He is getting a carsickness.  [Person2]:  Poor boy! But don't worry. Here are two pills made in Germany. It's really effective. He will be just fine.  [Person1]:  Thank you so much.  [Person2]:  Take some with you next time, just in case.  [Person1]:  Sorry to interrupt, but my brother is still sleeping.  [Person2]:  You mean the boy who felt carsick just now?  [Person1]:  Yes. It's so strange that he slept all the time after taking the pills.  [Person2]:  Oh, sorry, maybe I gave you the wrong medicine.  [Person1]:  What?  [Person2]:  It's just sleeping pills made in America which is also very good. But don't worry. It has no undesirable side-effects.  [Person1]:  I see. 
[Person1]:  Why, Tom? It's five to six already and you are still writing here.  [Person2]:  So what ? Are we going anywhere?  [Person1]:  Yes , have you forgotten? We have arranged to go to Mary's to watch some videos tonight.  [Person2]:  Oh , I'm sorry I forgot all about it. Well, can I take a rain check?  [Person1]:  What's the matter with you ? You are the one that persuaded all of us to go there.  [Person2]:  I'm terribly sorry, Rose. But I have to finish this paper by tomorrow or professor Martin will kill me. 
[Person1]:  What is my schedule for tomorrow, Lisa? [Person2]:  Well, your flight leaves from Heathrow at 7 [Person1]:  And then? [Person2]:  Then you can take the shuttle bus into town. [Person1]:  Oh, yes, of course. And the meetings, when do they begin? [Person2]:  The meetings will start at 10 [Person1]:  That's fine. Then I will be able to have dinner with my wife.
[Person1]:  Would you like some tea or coffee? [Person2]:  No thank you. It's very late now, that will keep me awake the whole night. [Person1]:  Then what about some water? [Person2]:  Yes, please. [Person1]:  Don't work too late since you were not in good health. You should be careful with your health. [Person2]:  I know, but I have to finish these reports tonight. Our manager will use them at the meeting tomorrow morning. [Person1]:  Can I help you with something? [Person2]:  No, I'm afraid you can't. Just turn down the TV a little, so that it's not so noisy. [Person1]:  I will, I do hope that you will finish the report soon and get some sleep. [Person2]:  Don't worry, it won't take me too long.
[Person1]:  Anything interesting on now? [Person2]:  No, I was reading a local news report about a big fire. [Person1]:  Where was the fire? [Person2]:  In the center of the city. [Person1]:  Has anyone got injured? [Person2]:  Yes, at least 30 people were injured. Fortunately, no deaths have been reported. [Person1]:  Thank goodness. Tom, I need to go out in about 15 minutes and I will come back around 7 [Person2]:  OK, when will mom come back for supper tonight? [Person1]:  She will get home around 6 [Person2]:  I'll get supper ready right before you get back.
[Person1]:  The guest for today is Sue Walter. She is a famous judge in court. Good morning, Sue. [Person2]:  Good morning, Sean. I am glad to be here today. [Person1]:  Your new book, My World, will be published next week. Would you please tell us the theme of your book? [Person2]:  Well, I want people who have challenges in their lives to believe that despite their difficulties, they can still accomplish a lot. One of my suggestions is to always ask for help. [Person1]:  Right. What's the best part of being a judge in court? [Person2]:  Having a voice in the decision making process. There is something extremely satisfying about that. [Person1]:  You've been on the children's program, so how do you explain your job to kids? [Person2]:  I gave a very simplified version of what a judge does. I talked to them about how the law helps people solve their problems. [Person1]:  What's your idea of happiness? [Person2]:  I think it would be satisfaction of enjoying things with others. Meaning when you give it to others whether it's time, attention a gift anything, just those moments of sharing. [Person1]:  Thank you, Sue.
[Person1]:  Hey, Lucy. Do you have some time to talk about next week's trip with me? [Person2]:  Sure, Dave. [Person1]:  OK. So, we're leaving on Monday from Hartsfield International Airport, and returning on Friday. Do we take ourselves to the airport? Maybe we need to book a taxi, or just go by bus. [Person2]:  No, we don't have to. The company car will pick us up and take us there. [Person1]:  Oh, that's good. When? [Person2]:  Our flight leaves at 11 [Person1]:  How much will that be? [Person2]:  Well, New York is a pretty expensive city. So, each of us will get $200 a day. [Person1]:  Oh, OK. Thanks for telling me that. [Person2]:  You're welcome.
[Person1]:  I ' m thinking about getting a pet, but I ' m really not sure which animal would be suitable. Could you give me some advice? [Person2]:  Certainly! The first thing is to be honest about how much time for you can devote to your pet. Dogs are very demanding. You need to take them for walks and they love to play. Cats, on the other hand, are more independent. [Person1]:  I ' m fairly busy, so I really need an animal that I don ' t need to care of very much. Actually, I ' d like a pet that ' s a little unusual. I don't ' really want a typical pet, like a cat, dog, or hamster. Do you have any suggestions? [Person2]:  Unusual pet are often more expensive to keep. Is that a problem? [Person1]:  Not really. By the way, I don ' t want a pet that could be dangerous, like a tarantula or rattlesnake. [Person2]:  We have those, but I only sell them to people I know well, for obvious reasons. How about a lizard? I have some that are very brightly coloured, are not aggressive, and are easy to feed and look after. [Person1]:  That sounds ideal. Could you show me some? [Person2]:  Sure. Come over here. As you can see, I have a wide selection of species. They can live together, if you want lizards of different kinds. Do you have a favourite colour? [Person1]:  I like the red one. What do they eat? [Person2]:  You can feed them on various things. They will eat small pieces of meat, but I ' d recommend insects. You can get them from your garden, but remember that lizards eat a lot insects. I sell them here. [Person1]:  Thanks a lot. What I ' ll do si find out more online and drop by next week. [Person2]:  That ' s fine. You shouldn ' t make a hasty decision when choosing a pet.
[Person1]:  Dad, hurry! The train is coming. Aha, I am a superman. [Person2]:  Don't rush, behave yourself please! Let the people get off first. [Person1]:  Oh, we should. There are so many people. What if the train got full before we could get in? [Person2]:  But, if we all pushed our way in, nobody could get off, and nobody could get in either. [Person1]:  How many stops are there to the Aidan station? [Person2]:  There are four more stops. [Person1]:  Oh, my God! [Person2]:  What's wrong? You are like a little monkey, on pins and needles! [Person1]:  Because I need to use the restroom. Is there a restroom on the train? [Person2]:  No, not on the train, but in the station. [Person1]:  Why not? You told me that subway is a kind of train. If it had no restroom. what kind of train would that be? [Person2]:  Well, that is a question. You want to offer a suggestion? [Person1]:  Oh, yeah, but not today. I am busy with praying the subway may get there as fast as possible. [Person2]:  I guess you'll never forget today.
[Person1]:  May I see your ticket and passport, PLS? [Person2]:  Sure, here they are. [Person1]:  Any luggage? [Person2]:  Just this suitcase. [Person1]:  Your backpack is very big and today's flight is quite full. I am afraid that you will have to check your backpack too. [Person2]:  No problem. What about this carry-on? [Person1]:  You can take that with you. [Person2]:  Can I have an aisle seat, PLS. [Person1]:  No problem. I'll give you an aisle seat in the center row. And here is your ticket, passport and boarding pass. Please board the plane at Gate 15. [Person2]:  Thank you. And when is the latest time for me to board the plane? [Person1]:  15mins before the plane takes off. The plane is scheduled to leave on time. [Person2]:  Thank you very much! [Person1]:  You are welcome! Have a nice flight.
[Person1]:  Oh, God. It's late. I'm afraid I have to leave. [Person2]:  But you just got here. Can't you stay a little longer and have some tea? [Person1]:  That's very kind of you. But if I don't go now I'll miss the last bus. [Person2]:  That's too bad. [Person1]:  Thank you for your hospitality. [Person2]:  Thanks for coming. [Person1]:  How about next time we meet at my place? And I'll treat you to Chinese food. I know how much you like it. We can order in and watch video too. Anything you like, I promise. [Person2]:  Great idea. I'm looking forward to it. See you then. [Person1]:  Well. I really do have to go. [Person2]:  Good night then. [Person1]:  See you tomorrow.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, can I have your passport, your immigration form and your Customs Declaration Form, please? [Person2]:  OK. Here you are. [Person1]:  How long will you be staying at Hotel in China? [Person2]:  About three weeks. [Person1]:  And what's the purpose of your visit? [Person2]:  Sightseeing. [Person1]:  And where will you be staying? [Person2]:  At the Friendship Hotel in Beijing. [Person1]:  OK. Could you put your hand baggage on the counter, please? Do you have any gifts, or food in here? [Person2]:  Yes, I have some fresh apples in my suitcase. [Person1]:  I'm sorry, sir, you can't bring fresh fruit into China. I'm going to have to confiscate these. [Person2]:  Oh, that's too bad.
[Person1]:  Your prices seem a little high. [Person2]:  We could make it lower for you. What's your counter-offer? [Person1]:  We make a counter-offer to you of $ 150 per metric ton F. O. B. London. [Person2]:  If you order in large lots, we'll accept the price. [Person1]:  OK. We will increase our order. [Person2]:  All right, as a token of friendship, we accept your counter-offer. [Person1]:  I'm glad that we've settled the price.
[Person1]:  I've just done the most amazing Healthy Living Day at the sports center. [Person2]:  Cool! But what's a Healthy Living Day! [Person1]:  Well, you learn to live in a healthy way. Everyone does three activities. In the morning, you can choose two different indoor activities and in the afternoon, you can try one activity outdoors. [Person2]:  Sounds like hard work! Why did you do it? [Person1]:  I wanted to do a new activity, so I went with my cousin Georgia. She doesn't do enough exercise. We make lots of new friends. [Person2]:  Were you both really tired when you finished? [Person1]:  Georgia was and she didn't feel very well. I was OK but I needed something to drink. [Person2]:  Well, when's the next Day? I'd love to go. I know I'm free most Saturdays after April 14th. [Person1]:  Oh, I've just booked a place for July 5th but I think the next one is on May 28th. [Person2]:  Great! I'll come to the same one as you! Are you going to go cycling again? [Person1]:  Not this time. I'm going to do advanced skateboarding. I wanted to try boating but that group is full. [Person2]:  Wow! I'd like to do that too!
[Person1]:  I need to lose some weight, after eating so much over the holiday. [Person2]:  Me too. I had so many cookies that I gained 5 pounds. I feel so fat. [Person1]:  Should we join a gym? A membership at Total Fitness is only $25 per month. [Person2]:  Yes, you can use the weight machines, which I know you like. [Person1]:  And you can take some fitness classes to quickly lose those 5 pounds.
[Person1]:  May I speak to you, Mr. Hall? [Person2]:  Sure, Sonya. What's the problem? [Person1]:  My photography classe's meeting early today. Can I leave at 4 [Person2]:  Is it important? [Person1]:  Yes, it is. We're getting our assignments and I have to be there on time. [Person2]:  You have a lot of letters to type. Can you come in early tomorrow morning and finish them? [Person1]:  Oh, sure. [Person2]:  Then you can go ahead and leave early. [Person1]:  Thanks a lot Mr. Hall. [Person2]:  You're welcome.
[Person1]:  Hey, Mr. Ben. Can you spare me one minute? [Person2]:  Of course. What's wrong? [Person1]:  First of all, I'd like to say that I've enjoyed working with you. However, I... [Person2]:  Oh no. Do you mean you want to leave? [Person1]:  I'm sorry, but I have worked here for 7 years and this position 3 years. I want to change my environment. [Person2]:  That's really bad news to me. How about double wages? [Person1]:  Thank you for appreciating me. I'm quitting because I want to try something different. [Person2]:  What a pity. But wish you a good time in the new company.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, waiter, would you please bring us a nest? A friend of mine will join us. [Person2]:  Wait a moment. Here you are. [Person1]:  By the way, we would like to order some dishes for my friend. [Person2]:  Sure.
[Person1]:  Hi, Francis, how was your business trip? [Person2]:  It was a nightmare. [Person1]:  What's up? [Person2]:  Actually, the business trip itself was very successful. We arrived on time, we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year. [Person1]:  Sounds quite fruitful, why do you call it still a nightmare then? [Person2]:  Well, the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge. I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam. When I finally got home, I was totally exhausted. But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout. [Person1]:  This is really a sad story. Did they trace back your luggage? [Person2]:  I am still waiting for their call. [Person1]:  Take it easy, all sufferings have their reward.
[Person1]:  Hey. I'm a visitor from China. I love your music. It's the best I've ever heard. Will you please spare a little bit of time for me? [Person2]:  Sure. Thank you for saying that. Actually, those songs were sung for the first time today. I wrote them in the past two months. [Person1]:  Oh, you wrote them all by yourself. That's amazing! Are you a regular singer here? [Person2]:  You can say that. But my band and I also sing regularly in several other places, too. [Person1]:  Cool. Your guitar skills are very impressive. How did you learn to play like that? [Person2]:  I picked up guitar at an early age, maybe around 8 years old. Afterward, I taught myself by listening to some records of top players. [Person1]:  Wow, that's unbelievable! You play so well, but you've never been to a real teacher. You will definitely be famous in the near future.
[Person1]:  When do you usually go to the movies? [Person2]:  I usually go in my free time on the weekends. How about you? [Person1]:  The movie theater is always so crowded on the weekends. I like to go to the movies during the week. [Person2]:  That's true. And sometimes the tickets are cheaper during the week as well.
[Person1]:  Welcome to China, Mr. Martin. [Person2]:  Thank you so much. I have been expecting to come to China. [Person1]:  I am very glad that you say so. We have prepared a typical Chinese dinner this evening. [Person2]:  Oh, you needn't do that. [Person1]:  My pleasure.
[Person1]:  Hello. Can I talk to David? [Person2]:  One second, please. ( a few seconds later, the receiver comes back and says ) Hello? [Person1]:  Yes. [Person2]:  I'm sorry. David is out to lunch right now. [Person1]:  Okay. I'm his wife. Could you tell him to call me back when he returns? [Person2]:  Sure. Does he know where to call you? [Person1]:  Oh, thanks. Please tell him to call my cell-phone number. [Person2]:  Ok, I will. [Person1]:  Thank you very much. [Person2]:  No problem.
[Person1]:  Welcome to IBA. What can we do for you? [Person2]:  It's a bit of a problem situation, actually. . . you see, our company has a Corporate Account with you, but unfortunately, we've been experiencing cash flow problems recently. [Person1]:  I'm sorry to hear that. We value all of our customers, regardless of circumstances. What can we do to help? [Person2]:  We are going to need a loan. I'm not sure what loan is suitable for us, though. [Person1]:  If you think it will be very short-term, I would recommend you go with the 60 - day loan. Then it can be paid back quicker, so you won't have to consider it in the future. [Person2]:  That seems like a good idea, it's for wages, you see.
[Person1]:  Hello, sir. How many in your party?  [Person2]:  Just myself. What is the rate?  [Person1]:  OK, a single fare is $50 per right.  [Person2]:  Fine. Do I have to show my passport?  [Person1]:  No, it's not necessary. But you have to fill out this form.  [Person2]:  Sure. 
[Person1]:  Would you please tell me about your best holiday, Nancy? [Person2]:  Well, it was my trip in Nepal. We went there 10 years ago, doing some walking in the mountains. [Person1]:  How long did you stay there? [Person2]:  20 days. [Person1]:  20 days! That's a long time. How far did you walk every day? [Person2]:  Perhaps 15 kilometers. You have to climb up and down a lot every day. [Person1]:  So, it was very hard. [Person2]:  Yes, very hard. Sometimes, it's difficult to walk in the mountains where the air is very thin, and you have a lot of problems when breathing. [Person1]:  What kind of equipment did you take? [Person2]:  Not much. Only a bag, a sleeping bag and some warm clothing. We carried all the things by ourselves. [Person1]:  And how was the food? [Person2]:  There was rice and some vegetables, normally no meat. But it was good. [Person1]:  What was the best thing about the trip? [Person2]:  The walking and the exercise. I hate sitting in the sun and like to be out in the countryside. The air is very clean and it's very quiet. Nepal is a good place. You must go!
[Person1]:  What are you doing now, Steven?  [Person2]:  I am reading a book about money management.  [Person1]:  Oh, my God. Do you want to be a millionaire? I can see you are very crazy about money.  [Person2]:  Everyone wants to earn a lot of money. Don't you think so? What's more, I am interested in money management.  [Person1]:  No, you are wrong. Money can't buy happiness and health. I won't sacrifice my health in order to get money. In other words, I don't want to be a millionaire and I want to have more free time to enjoy life.  [Person2]:  Oh, I see. But a proverb says 'Money makes the mare go. ' I think it will be better if you have more money.  [Person1]:  Maybe you are right. Please take care of yourself when you make money. Anyway health is the most important thing.  [Person2]:  Thank you for your caring. I will.  [Person1]:  No thanks. 
[Person1]:  I find it really hard to express myself in class. I have lots of ideas, but they never seem to come out of my mouth.  [Person2]:  let me give you a little advice. You know what the topics are going to be, so prepares what you would like to say in advance.  [Person1]:  I often do, but I'm worried about the responses from other people.  [Person2]:  you have to be realistic. Not everyone is going to agree with you, but people will respect your opinion and they will respect the fact that you have contributed something to the discussion.  [Person1]:  I'm worried that what I say will not make sense.  [Person2]:  we could chat about the topic before class. I could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking.  [Person1]:  that's a good idea. What should I do if I am in two minds about a topic?  [Person2]:  that's easy. Express possibilities. People will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle.  [Person1]:  I didn't realize that speaking in class could be so easy.  [Person2]:  the most difficult thing is being able to predict what other people will say. They will reply to your statements, but you can't be sure how. 
[Person1]:  Why don't you come round for a meal one evening next week?  [Person2]:  I'd love to.  [Person1]:  Which day would suit you?  [Person2]:  Any day except Tuesday.  [Person1]:  How about Thursday?  [Person2]:  Yes, Thursday would be fine. What time shall I come?  [Person1]:  Oh, about 6 [Person2]:  Yes, of course. Thank you very much.  [Person1]:  See you on Thursday, then. 
[Person1]:  Excuse me, I'd like to try some Chinese food.  [Person2]:  We serve excellent Chinese food. Which style do you prefer?  [Person1]:  I know nothing about Chinese food. Could you give me some suggestions?  [Person2]:  It's divided into 8 big cuisines such as Cantonese food, Shandong food, Sichuan food etc.  [Person1]:  Is there any difference?  [Person2]:  Yes, Cantonese food is lighter while Shandong food is heavier and spicy.  [Person1]:  How about Sichuan food?  [Person2]:  Most Sichuan dishes are spicy and hot. They taste differently.  [Person1]:  Oh, really. I like hot food. So what is your recommendation for me?  [Person2]:  I think Mapo bean curd and shredded meat in chili sauce are quite special and delicious. We have a Sichuan food dining room. May I suggest you to go there? It's on the third floor.  [Person1]:  Thank you.  [Person2]:  It's my pleasure. 
[Person1]:  Good afternoon, sir. May I help you?  [Person2]:  Yes, I'd like a cheeseburger and a large order of French fries.  [Person1]:  Would you like anything to drink with that?  [Person2]:  Yes, a medium Coke.  [Person1]:  Will that be all?  [Person2]:  Yes.  [Person1]:  For here or to go?  [Person2]:  To go, please. (The attendant hands the customer his order. )  [Person1]:  That'll be $4. 25. . . (The customer gives her a 5 dollar bill. ). . . out of five. Here is your change, sir. Have a nice day. 
[Person1]:  Hey Carl, can you make a copy of this contract for me please? When you have it ready, send it out ASAP to our subbranch.  [Person2]:  Sure! Um. . . I think I broke this thing. Maxine, can you help me out here? I'm not really a tech guy.  [Person3]:  Yeah, sure. I think it's just out of toner. You can go use the other one upstairs. On your way up, can you fax this while I try and fix this thing?  [Person2]:  Sure! Damn it! Everything in this office seems to be breaking down! I'll send this stupid fax later. Oh great! Is someone playing a practical joke on me? This is ridiculous!  [Person4]:  The elevator has some sort of malfunction. Just take the stairs dude. What floor are you going to?  [Person2]:  I have to go up fifteen floors! Never mind. 
[Person1]:  Today we are going to discuss how to write better. [Person2]:  Excuse me. [Person1]:  Ah, Tom, you're late again. [Person2]:  I'm sorry, Mrs. Green. [Person1]:  What's the excuse this time? [Person2]:  I must have turned off my alarm clock and gone back to sleep again. [Person1]:  If you had gone to bed earlier, you wouldn't be late for school now. [Person2]:  Last night I did my homework until midnight. [Person1]:  So, where is it? [Person2]:  Oh, I just don't know what to say. I can't tell you how sorry I am. [Person1]:  This is the third time you've been late for my class and the sixth time you forgotten to bring your homework this month. [Person2]:  I'm really sorry. I promise it won't happen again. Please forgive me. [Person1]:  OK. I hope this is the last time. Go to your seat. [Person2]:  Thank you, ma'am.
[Person1]:  Hello Madam, what can I do for you? [Person2]:  My feet hurt. I think I need some new shoes. [Person1]:  What size do you wear? [Person2]:  The last time I bought new shoes was about a year ago, and at that time I was a 7. [Person1]:  Well, once you get to be in your twenties, your feet stop growing. So you're probably still a 7 but let's measure them just in case. [Person2]:  OK, So what does it say? [Person1]:  Well, it looks like you're an eight. No wonder your feet have been hurting you. You've been wearing shoes that are one size too small.
[Person1]:  They're here! Now that's speedy service! And they arrived within two days of each other! [Person2]:  What are you waiting for? Rip ' em open! [Person1]:  Wow... this shirt is nice, but looks big. [Person2]:  It's nice, but how much did you end up paying? [Person1]:  With the shipping included--seventy dollars. [Person2]:  Hmm... not so hot. They sell them here for about that.
[Person1]:  Thank you for calling the Hillside Gallery. How can I help you? [Person2]:  Hello. Is there a photography exhibition this weekend? [Person1]:  Yes, there is. [Person2]:  How much is the ticket? [Person1]:  Tickets for the gallery are 10 pounds and half price for children, but this includes the painting exhibitions, too. If you only want to see the photography exhibition, it's 7 pounds per person, with half price for children, too. [Person2]:  The gallery's on Flower Street, isn't it? [Person1]:  No, we moved to a different building last year. Our present address is 25 Gardenia Road. It's opposite to the Town Square. [Person2]:  Oh, I see. Does the number 25 bus go by it? [Person1]:  Yes, but I suggest you not take a bus or drive here. You will be stuck in a traffic jam at weekends on this street. The underground is easy and fast. [Person2]:  OK. Thank you for your help.
[Person1]:  Telco Mobile, how can I help you? [Person2]:  Yes, I'd like to activate my voice mail service please. [Person1]:  Certainly sir, we currently have a special promotion where we include voice mail services, call waiting and also three way calling. [Person2]:  Sure that sounds great! Are there any other fees? [Person1]:  Not at all. No hidden fees or surcharges, it is a flat monthly rate. [Person2]:  Perfect. I also wanted to know if there is any call forwarding service? I am usually out of town and would like my calls to be forwarded to a local number. [Person1]:  Yes of course. We can activate all these services in about an hour.
[Person1]:  Well, that's it. 7 appointments in Paris at beginning of next week, and 4 in Frankfurt at the end of the week. [Person2]:  It's certainly a tight schedule. [Person1]:  Now it's a question of getting there. I need a flight to Paris on Sunday evening and a hotel in Paris for 3 nights. I have to be in Frankfurt by 11 on Thursday morning. And I will need a hotel for one night. I will head home on Friday. [Person2]:  At what time? [Person1]:  My last appointment is at 3, so I should be free by 5 at the very latest. I think I could get to the airport by 6. [Person2]:  Do you know how far you will be from the airport at 5? [Person1]:  No, not really. [Person2]:  So you are not sure how long it will take to get there? [Person1]:  No, but I am sure it won't take more than an hour. [Person2]:  Don't forget it's Friday nighty. If Frankfurt's anything like London, everybody will be leaving for the weekend. It will be a rush hour and traffic might be moving very slowly. [Person1]:  You are a pessimist. [Person2]:  I am a realist.
[Person1]:  Happy Birthday, Mary! [Person2]:  Thank you. [Person1]:  Here is a gift for you. I hope you like it. [Person2]:  What a lovely dog! How did you know I love things like this? [Person1]:  I had my own ways of finding out. It's a secret. You look so beautiful today. Your new shirt goes well with your skirt. [Person2]:  Maybe you won't believe this, but it was made by my grandmother. [Person1]:  Really? It looks so nice. [Person2]:  Thank you, Please have a cup of tea. [Person1]:  All right. [Person2]:  How about some fish? [Person1]:  No, thanks. I've had enough. Now, Mary, before you blow out the birthday candles, you have to make a wish. After that, you may cut the cake. [Person2]:  OK. Let me make a wish. . . Do you want a big piece of cake? [Person1]:  No, just a small one. Next Let's sing ' Happy Birthday ' to Mary. [Person2]:  It is so very kind of you. I'm so moved by you.
[Person1]:  Please do excuse me for a moment. I've got diarrhea. [Person2]:  It's easy to get loose bowels in summer. [Person1]:  It may have something to do with the food I had last night [Person2]:  You'Ve got to be careful on the food you eat. [Person1]:  I will. Thank you.
[Person1]:  The air quality in this city is horrendous. The pollution levels are so high that we are not supposed to go outside with a face mask again! [Person2]:  Exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment. [Person1]:  On top of that, there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs, which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city. [Person2]:  As much as I love this city, I think I'm going to find a greener city to live in. Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health. [Person1]:  I know what you mean. However, there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming. If it's not the pollution, then it's the natural disasters, deforestation, or the greenhouse effect. [Person2]:  What is the greenhouse effect exactly? [Person1]:  It's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature. [Person2]:  I see, so it's similar to global warming? [Person1]:  They're related to one another, yes. [Person2]:  I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live. [Person1]:  People joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature, but it's not all good news. They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well. [Person2]:  People always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations. [Person1]:  I think if everyone pitches in, the world will be a better place.
[Person1]:  I heard you had rented an apartment of three bedrooms. Are you going to share it with anyone? [Person2]:  Yes. My friends David and Henry will share the apartment with me. The rent is 900 dollars a month. I cannot afford it if I live there alone. [Person1]:  When will you move in? [Person2]:  This Thursday. [Person1]:  It's the day after tomorrow. It's so close. Have you finished packing? [Person2]:  Not yet. I'll do that tomorrow. I don't have much stuff. So it won't take long.
[Person1]:  Hi, I'm Sally. I live in the Apartment 324, right next door. I was wondering if you could do a favor for me. I'm expecting a package to be delivered, but now I have to go to the property manager. Could you sign the package and hold it for me? [Person2]:  Of course. I would be happy to help you out. By the way, I'm John. I moved in here two days ago. It's nice to meet you. [Person1]:  I've been living here for six months. [Person2]:  Would you like to come in for a cup of coffee? [Person1]:  No, thanks. I need to talk to the property manager about some problems with my apartment. [Person2]:  What trouble are you having? [Person1]:  My electric stove gets too hot. I baked a cake yesterday. After only five minutes, the cake was as hard as a brick. I had the temperature set right. [Person2]:  Something must be going wrong with it. You'd better talk to the property manager, and get it repaired as soon as possible. [Person1]:  OK. I have to go now. I really appreciate your help. I'm glad that you moved in next door to me. I'll bake a cake as a housewarming gift as soon as my stove is working. [Person2]:  Sounds great. Well, I'll see you later. [Person1]:  Bye for now.
[Person1]:  Thank you so much for agreeing to meet up with me! [Person2]:  No problem! I bet this whole thing is pretty stressful [Person1]:  Yeah! My parents are asking me all these stupid questions! [Person2]:  Don't worry. You'll be free soon enough! [Person1]:  Cool! So, how did you know what classes to take in the beginning? [Person2]:  Well, I had no idea what I wanted to study when I first got here. I just kind of picked classes that sounded interesting. You can also choose classes based on when they are held so that your schedule flows nicely. [Person1]:  What do you mean? [Person2]:  Well, I'm taking four classes right now, but I only go to school three days a week, so I have four full days off. [Person1]:  Are your classes hard? [Person2]:  Well, there is a lot of information that you are responsible for, and you are expected to work independently. You also have to write a lot of papers for certain classes and participate in class discussions in others-each class is different. The trick is to figure out how to prepare for different kinds of courses. [Person1]:  What about, uh, social life? [Person2]:  I was waiting for that question! I'll tell you what. I'm gonna call up some of my friends, and we can all go out to lunch and talk about it. How does that sound? [Person1]:  Awesome!
[Person1]:  Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? [Person2]:  My name is David and I live in Shanghai. I was born in 1980. My major was electrical engineering. [Person1]:  What kind of personality do you think you have? [Person2]:  Well, I approach things very enthusiastically and I don't like to leave things half done. I'm very organized and most capable. [Person1]:  What would you say are your weaknesses and strengths? [Person2]:  Well, I'm afraid I'm a poor speaker. However, I'm fully aware of this, so I've been studying how to speak in public. I suppose my strengths are that I am persistent and quick to learn. [Person1]:  Do you have any licenses or certificates? [Person2]:  I have a drivers license and I am a CPA. [Person1]:  How do you get along with other people? [Person2]:  I'm very cooperative and have good teamwork skills.
[Person1]:  Come quick, Andrew, it's your favorite basketball match. The Detroit Pistons versus the Los Angeles Lakers. [Person2]:  Great, how long has it been going? [Person1]:  About 5 minutes, the score is 12 to 12. [Person2]:  Oh look, what a nice shot! [Person1]:  You're always so excited while you're watching basketball games. [Person2]:  This is a great match. [Person1]:  Shall I get you a beer? [Person2]:  Sure, thanks. Great. Oh wonderful! A nice shot, look Jane, look. Magic Johnson is so great. [Person1]:  You bet he is.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, is this seat taken? [Person2]:  No, I don't think so. [Person1]:  Thanks. I am waiting for the train at 9 [Person2]:  What a coincidence! We are on the same train. [Person1]:  Really? What is your seat number? [Person2]:  No.5 on the second row, and you? [Person1]:  I am on the third row No.10. [Person2]:  Could you please keep an eye on my luggage? I want to go to the washroom. [Person1]:  No problem. [Person2]:  Thank you so much.
[Person1]:  Hi, my name is Susan. What's your name? [Person2]:  My name is Lin Fang. I'm from China. It's nice to meet you Susan. [Person1]:  Nice to meet you too, Lin Fang. So, are you a new student here? [Person2]:  Yes, I came here just last week. My father is working here and he wants me to study here. So I moved here with my mother about a week ago. It's really exciting to be here. [Person1]:  You speak very good English. I can't believe you've been in America for only about a week. [Person2]:  Well, I attended an international school when I was in China. We had American teachers who taught us English. Have you been to China? [Person1]:  Yes, I traveled to Chengdu with my parents last summer. There was so much to see there. So which city are you from? [Person2]:  Shanghai. [Person1]:  So have you visited Beijing? [Person2]:  Certainly, my uncle and aunt live in Beijing. I used to visit them every summer.
[Person1]:  We haven't got much time left now. There's still so much to see in this museum. [Person2]:  We'll just have to choose one more exhibition. [Person1]:  What about jewelry from the ancient world in Hall 3? [Person2]:  But look at the queue. We'll spend half our time waiting if we go in there. Why not try the rainforest in photos and haul 5? You can wander around and see all the forest animals. [Person1]:  OK, then we won't have time to visit rescue by helicopter. There is a real one in Hall 6. [Person2]:  Maybe next time.
[Person1]:  Thank god you are open! I have an emergency! [Person2]:  Hello, Mr. Henderson what can I do for you? [Person1]:  I need this dress and this suit dry cleaned ASAP! [Person2]:  OK, I can have it ready by the end of the week. [Person1]:  No, you don ' t understand, I need this tomorrow morning! I accidentally spilled beer all over my wife ' s dress and we have a wedding to attend tomorrow! She ' s gonna kill me! [Person2]:  OK, I can have it ready tomorrow afternoon, but this suit is also very stained. I can ' t guarantee we can remove it completely. [Person1]:  Fine! Can you also iron and starch this shirt? [Person2]:  Certainly. [Person1]:  Great! This is our secret! If you see my wife, say nothing to her about this!
[Person1]:  Well, Randy, I'd say you've got a bad case of the flu. The main thing to do is get plenty of rest and drink lots of liquids. I'll prescribe something for that throat. [Person2]:  Thanks, doctor. Is there anything I can take for this headache? [Person1]:  Some aspirin or Panadol should help. You can pick some up at the pharmacy when you go to fill your prescription. [Person2]:  Okay. [Person1]:  Goodbye, Randy. Take care.
[Person1]:  Come on, Dad. The shops will be closed if we don't hurry. [Person2]:  Don't worry and the shops are open until midnight on Christmas Eve. [Person1]:  Yes, but it will take us a long time to find a car park and it will be midnight before we choose a present for mother. Plus, we don't know what to buy for her. Maybe a hat. [Person2]:  No, she is already had so many hats. [Person1]:  Well, maybe a box of chocolates. [Person2]:  But she never eats them. Anything else is OK. You know, she will be satisfied with what you buy for her.
[Person1]:  The weather is terrible. [Person2]:  Yeah. It's been raining a lot these days. [Person1]:  I have been watching a lot of videos at home because of the constant rain. [Person2]:  Have you heard when it's supposed to get better? [Person1]:  I saw the weather report, and it's going to rain for the next eight days. [Person2]:  That sucks so much. What are we going to do? [Person1]:  I'm getting pretty bored. We should do something despite the rain. [Person2]:  I'm with you. What do you have in mind? [Person1]:  I haven't been to the Mall in a long time. Let's go there. [Person2]:  That sounds good. They have a movie theatre there, so if we get bored, we can watch a movie. [Person1]:  Great. I'll stop by your place now. [Person2]:  Ok. Don't forget to bring your umbrella. The rain can start up again anytime.
[Person1]:  How many cleaning ladies does your company hire? [Person2]:  We have two cleaning ladies. But both of them have received little education. [Person1]:  Most cleaning ladies are illiterate. But some of them do a very nice job. [Person2]:  But I actually dislike another lady. She is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own. But the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us. She would tell you what to do and where to put things.
[Person1]:  Scientists have found a second solar system in the universe. [Person2]:  What's the second solar system? [Person1]:  It's just a system like ours, with a star and a number of planets going around it. [Person2]:  Is this good news or bad news? [Person1]:  It's exciting news! If we find a second solar system, we might find a second earth! [Person2]:  You mean with people on it? [Person1]:  Yes! Isn't that exciting?
[Person1]:  How is your English ability? [Person2]:  Not bad. I'm proficient in both written and spoken English. [Person1]:  English and computer skills are comparatively important to this position, especially in the starting period. What's your ability in these two fields? [Person2]:  I passed College English Test Band 6, with good skill in listening, speaking, reading, and writing. I haven't got any certificate of computer skills, because I don't think certificates are necessary if what's needed is merely operating a computer. I think practically, to know how to use a computer is more important. And I am quite familiar with Microsoft Office. [Person1]:  What else do you have to prove your English ability? [Person2]:  I took a part-time job last semester in translating and doing reception work for an exhibition. My work included hosting the visiting foreign exhibitors, communicating with them, arranging their agenda, and translating several materials. I think this activity well demonstrated my ability in English. And I will be glad to take any form of English test you arrange for me to prove my ability. [Person1]:  How do you deal with those who you think are difficult to work with? [Person2]:  I stick to my principles and keep to the rules. Sometimes, they just lack enthusiasm. When I get them involved with something constructive, some of them change their attitude later. [Person1]:  Yes, I see.
[Person1]:  Who's that? [Person2]:  Saint Jude-he's the saint of lost causes. Like my cousin, Anna, who can't stop getting pregnant. She's a lost cause. [Person1]:  Is that your cousin in the back? [Person2]:  Yep. She's always got a bun in the oven. She was pregnant before marriage-a real sin in the Catholic Church. [Person1]:  What about birth control pills? Don't they work on Italians? [Person2]:  Ha-ha. Birth control and abortion are four-letter words in my family. [Person1]:  And I heard that Italian men have very active libidos.
[Person1]:  What are the requirements to apply for the position? [Person2]:  Your major must be computer. [Person1]:  Do you think my educational background suits this position? [Person2]:  Yes, I'm quite satisfied with your qualifications. [Person1]:  Does this job require that new employees take any kind of training course? [Person2]:  Generally speaking, training new members is usually necessary. We offer our new employees a one-week training course. [Person1]:  Could you tell something about the job? [Person2]:  Yes, of course. You will be responsible for the designing and developing new products and also be in charge of the evaluation of the software programs including complex software systems to ensure product features and operation complaints. [Person1]:  Oh, I see. I believe I can do the job well.
[Person1]:  And how would you describe yourself, Miss Tao? What kind of person are you? [Person2]:  Well, as I mentioned before, I think I am easy-going. I enjoy working and talking with people and I'm a responsible person. [Person1]:  Did you have any difficulty getting along with fellow students or teachers? [Person2]:  No. Not at all. I'm quite easy-going. [Person1]:  What's your strong points? [Person2]:  Oh, I'm very responsible, I can make fast decisions, and I do not need much supervision. I enjoy completing challenging tasks. [Person1]:  What do you dislike most about your job? [Person2]:  Probably routine, dull work. Oh, I am much more enthusiastic if I'm given a challenge and responsibility. [Person1]:  What kind of relationship do you think should exist between a supervisor and employee? [Person2]:  A friendly one. I think an open, friendly, honest relationship should exist. An employee should feel she ( he ) can go to her ( his ) boss anytime with any kind of question. [Person1]:  Sometimes working with a foreign company can be stressful. Foreigners tend to get excited or angry easily, and they show it. Are you sure you can handle this stress? How do you deal with conflict in your present job? [Person2]:  Well, there's a lot of stress in a Chinese company also, although much of it is below the surface. I have confidence in my ability to handle conflict. If I have a problem with a co-worker, I do everything I can to work it out directly with that person. If I am unable to work it out, then I ask a supervisor to help out. If my boss shouts at me, I try not to take it personally. I try my best to understand the stress he is under. It's kind of like being in a family. Often family members say things in the heat of the moment, but don't mean what they say. A company is like a family, it has good times and bad times. [Person1]:  How do you feel about overtime work? [Person2]:  That's no problem. I know that every company has busy periods. When this happens, I'm ready to put in as much time as necessary to get the job done. [Person1]:  What is most important to you in a job? [Person2]:  I want to feel that I am making a real contribution to the company, so I would like my boss to trust me with important work. [Person1]:  Do you think that you are introverted or extroverted? [Person2]:  I'm quite outspoken. I enjoy calling a spade a spade and hate talking in a roundabout way. So I'd call myself outgoing. [Person1]:  Under what kind of circumstance will you lose your temper? [Person2]:  Seldom. But I hate someone's frequently being late or lazy. [Person1]:  OK. What are your strong points? [Person2]:  Hmm. as I mentioned, I can work well under pressure and I enjoy work that challenges me. I think that my English ability is also a strong point. [Person1]:  And your weaknesses? [Person2]:  I think I sometimes try to be over-organized. So I am learning how to let some things go and concentrate on the most important part of my job.
[Person1]:  What will I earn per year in this job? [Person2]:  You can expect to earn sixty-five thousand dollars per year. [Person1]:  Are we covered by a good benefits plan? [Person2]:  The job has a menu plan where you are given a fixed amount of money and you choose what you most need in terms of benefits. [Person1]:  Can we take personal days off? [Person2]:  You get 2 weeks paid vacation and an additional 10 days of sick leave. [Person1]:  What do you offer in terms of a retirement plan? [Person2]:  We do not currently offer any retirement plan. [Person1]:  Do you reimburse for education that relates to my job? [Person2]:  We allow several weeks release time each year for our employees to attend job-related seminars and conferences. [Person1]:  Do you have a benefits brochure? [Person2]:  Whoa! Who said you got the job?
[Person1]:  So what kind of job did you find for the summer? [Person2]:  I'm working for a marketing company. I'm doing telephone marketing. [Person1]:  Oh. So you are one of those people who drive me crazy by calling me up and trying to persuade me to buy something that I have no need for. Do you like it? [Person2]:  Believe it or not. I do. There are a lot of students working there, and we have a lot of fun when we're not making calls. It's really easy, since we just have to read from a text. [Person1]:  Are you doing this full time? [Person2]:  Yeah, but I work from two in the afternoon until eleven at night, so I can sleep as late as I want to in the morning.
[Person1]:  Is that Ann? [Person2]:  Yes. [Person1]:  This is Mike. How are things with you? [Person2]:  Oh, very well, but I'm very busy. [Person1]:  Busy? But you've finished all your exams? [Person2]:  Yes, but I have to help my little sister with her foreign language. [Person1]:  How about coming out with me this evening? There's a new film on. [Person2]:  I'm afraid I can't. A friend of mine is coming from the south and I have to go to the station to meet him. [Person1]:  What a pity! How about the weekend then? [Person2]:  No, I've arranged to go to an art exhibition with my parents. [Person1]:  What about next week sometime? [Person2]:  Maybe.
[Person1]:  Hi Alice, what are you doing? You look worried. [Person2]:  Oh. There's something wrong with my electronic calculator. [Person1]:  Do you want me to have a look at it? [Person2]:  It's very kind of you, but I would like to have a try first. Er... You know... I can do without it in class this afternoon. [Person1]:  Oh, well, if you need any help, just let me know. I'm free after school. [Person2]:  I will. Thank you very much. [Person1]:  You're welcome.
[Person1]:  hi, betty!  [Person2]:  hi, andy, how are you finding your new job?  [Person1]:  pretty good. My colleagues seem alright. So far everything is great.  [Person2]:  that's nice. What do they have you doing over there?  [Person1]:  well, I work in the marketing department. The corporate culture is totally different from my last employer. Before, when I was assigned a task, I was totally on my own but here most of the work is don  [Person2]:  that' s really good. It's very important to feel like you are part of the team at work.  [Person1]:  indeed. Team work is highly valued in this new company. I like our boss too. He is easy to get along with treats everybody with respect and appreciation. He's highly respected by all his employees.  [Person2]:  that's great, that's good for a positive work environment and helps motivate employees. I wish my boss was like that.  [Person1]:  true, take my former supervisor as an example. He was extremely controlling and overbearing. He always had to micromanage everything.  [Person2]:  well, now you don't have to worry about that. This new place sounds really good.  [Person1]:  yeah it is. 
[Person1]:  Are you sure Lucy has it bad for you? If she does, she will certainly bend over backwards for you. But if she doesn't, it would be a job to change her.  [Person2]:  I don't know whether she has it bad for me, but she enjoys being with me.  [Person1]:  And do you really love her?  [Person2]:  I think I do. I don't think I can be happier with another girl. 
[Person1]:  Tom, why are you surfing the net again? It's a real waste of time I've told you. [Person2]:  I'm doing my homework, mom. I need to write a paper and I'm looking for the information on the net. [Person1]:  Really? [Person2]:  Yes. You see, you can find a lot of information by entering the keywords and searching for them. [Person1]:  That's fantastic. [Person2]:  And the net can also help you do shopping. It's called e-shopping. [Person1]:  How can I do shopping without going to the shops? [Person2]:  It's easy. First, you log on to an online shopping delivery service, which will give you the pictures of different goods. Then you simply point and click around the screen for the goods you want. The goods will be sent to you. [Person1]:  I can't believe it. Let me have a try. [Person2]:  It can save you a lot of time.
[Person1]:  Hello, welcome to the Daily Grind. What can I get for you? [Person2]:  Good morning, I actually have no idea what I want to drink today. Any recommendations? [Person1]:  Do you drink your coffee black? Or do you prefer to add cream, sugar or milk to it? [Person2]:  I definitely do not drink it black. The taste is so strong. [Person1]:  OK, well, then, do you like sweet coffee? [Person2]:  I guess so. To be honest, I'm not much of a coffee drinker. I've always been more of a tea drinker. But lately my friends have all started going out for coffee and juice. I feel like a fool when it is time to order, because I have no idea what to get. [Person1]:  Come in right up. You can pick up your drink at the end of the bar. Have a great day. [Person2]:  Thanks for your help. Where is your tip jar? [Person1]:  Down at the end of the counter with the drinks. [Person2]:  Great. Have a great day.
[Person1]:  What's wrong with the bus? I have waited nearly an hour. [Person2]:  So have I, it's so cold. The weatherman said it's going to snow around 5 to 7 inches. [Person1]:  So what? Last night, the weather report said the snow would last only one hour, but actually it snowed about 3 hours. [Person2]:  I agree with you. Anyway, the weather changes so much, if it snows today, all stay at home tomorrow. [Person1]:  Oh, you're so lucky. I have to work as usual. I just work in the white building over there. [Person2]:  Really? We work in the same building. [Person1]:  It sounds good. Why don't we have a drink in the coffee shop while waiting for the bus? [Person2]:  Good idea.
[Person1]:  Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? [Person2]:  I am a graduate of a technical university and have been employed as a technician with Company or approximately 10 years. [Person1]:  Please explain why you are interested in leaving your current position and please elaborate on your technical skills. [Person2]:  I am looking for a growth opportunity, which I feel is not available at my current employer. In terms of skills, I am Microsoft certified in Windows XP and several other operating system [Person1]:  Where do you see yourself five years from now? [Person2]:  I see myself in a management position.
[Person1]:  Would you like your bags to be taken to your room? [Person2]:  Yes, please. [Person1]:  OK. I'll get the bellman to taka them up. Which bags are yours? [Person2]:  My luggage is in the corner over there. They are the leather suitcase, the canvass holdall and the blue backpack. [Person1]:  OK. [Person2]:  Please be careful with the suitcase, it's very heavy. [Person1]:  I'll let the bellboy know. Don't worry, he's very strong. [Person2]:  And the holdall has some fragile items inside, so please be careful with that too. [Person1]:  Of course.
[Person1]:  Sorry. What was that you said? [Person2]:  I'll meet you at the Gate round about seven. [Person1]:  Where? [Person2]:  At the Gate. [Person1]:  When, did you say? [Person2]:  Round about seven. [Person1]:  Who's coming? [Person2]:  Peter. Peter Brown, you know. Don't forget to bring the letter. [Person1]:  Sorry. I didn't quite catch what you said. There's a lot of noise outside. [Person2]:  I told you not to forget to bring the letter. [Person1]:  Loretta? No, she can't come, she's busy.
[Person1]:  Hi, Mr. Brown, we have visited the factories and I'm very satisfied with your factories production conditions. [Person2]:  Yes, they are our main export bases of tools with the advantage of having good production experience and long historical record. All their products enjoy high prestige in the world market. [Person1]:  That's very good. But I have little knowledge about the packing of your pliers. I just want to know the details about that. [Person2]:  Ok, I'll show you how the packing is like. We have a showroom on the ground floor. Let's go downstairs and have a look. [Person1]:  Sure. [Person2]:  These are the various kinds of packing for pliers. Normally, we have three types of packing [Person1]:  Oh, the packing looks very nice. [Person2]:  The skin packing is the most advanced packing for this product in the world market. It catches the eyes and can help push sales. [Person1]:  Good, what about the export packing? [Person2]:  Well, they are packed in boxes of two dozens each, 100 boxes to a wooden case. [Person1]:  Is the wooden case strong enough for transportation? You see, 100 boxes of pliers are very heavy. It's about 2, 400 kilograms. [Person2]:  You can rest assured of that. So far, no customers have complained about our outer packing. [Person1]:  I'm glad to hear that. By the way, do you accept neutral packing? [Person2]:  Yes, we can pack the goods according to your instructions. [Person1]:  Very good. Ok, Mr. Brown, I'm now totally satisfied with your packing. You can execute our first order now, and I will open the L / C immediately after I return to Taipei. [Person2]:  All right. We'll make the shipment as soon as your L / C is on hand.
[Person1]:  Wake up sleepyhead. The sun is beginning to shine. What a lovely summer day! [Person2]:  Yeah, clearly blue sky. But it is a bit too hot for me. I don't like heat and humidity. [Person1]:  It's not that hot. It's cooler than yesterday. Let's go swimming! [Person2]:  That's a thought. It's still early, and the beach isn't crowded at this time of the day. If we don't stay too long, we won't get sunburned. [Person1]:  Yeah, sounds like fun. I can wear my new pink bikini. [Person2]:  There won't be anyone there to appreciate how cute you are. [Person1]:  Who cares! Well, the smart guys get there early. That's the kind of guy I want to meet. Let's go! [Person2]:  If you are going to husband hunting in a bikini, then I want to wear one, too. [Person1]:  Ok, you could borrow one of mine. [Person2]:  Thanks, how about the green and black one? [Person1]:  No problem. Here it is.
[Person1]:  There is a new coffee shop opening up down the street. [Person2]:  I hope that they have a good menu. Most coffee shops only have coffee and Danish. [Person1]:  That's right. You don't drink coffee, do you? [Person2]:  No, so it's usually boring to join my friends in the afternoon at a regular coffee shop. [Person1]:  What kind of things would you like to see on the menu? [Person2]:  Maybe a fruit salad and a few different hot sandwiches at least. [Person1]:  That shouldn't be too difficult. Since this is a small neighborhood, maybe they will take this suggestion. [Person2]:  Let's try it!
[Person1]:  I hate to say goodbye, but it's late. [Person2]:  Can't you stay for a little bit longer, it's only 8. [Person1]:  I wish I could. But I'm afraid I can't. I've got some serious studying to do. I have to go. [Person2]:  OK. See you on Today. [Person1]:  See you on Moday. Have a great weekend. [Person2]:  You too. Thanks for dropping in.
[Person1]:  Did you hear what happened to Mike in Accounts? [Person2]:  No. What? [Person1]:  He got arrested on Friday night and spent the night in jail. [Person2]:  No. Really, what happened? [Person1]:  Well, it was all a big mistake, actually. He got home on Friday night really late, and apparently he'd been out drinking with some clients, so he was really drunk. [Person2]:  Was he out with the guys from the bank? [Person1]:  Yes, I think so. [Person2]:  Oh, yeah, they always get really drunk. [Person1]:  Well, anyway, he'd somehow lost his wallet and his house keys, so he couldn't get in. He lives alone, you know. [Person2]:  Oh, really. I thought he lived with his wife. [Person1]:  No, she left him last year. [Person2]:  Oh, really? Do you know why? [Person1]:  Hang on, let me finish telling you what happened. Where was I? [Person2]:  He lost his wallet and keys. [Person1]:  Oh yes, well, he tried to climb in through the bathroom window, but apparently he slipped and broke the glass with his foot. The neighbors heard him and thought a robbery was in progress, so they called the police. [Person2]:  Oh, no. [Person1]:  Yes. So when the cops arrived, they didn't believe his story [Person2]:  So then what happened? [Person1]:  Well, when he sobered up, he called someone from work to come and bail him out. [Person2]:  Well, that's a bit of a tricky situation. [Person1]:  Yes, I know.
[Person1]:  Are you sure Lucy has it bad for you? If she does, she will certainly bend over backwards for you. But if she doesn't, it would be a job to change her. [Person2]:  I don't know whether she has it bad for me, but she enjoys being with me. [Person1]:  And do you really love her? [Person2]:  I think I do. I don't think I can be happier with another girl.
[Person1]:  Hello. Today I'm interviewing Joshua on his experiences going to a Japanese school. Now Joshua, what time do you go to school? [Person2]:  Eight O'clock. [Person1]:  Eight O'clock. And do you go by yourself, or on a school bus? [Person2]:  No, I have a group that goes with me. [Person1]:  So you go with a group? [Person2]:  Uh-huh. [Person1]:  Now what kinds of things do you take to school? [Person2]:  I take my taiso fuku, that is gym clothes, and I take my backpack and my books [ Oh, okay. ] and stuff like that. [Person1]:  Okay and what is the first thing you do when you get to school? [Person2]:  We do 'kiritsu, rei.' [Person1]:  'Kiritsu' and 'rei.' Now what are those? [Person2]:  It means 'stand up, bow.' [Person1]:  Stand up and bow. [Person2]:  Uh-huh. [Person1]:  And what do you study at school? [Person2]:  We study kokugo, that is writing and reading and stuff like that [ Okay ], and sansu, that's math. [ Okay. ]. And, let's see ..., we do gym too. [Person1]:  Okay, and where do you eat lunch? Do you have a lunchroom or cafeteria? [Person2]:  No, we eat in our classroom. [Person1]:  You eat in your classroom! [ Yeah. ]. Oh wow. That is very interesting. Now what time do you come home from school? [Person2]:  We come home sometimes at 3 [Person1]:  Okay, well thank you very much Joshua. [Person2]:  You're welcome.
[Person1]:  Oh, man. What happened here? [Person2]:  What's wrong? [Person1]:  Someone ran a pen through the dryer, and now all of my clothes AND the dryer are a real mess. [Person2]:  Ugh. Wow. That's rough. Well, I have to go. I'm playing tennis with Jacob in a few minutes. [Person1]:  NO! No way! Wait, wait. What about the mess? [Person2]:  Well, uh, what clothes did you have in there? [Person1]:  I had two of my ... [Person2]:  They weren't mine?! Uh ... [Person1]:  Listen. I had two of my new shirts, a pair of shorts, and some running socks, and one of your work shirts. [Person2]:  No way! [Person1]:  And from the looks of the pen stain, you are the one who probably left a pen in your pocket from work. [Person2]:  Oooh. Uh ... [Person1]:  Yeah. [Person2]:  How do you know? [Person1]:  Here's the pen, and it has your company logo on it. [Person2]:  Oh. Uh ... [Person1]:  So, look, here. Here's your phone. [Person2]:  My phone? For what? [Person1]:  Call your friends and tell them you're going to be late. And try using this hairspray. It'll help get the ink stains out of the dryer. [Person2]:  Oohhh. Well, yeah, I guess it was my fault. Um, how about if I take you to buy some new clothes after I get back? [Person1]:  Okay. I'd appreciate that, but please, be more careful next time. [Person2]:  Okay. Sorry. [Person1]:  Love ya.
[Person1]:  Hello, this is Jonason speaking. [Person2]:  Hello, Jonason, I am Kasy. I am sorry to tell you that I may not attend your birthday party this weekend. [Person1]:  Oh, what's up? [Person2]:  Nothing much.., but... [Person1]:  What's happened then? [Person2]:  I have an important exam at that time. [Person1]:  If so, I think we can hold the party ahead of time. What do you think about it? [Person2]:  Yeah, It is a good idea. I can't agree more. [Person1]:  Great and I wish you success. [Person2]:  Thank you, happy birthday to you.
[Person1]:  I'm afraid I can't show you the apartment at the moment, because the tenant is still living in it. It's really a lovely place, with a big kitchen and a sunny window, for only two hundred dollars a month. [Person2]:  Sounds good, but we really can't rent an apartment without seeing it first.
[Person1]:  I am so happy to know that the promotion campaign for our new product is very successful. We just made a record sale this season.  [Person2]:  That is very encouraging news. I heard that the marketing department has done a three months research, they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month. That is to say, the R&D center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market.  [Person1]:  It is not an easy job. How do you like the advertisement for the new product?  [Person2]:  That is the best one I have seen. I am sure our target customers, young people will love it.  [Person1]:  Certainly. 
[Person1]:  What's your favorite movie?  [Person2]:  My favorite movie is Superbad.  [Person1]:  Oh, why is that?  [Person2]:  It's the funniest movie that I've ever seen.  [Person1]:  That's true. It is a very funny movie.  [Person2]:  You've seen it before?  [Person1]:  Yes, I saw that movie the first day it came out in theaters.  [Person2]:  Didn't you laugh through the whole movie? I did.  [Person1]:  Me too. That movie brought tears to my eyes.  [Person2]:  Mine too.  [Person1]:  I have it on DVD at my house if you want to come over and watch it.  [Person2]:  Sure, let's go. 
[Person1]:  Now we have five-day classes every week, so we have more spare time than before. [Person2]:  How do you spend your time, Timmy? [Person1]:  I have interest in playing the violin and I'll continue to practice playing it. [Person2]:  Do you often take part in a concert? [Person1]:  Yes, I like to listen to some music. At present, my major objective is to learn from others. [Person2]:  Do you like classical music or pop? [Person1]:  I like both. How do you spend your spare time then, Lily? [Person2]:  Playing the piano is my favorite activity. [Person1]:  Our hobbies are similar to each other. I hope we can often exchange experience together. [Person2]:  So do I. But I am weak in the theory of music. [Person1]:  Me too. Would you like to go with me to visit my uncle? He's a professor of the institute of music. [Person2]:  I'm glad to go with you. I would ask him for his advice.
[Person1]:  What's wrong with you? You look disappointed. [Person2]:  I am. I was surfing the web and my computer crashed again. Yesterday I couldn't get my word processing program to run. It's driving me crazy. [Person1]:  Did you lose any work when it crashed? [Person2]:  Nothing important. I backed up everything on disk. But I'm such a fool when it comes to computers. I can't understand. [Person1]:  Don't say so, please. You are a brain but you don't have gotten advanced computer, you know? It's not surprising that you have problems with it. Can you start it again? [Person2]:  I can't, Myron. It's like being totally crashed. I also asked Ron about it, but he didn't have time to help. [Person1]:  Do you want me to take a look at it for you? Maybe I can find the problem. [Person2]:  Would you? That would be great. You are the baddest man around, Myron. [Person1]:  Thanks, I think.
[Person1]:  Come on, why do you stop your car here? It's still a long way from the town. [Person2]:  I didn't stop the car. The car stopped itself. Let me have a look and find out what the matter is. [Person1]:  Is it out of gas? It was running so well. [Person2]:  Out of gas? Yeah, it's possible. Oh, yes, it is. [Person1]:  But there is no one around and not a building in sight. How can we get some gas? [Person2]:  Don't worry. Just stand by the road. Wave your hands when the next car comes. We are sure to get some gas from others. [Person1]:  It's getting dark. I'm afraid we can't get to the town before dark. [Person2]:  Take it easy. We are sure to get to the town and spend our night in a comfortable hotel.
[Person1]:  Our Afghan customers wanna buy China's tea. I am thinking of placing an order with you. [Person2]:  Which tea do you prefer, black or jasmine tea? [Person1]:  I like both. Could you show me some samples? [Person2]:  Of course, here you are. These are Black tea from Anti, Oolong tea from Guangdong, Oolong tea from Fujisan and Longing tea from Xinu. The new products are Curls Black tea, Crushed Black tea and so on. They are the best sellers in many countries. [Person1]:  Oh, such a variety. All of them are excellent both in color and flavour. No wonder our people like China ' s tea better than any other kind. Could you give me some idea of the prices? [Person2]:  Here is our price list. All the prices on the list are subject to our final confirmation. You can see the prices are reasonable. [Person1]:  I'd like you to quote me CIF Karachi. [Person2]:  Right. Could you tell us the quantity you require so that we can work out the offer? [Person1]:  Yes. I want 500 kilograms of Black tea from Anti, 200 kilograms of Jasmine tea from Hangzhou and 100 kilograms of Crushed Black tea, first grade. [Person2]:  Good. We will make the offer tomorrow afternoon. Is that all right? [Person1]:  Yes. See you tomorrow afternoon.
[Person1]:  It seems that something is praying heavy on you. What's the matter?  [Person2]:  I got my father's goat last night.  [Person1]:  What did you do to get his goat?  [Person2]:  When I asked him to treat me like he does to my sisters, he jumped down my throat. So I took it out on him by telling him what I thought. 
[Person1]:  what's the matter with you? You look so upset and tired. [Person2]:  My father failed in business. [Person1]:  Oh, that's really tough. [Person2]:  Maybe it is the most difficult period of my family have experienced. [Person1]:  I can understand. By the way, is there anyway I can help? [Person2]:  No, not now. I have found a part-time job. So perhaps I can help my family to come over the difficulties. [Person1]:  Oh, that's so great, bless you! if you need me, I'll always be there. [Person2]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  Hi, Mark, did you catch the game last night? [Person2]:  No, I was out. Was it worth watching? [Person1]:  You didn't hear? Spain won, two to zero. [Person2]:  Oh, really? So, Spain is through to the next round? [Person1]:  Yeah. The final is next week. You have to watch it.
[Person1]:  What can I do for you? [Person2]:  I would like to use the copy machine. [Person1]:  The machine is over there. [Person2]:  Do I have to pay to use the machine? [Person1]:  Yes, you will have to pay to use it. [Person2]:  How much? [Person1]:  It costs ten cents a copy. [Person2]:  Am I limited to a certain number of copies? [Person1]:  You can copy as much as you'd like. [Person2]:  Could you show me how to use the copier? [Person1]:  The instructions for the copier are posted on it. [Person2]:  That's fabulous. Thank you.
[Person1]:  I can't decide what to do today. [Person2]:  Well. Let's go swimming. [Person1]:  Don't you think it's a bit cold for that? [Person2]:  Then why don't we go for a walk in the hills. It'd be very good for us you know.
[Person1]:  Can you believe the headlines? [Person2]:  What are you reading? [Person1]:  I'm reading about Michael Milliken, the Bond King. [Person2]:  Didn't he sell worthless stocks to people or something? He got arrested for that, didn't he? [Person1]:  He got arrested all right. [Person2]:  If I remember, he got off with a light sentence. Something like three years in a minimum-security prison. [Person1]:  Yup, that's him. He made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless. [Person2]:  I think the government fined him a small amount, and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts. He's still a millionaire. [Person1]:  That's the kind of thing in America that gets me mad. Some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail. [Person2]:  I know. And some poor guy that robs a liquor store makes $ 500 at most and ends up in jail for five to ten years. [Person1]:  Yup, you got it. Criminals in America do a lot better if they're white-collar thieves. [Person2]:  So what's Michael Milliken up to these days? [Person1]:  He's giving lectures on business at colleges.
[Person1]:  How is your job search 1 going, Janet? [Person2]:  I found the ideal position. I'm working for a plumbing company. [Person1]:  Are you serious? You studied mathematics at college for four years, and now you have a job working with your hands! [Person2]:  Plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge, and creativity. I love this job. [Person1]:  I can see that. But I didn't know you had experience in that line of work. [Person2]:  I didn't, but I applied for an apprenticeship, and since I studied math, AND I have a good attitude for that my application was accepted. [Person1]:  Congratulations! You do have the right attitude.
[Person1]:  I really want to switch things up. [Person2]:  What were you thinking? [Person1]:  I think I want to try a new style. [Person2]:  What would you like me to do? [Person1]:  I want you to cut my hair shorter. [Person2]:  How short? [Person1]:  I want my hair to be only a few inches long. [Person2]:  Do you really want it that short? [Person1]:  Yes, I've been wanting it short for a while now. [Person2]:  If you really want me to, then I'll do it. [Person1]:  I'm absolutely sure that this is what I want. [Person2]:  Let's do it.
[Person1]:  Hi, Mary. We haven't seen each other since we graduated. Where have you been? [Person2]:  I have been to Australia. Do you still live there? [Person1]:  Oh, no. We have just moved into the new house. [Person2]:  Really? Congratulations. [Person1]:  Thank you, and we want to buy a new television. [Person2]:  What kind of television do you want to buy? [Person1]:  A color TV, of course, but I'm not sure about the size. Maybe we should buy a bigger one. If we buy a smaller one, we might have to change it in a few years' time for a bigger one. That would be a waste of money. What is your opinion? [Person2]:  In my opinion, I don't think it's necessary to buy a very big one. [Person1]:  Any reason? [Person2]:  Yes. As I know, your sitting room isn't big enough. If you put in a very big television, that will be bad for your eyes, and a smaller size TV can also pick up good programs. [Person1]:  Mmm, that's quite true. I'll think about it. [Person2]:  You'd better make a quick decision because the price may go up soon.
[Person1]:  Well, Christmas is almost here. So, what do you want from Santa this year? [Person2]:  A toy car and walkie-talkies. [Person1]:  Really? Well, and what about you, Emily? What do you want for Christmas? [Person3]:  If I can't have a Barbie radio, um, I would have some fragile dolls. And if I can't have some fragile dolls, it doesn't really matter what I get. [Person1]:  Wow. Well, I'm excited, and Santa is coming. And how is Santa going to get inside the house, Micky? [Person2]:  Um, go down the chimney ... [Person1]:  Okay, so he's going to go down the chimney, and should we prepare anything for Santa? [Person2]:  Yeah! [Person1]:  What are we going to prepare for him, Emily? [Person3]:  Um. We could prepare some cookies for him and some hot chocolate, and, um, we could give Rudolph some, um, hot chocolate in a bowl and a cookie. And we could give some of the reindeer some cookies and some hot chocolate in a bowl. [Person1]:  Well, what do you think? They, Um, reindeer probably don't eat cookies, but what else could we give them, Micky? [Person2]:  Um, apples. [Person1]:  Ah, that's good. And, uh ... [Person3]:  Oranges and bananas. [Person1]:  Okay and what time do you think we should go to bed? [Person3]:  Um, seven. [Person1]:  About seven o'clock. Well, that's exciting. I'm really happy that Christmas is coming.
[Person1]:  Morning. Gail. Did you enjoy your holiday in the country? [Person2]:  Yes. We had a great time. And some friends went along with us. [Person1]:  Where did you stay? In a hotel? [Person2]:  No, we camped in the mountains. We cooked all our meals over an open fire. [Person1]:  Sounds great! Was the weather good? [Person2]:  Yes, the sun shone every day and it didn't rain at all. [Person1]:  Did you like the people there? [Person2]:  Yes, they were friendly. We met some farmers and had tea in their houses. [Person1]:  I hope I have chance to go there for my holiday. [Person2]:  It is really a good chance.
[Person1]:  Do you have any direct flight to New Zealand? [Person2]:  Sorry, we don't. But I think you can fly on Northwest 212 to Tokyo and they have a connecting flight on Japan Airline 123 to Auckland, New Zealand's gateway city. And it is the most economical flight, just $580. [Person1]:  When does the flight 212 leave? [Person2]:  At 11 [Person1]:  How long will it stay in Chicago? [Person2]:  Less than one hour. [Person1]:  And how long do I have to stay in Tokyo for the connecting flight? [Person2]:  Not so long, just one hour. [Person1]:  So the time for the whole journey is about ... [Person2]:  About 11 hours. [Person1]:  Let me count. OK. It works out for my time schedule. Thanks a lot. [Person2]:  You are welcome.
[Person1]:  In England today, our schools mixed or single sexed. [Person2]:  Well. There are both. 50 years ago, all schools used to be single sexed. I mean boys only or girls only. Then in the nineteen seventies, many schools changed and became mixed. [Person1]:  Do parents still prefer mixed schools? [Person2]:  No, things have changed. Today, many parents, especially parents of girls think that their children get a better education in single sex schools. [Person1]:  Why do girls do better in single sex schools? [Person2]:  Because girls learn to be more self confident and less worried about their appearance. [Person1]:  What about boys? [Person2]:  Well today, many parents of boys want to send them to mixed schools, they think that the girls will be a positive influence on boys. [Person1]:  So a generally speaking, who does better in mixed schools? [Person2]:  Oh, the girls. They get better exam results than boys.
[Person1]:  Where did you go to school? [Person2]:  I went to university in New York and studied computer, and then I went to a business school in Sydney and stayed there for 2 years. [Person1]:  OK, but you grew up in the UK, right? [Person2]:  Well, kind of. I was born in London but moved to New York with my family when I was 6. My dad got a job there. [Person1]:  What did your father do? [Person2]:  He was a teacher.
[Person1]:  Mr. Lee, I was wondering if you and your wife had plans for next Friday night? [Person2]:  Yes, I think we might be free. What did you have in mind? [Person1]:  I've mailed a formal written invitation to your home inviting you to a dinner party at my home. [Person2]:  That sounds great. Is it casual? [Person1]:  Actually, we thought it would be fun to have a formal sit-down dinner for the holidays. [Person2]:  That sounds good. It will give my wife a chance to dress up. [Person1]:  Yes, we've invited four other couples, so it should be a good mix of people. [Person2]:  That sounds wonderful. Will there be anyone there that I know? [Person1]:  Oh yes, everyone we are inviting is from our company. [Person2]:  Great! I'll look forward to it. We'll make sure and check the mail for our invitation.
[Person1]:  Hello, this is Easy Life real estate. May I help you? [Person2]:  Hello. My name is Bob Brown. I'm hoping you can help me find a place to live in. [Person1]:  OK. First, please tell me what you're looking for, a house or an apartment? [Person2]:  An apartment. I can't afford a house. [Person1]:  Alright. And how many bedrooms do you need, 1, 2 or 3? [Person2]:  I don't want to share it with anybody. So one bedroom is enough for me. [Person1]:  Right. And are you looking for the apartment with furniture or without? [Person2]:  I'd like it to have furniture because I don't have any. Oh, I want it to be in the south of the city and near the subway station. [Person1]:  OK. The last thing is how much you're able to pay? [Person2]:  I can pay about $80 a week. [Person1]:  OK. I'll call you as soon as there is such an apartment for you.
[Person1]:  We have settled the question of price, quality and quantity. Now I am calling to talk about the terms of payment. What are your terms of payment? [Person2]:  Well. We only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable L \ C, payable against shipping documents. [Person1]:  I see. Payment by LC is the safest method, but could you make an exception and accept DA or DP? [Person2]:  I'm afraid not. That is our usual practice, because we are sure we will get the right amount of money that way. [Person1]:  What about the cost of delivery? [Person2]:  We would like to do it in accordance with an F. O. B.
[Person1]:  It's time for bed. [Person2]:  But I'm not sleepy, Mum. Can I stay and watch more TV? [Person1]:  It's already half past eleven. You have school tomorrow. You'll sleepy all tomorrow, if you don't sleep well tonight. [Person2]:  I know. But I promise I won't be sleepy tomorrow. I work really hard. [Person1]:  Don't you have the exams coming up soon? I'm sure you could spend more time preparing for those. [Person2]:  Oh, I nearly forgot the exams. [Person1]:  You do well in maths, but your history is not good enough. Am I right? [Person2]:  Yeah, I guess so. Maybe I can go to sleep now and get up early to review the lessons tomorrow. [Person1]:  An excellent idea. Work now and play later. [Person2]:  I know you're right. School is more important than TV. Can I watch one more show, then go to bed. [Person1]:  No, now it's bedtime.
[Person1]:  Why are you so quiet? [Person2]:  My girlfriend just broke up with me. [Person1]:  You must feel terrible now. [Person2]:  Yeah. [Person1]:  I remember my first break up. It was the worst feeling in the world. I was crying everyday for three months. And slowly, it got better. I know you'll feel better too. [Person2]:  You've been through this too? [Person1]:  Yeah. I remember it very clearly. The pain makes it easy to remember. I know you're really hurting right now, but you know many people experience break ups. [Person2]:  But it hurts too much. [Person1]:  I know it's painful, but it's only temporary. After the pain goes away, you'll find other girls. [Person2]:  What if I don't want to find another girl? [Person1]:  You'll change your mind. Look at everyone in the world. They all break up and move on. The faster you understand this, the quicker you will recover. [Person2]:  You're right. [Person1]:  I also know you must still have strong feelings for her, but try to think of all the bad things. You know she didn't treat you that well. Is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with? [Person2]:  Yeah. Thanks for the talk. [Person1]:  I'll give you a call later. We should hang out. It's good to be around people. [Person2]:  Ok. I'll talk to you later.
[Person1]:  Alright, tell me what you think. [Person2]:  Don't you think it's a bit bright? [Person1]:  Yeah, maybe you're right. How about this outfit? [Person2]:  This dress looks lovely on you, but it's not very practical, is it? [Person1]:  No, I don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon, but I love the way it looks. I just had to try it on! What do you think about this? It's casual, yet sophisticated. [Person2]:  I like the jeans, but you need something to go with the top. It's too plain on its own. [Person1]:  How about this scarf, these earrings, AMD an anklet? [Person2]:  That might be going overboard a bit. How about just that scarf with a bracelet? [Person1]:  That's a good idea. You have a lot of good fashion sense. [Person2]:  Thanks. You'd be ok on your own. There are loads of fashion victims out there, and you are not one of them. Have you tried it on yet? [Person1]:  Yep. Here it is. What do you think? [Person2]:  That looks great. Just one more thing---you need some high heels with those jeans. Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them? [Person1]:  The leopard print sounds fabulous. Are they a name brand? [Person2]:  No, they're a Prada knock-off for 1/10 of the price of the real thing. [Person1]:  That's even better than the real thing. [Person2]:  If I were you, I'd buy that now while it's on sale. If you spend $ 100, you get a $ 50 voucher for more clothes. [Person1]:  It's too bad I did all that shopping yesterday!
[Person1]:  What's wrong, Dave? You look down today. [Person2]:  I didn't pass the English exam. How to learn English well? Can you give me some suggestions? [Person1]:  Well, English is a ' paper tiger '. Its natural enemy is adequate practice. [Person2]:  I have done a lot of reading comprehension exercises, and I also spend much time in memorizing English words. [Person1]:  I suggest you read English texts aloud every day, and try to speak more. That will be beneficial to cultivate your sense of the language. [Person2]:  Really? I'll have a try. Maybe I will get high marks next time.
[Person1]:  Do you know Yahoo Greetings, Edgar? [Person2]:  Sure. It's a popular e-card website. [Person1]:  Can you tell me how to send one on it? [Person2]:  Okay. Did you get the Yahoo ID? [Person1]:  ID? What's that? [Person2]:  I mean, you must register first before you send a card. [Person1]:  Oh. I see. But I have done it. [Person2]:  Ok. Choose the card which you like best, and fill in the following blanks with both your and your friend's names and e-mail addresses. [Person1]:  Is that all? [Person2]:  Don't forget to send. [Person1]:  Oh. I see. Thanks.
[Person1]:  Hello, I'm returning your phone call. [Person2]:  I'm glad that you could get back to me so fast. [Person1]:  No problem, but what were you calling about? [Person2]:  I needed to talk to you about your son. [Person1]:  Is he messing up in school? [Person2]:  He was acting up in class one day last week. [Person1]:  What was he doing?

I've always been interested in that. How much is the entrance fee? [Person1]:  I'm not sure, but as far as I know, most factory tours are free. They are sponsored by the company providing the tour. [Person2]:  really? What do the companies do that for? [Person1]:  I believe most of them think of it as good public relations. They can promote their product and make their company better-known.

[Person1]:  If only you hadn't spent so much money on your vacation! [Person2]:  You're right. But I really had a happy vacation. [Person1]:  OK, Maybe you can move into Kelly's house and share that with her for a couple of months. [Person2]:  Thank you. But I don't want to bother you too much. [Person1]:  No trouble at all. [Person2]:  How much should I pay for the rent? [Person1]:  About 400 yuan a month. [Person2]:  Great. That's one-third less than it was when I first rented a house.

[Person1]:  Is beach volleyball different from the volleyball you play in the centres? [Person2]:  Yes, it's a very different game. Instead of six players on a team, it's only two players. [Person1]:  You mentioned you played in tournaments--now do you do quite well in the tournaments? [Person2]:  Yes, I've played for South West England and we've got through to the semi-finals of different England tournaments, and for Wessex, my other volleyball team, we've actually won a few tournaments. So yes, I have done quite well. [Person1]:  Oh well done!
[Person1]:  I'm not a Christian. I just want to know why Americans believe that sort of thing.  [Person2]:  Believe what?  [Person1]:  You know... like, say God is the creator of the universe, the Bible, and Jesus Christ. . .  [Person2]:  You don't believe that? Everyone interprets the Bible in a different way. To some people, the Gospel5 is a source of much comfort.  [Person1]:  What do you believe, John? Are you Christian?  [Person2]:  To tell you the truth, I don't know if I'm a Christian or not. Christians don't often share the same belief. But I believe that we all possess, by the grace of God, the potential to create fantastic changes on this earth.  [Person1]:  Do you believe that one religion is better than another?  [Person2]:  No, all religions are essentially based on the same ideals, so no one is really better.  [Person1]:  Do you go to church regularly?  [Person2]:  When I'm home in the States, I go, but not in China. 
[Person1]:  I'd like to check out, here's my key card. [Person2]:  Thank you, Mister Johnson and here's your bill. [Person1]:  Many thanks. Wow! I sure spent a lot of money in this hotel. [Person2]:  I hope your stay was pleasant. [Person1]:  Uh yeah, this could be a great hotel if you got rid of all the insects and you should improve the food you serve. [Person2]:  I'm so sorry. Well, to make you feel better we'll offer you a free stay in any of our hotels. [Person1]:  Thanks. [Person2]:  I'm glad these small problems didn't ruin your visit. [Person1]:  Yeah, the city itself was great, I like coming here a lot. [Person2]:  Good to hear you had some wonderful experiences. [Person1]:  I did and I met so many helpful people. [Person2]:  Have a pleasant trip home.
[Person1]:  Tom, today is already July fifth. You are leaving for London in 5 days. Have you booked a flight ticket? [Person2]:  Yes, I did that this morning. [Person1]:  Will you go to the airport by bus or by taxi? [Person2]:  Jim will go to the airport that morning to give me a lift.
[Person1]:  This is my house. Let me show you around it. [Person2]:  How beautiful the detached house is! [Person1]:  Follow me to the back-yard. [Person2]:  It's marvelous! The lawn looks like a green carpet, and the garden with so many lovely flowers. [Person1]:  We had the grass cut and the flowers trimmed this morning. [Person2]:  No wonder it smells fragrant. [Person1]:  Here is the swimming pool and we can swim later. [Person2]:  It's fantastic!
[Person1]:  Excuse me, do you know where the visa office is? [Person2]:  Yes, I do. I'll walk you there. [Person1]:  Thanks. [Person2]:  Are you applying to study or work abroad? [Person1]:  I want to study abroad. [Person2]:  What do you want to study? [Person1]:  I hope to study English Literature. [Person2]:  Have you got your visa yet? [Person1]:  Not yet. I have an interview with a visa official today. [Person2]:  I see. Is it your first interview? [Person1]:  No, I'Ve already been here for 3 interviews.
[Person1]:  Let's play a game! [Person2]:  OK! How about Scrabble? [Person1]:  No, no, a friend of mine taught me this really fun game. I'm going to describe someone's face, and you guess who it is! [Person2]:  OK! [Person1]:  Let's see. He has a roman nose, bushy eyebrows and dimples! [Person2]:  Our cousin Pete! My turn! She has a pointy nose, sunken eyes and a mole on her chin! [Person1]:  Aunt Rose! That mole is so huge! OK, my turn. He has a crooked nose and full lips. He has quite a few freckles and an oval face. Oh, he is also bald! [Person2]:  Your future husband! [Person1]:  Not funny.
[Person1]:  It's very nice to meet you. [Person2]:  Nice meeting you, too. [Person1]:  I can't believe I'm actually speaking to a candidate. [Person2]:  You can ask me questions, if you'd like. [Person1]:  I want to ask you what your policy is on gay marriage. [Person2]:  Everyone should be able to love who they want. [Person1]:  Would you make gay marriage legal? [Person2]:  I sure would. [Person1]:  I know a lot of people wouldn't agree with that. [Person2]:  That's not my problem. [Person1]:  I think that is really cool of you. [Person2]:  I'm glad to hear that.
[Person1]:  Did you listen to the weather report this morning? [Person2]:  Yes, I did. It will be cloudy in the afternoon. I hope that it won't rain. [Person1]:  Have you made the sandwiches yet? [Person2]:  No, I haven't. I'll start right away. Did you get the soft drinks? [Person1]:  Yes, I did. They are in the refrigerator. [Person2]:  Would you put plastic knives and forks in the picnic basket? And don't forget the paper plates and napkins. [Person1]:  Oh, Nancy called a while ago. She told me that she would like to bring something for the picnic. [Person2]:  I'll call her right away and ask her to bring a bottle of wine.
[Person1]:  Jack, sit down and listen. This is important. We'll have to tackle the problems of the exporting step by step. And the first move is to get an up-to-date picture of where we stand now. [Person2]:  Why don't we just concentrate on expanding here at home? [Person1]:  Of course, we should hold on to our position here. But you must admit the market here is limited. [Person2]:  Yes, but it's safe. The government keeps out foreigners with import controls. So I must admit I feel sure we could hold our own against foreign bikes, [Person1]:  I agree. That's why I am suggesting exporting. Because I feel we canpete with the best of them. [Person2]:  What you are really saying is that we'd make more profit by selling bikes abroad, where we have,a cost advantage and can charge high prices. [Person1]:  Exactly. [Person2]:  But, wait a minute. Packaging, shipping, finaetc. will push up our cost and we could end up no better off, maybe worse off. [Person1]:  OK. Now there are extra costs involved. But if we do it right, they can be built into the price of the bike and we can still be competitive. [Person2]:  How sure are you about our chances of success in the foreign market? [Person1]:  Well, that's the sticky one. It's going to need a lot of research. I'm hoping to get your help. Well, come on, Jack. Is it worth it, or not? [Person2]:  There will be a lot of problems. [Person1]:  Nothing we can't handle. [Person2]:  Um... I'm not that hopeful. But, yes, I think we should go ahead with the feasibility study. [Person1]:  Marvelous, Jack. I was hoping you be on my side.
[Person1]:  Come in. Please have a seat. [Person2]:  Thank you. [Person1]:  I'm Paul Turner. Branch Manager. [Person2]:  Katie Thomas, nice to meet you. [Person1]:  I hear that you're looking for temporary office work. [Person2]:  That's right. [Person1]:  How old are you, Katie? [Person2]:  Eighteen. [Person1]:  That's rather young. What experience have you had? [Person2]:  Well, I've just left school, in fact, and I'm looking for a job between now and when I go to college. [Person1]:  It doesn't sound as if we can help, Katie. You see, our clients are very demanding, especially when it comes to new office technology. [Person2]:  Oh, that's no problem. I took extra classes in office skills at school. [Person1]:  Oh, perhaps you'd like to outline what you've been doing? [Person2]:  I started by learning keyboard skills. Then I went in to learn about word processing. [Person1]:  Good. You seem qualified from the technical point of view. But how well do you think you'll get along with people in an office? [Person2]:  I think I'm quite adaptable. I belonged to the drama society, as well as working on the school magazine. And I played a bit of sports. So I'm used to working as part of a team. [Person1]:  Sounds good. Let's see... There's a request from Johnson's Imports for 'a bright youngster...' .
[Person1]:  Do you wear a seatbelt every time you drive or ride in a car? [Person2]:  Do I have to? I'm a great driver with fifteen years of driving experience. [Person1]:  The chances of being injured in a car accident this year are one in seventy-five. I think that's worth thinking about seriously. [Person2]:  I've never had a serious accident. [Person1]:  My brother was not as lucky as you. Last December, he was almost killed in an accident. He wasn't wearing a seatbelt. [Person2]:  Wow, that's terrible. [Person1]:  Fastening your seatbelt should be an automatic thing as soon as you get into your car. But too many people still refuse to wear seatbelts. [Person2]:  OK, I get the message. From now on, I'll wear my seatbelt.
[Person1]:  Honey, how long have we been living here? [Person2]:  About 10 years. What's wrong? [Person1]:  I am thinking about redecorating our house. [Person2]:  That would cost a lot of money. But we do need to do some changes to the house. [Person1]:  Right. What about repainting the living room in yellow? [Person2]:  Good idea. I like the countryside style. [Person1]:  Great minds think the same. And we can also ask someone to draw a picture on the wall. [Person2]:  It sounds great. And the curtain should be changed too. [Person1]:  OK. Maybe we should make a blue program first.
[Person1]:  Mandy, could you make a call to the cinema to see if there are still some seats left for the movie this afternoon? [Person2]:  I have already booked the tickets online for the 2 [Person1]:  Ok, well, the Smiths want to move our appointment forward by half hour earlier, that means we should be there at 11 [Person2]:  Then we don't have enough time, we'd better get moving. Oh, before I forget, can you remind me to stop by the bookstore on the way back home? I have to order a book there. [Person1]:  Ok.
[Person1]:  Excuse me. We're leaving today. I'd like to pay our bills now. [Person2]:  OK. By the way, I'd like to tell you that the check-out time is 12 [Person1]:  I see. [Person2]:  Have you used any hotel services this morning or had breakfast at the hotel dining room, Mr. Green? [Person1]:  Yes, my friend and I just had breakfast at the dining room, but we didn't use any services. [Person2]:  How about the charge for the days you shared the room with your friend? [Person1]:  Please add to my account. [Person2]:  The total for the eight days is five hundred sixty yuan. [Person1]:  OK. Here you are.
[Person1]:  What are you doing, Mum? [Person2]:  I'm planting cabbage. [Person1]:  What's that in your hand? [Person2]:  Cabbage seed. You see, I put some soil in the box, sow the seed carefully like this, and then cover it with more soil. I'll keep the box in the shade so that the sun doesn't burn the little plants. [Person1]:  Is that all? [Person2]:  No. Later, in a few weeks' time I'll put the little plants in the earth. Then I'll water them to stop the soil from getting too dry. Several weeks after that, I will plant them in rows in the field. [Person1]:  Do you have to feed plants like you feed chickens? Or do they grow up by themselves? [Person2]:  In fact they grow better if you feed them. When the plants are in the ground I'll put some powder on the soil. The powder is made from fish, blood and bones. It'll make the cabbage plants grow big and strong. [Person1]:  Like me!
[Person1]:  What's that, a new video game? [Person2]:  Nope! It's the latest generation of PAD! You won't believe what it can do. [Person1]:  For instance? [Person2]:  It has a built-in camera unit that takes digital color stills. It also plays MP3 files, which I can save on media cards and then transfer to the hard drive of my computer. [Person1]:  Wow! Anything else? [Person2]:  This one comes with its own folding keyboard. It has a pre-installed handwriting recognition program. I can use the stylus to write on the screen. [Person1]:  What if I want to use CD-ROMs or floppies? [Person2]:  Just plug in a peripheral CD or floppy drive and you're ready to go!
[Person1]:  Hello! So you are leaving today. [Person2]:  Hello. Thank you for seeing me off. You actually don't need to bother. [Person1]:  It is my pleasure to see you off. [Person2]:  Thanks a lot. I hope to see you again. [Person1]:  I hope so, too. [Person2]:  Thanks again for everything you have done for me. [Person1]:  You're welcome. Have a nice trip!
[Person1]:  So how much should I gamble? [Person2]:  Why not fifty or one-hundred dollars? [Person1]:  Okay. One-hundred then. Do you think I will lose it? [Person2]:  I don't know. You have to be smart, but you have to be lucky too. Some games are all luck. With some, you need to be smart. [Person1]:  I want games that are all luck. [Person2]:  I knew you would say that! Then you should play the slot machines. [Person1]:  Slot machines? No, I don't want that! That's too boring. I want a game with cards or dice. [Person2]:  So what do you want to play then? [Person1]:  Blackjack. We can play blackjack. And I will gamble one-hundred, or maybe two-hundred dollars. [Person2]:  Huh? You are breaking our rule already! And we didn't even start to play yet! [Person1]:  Oh, don't be so strict! We are in Las Vegas. [Person2]:  Yes, and if I stay with you, we will have to walk back home to New York. Because we will lose all our money and our plane tickets too!
[Person1]:  I want to buy some meat.  [Person2]:  What kind would you like?  [Person1]:  I want one pound of ground beef.  [Person2]:  That's going to be about $2. 48.  [Person1]:  That will be fine.  [Person2]:  What else can I get for you?  [Person1]:  Let me also have three pounds of chicken breasts.  [Person2]:  That's going to be $4. 05 a pound.  [Person1]:  Can you tell me the total cost of the chicken breasts?  [Person2]:  That will be $12. 15.  [Person1]:  That's all I'm going to get today.  [Person2]:  That's fine. Let me get your meat. 
[Person1]:  Where can I enjoy the best local food? [Person2]:  Well! You like sea food? [Person1]:  Yes, I do. [Person2]:  Then I'd like to suggest you try Anchor Inn on Seaside Drive. [Person1]:  Is it very far from here? [Person2]:  No, you can walk from here.
[Person1]:  I've read your resume and know a lot of things about your qualifications for this position. One thing you didn't mention is why you left your last job? I know the company you worked for is a good company. [Person2]:  yes, it's a good company. But the management changed last month. We didn't get along, so I quit. [Person1]:  I understand. Why would you like to join our company? [Person2]:  I'm qualified for this position. And I've heard a lot of good things about your company. [Person1]:  Like what? [Person2]:  You take care of your employees. And your company offers good salaries and benefits. [Person1]:  that's good to know. Why do you think you're qualified for this position? [Person2]:  I've got over seven years'experience working in this kind of position. I know I can do a good job in this position.
[Person1]:  Morning, Bob. Fancy meeting you here!  [Person2]:  Morning, Jenny. Haven't seen you for ages!  [Person1]:  Well, I thought I'd come to see you, so here I am.  [Person2]:  You did give me a surprise. How have you been?  [Person1]:  Fine, just fine. And you?  [Person2]:  Not so well. I've come down with the flu.  [Person1]:  I'm sorry to hear that. Take care of yourself.  [Person2]:  It's really great to see you again. How about a drink tonight?  [Person1]:  Sounds wonderful. When shall we make it?  [Person2]:  How about seven?  [Person1]:  OK.  [Person2]:  I'll pick you up.  [Person1]:  Thank you. 
[Person1]:  Where do you come from? [Person2]:  I come from Greece. [Person1]:  What's the climate like in your country? [Person2]:  It's very pleasant. [Person1]:  What's the weather like in spring? [Person2]:  It's often windy in March. It's always warm in April and May, but it rains sometimes. [Person1]:  What's it like in summer? [Person2]:  It's always hot in June, July and August. The sun shines every day. [Person1]:  Is it cold or warm in autumn? [Person2]:  It's always warm in September and October. It's often cold in November and it rains sometimes. [Person1]:  Is it very cold in winter? [Person2]:  It's often cold in December, January and February. It snows sometimes.
[Person1]:  I hate to do this to you, Alice, but I ' m going to have to ask you to put in some more overtime. [Person2]:  Does it have to be this afternoon, Mr. Fairbanks? I ' Ve already made plans. [Person1]:  Well, I would have preferred to do it today, but if you ' Ve already made plans, we can do it tomorrow. [Person2]:  I ' d appreciate that, sir. How long do you think you ' ll need me to stay?
[Person1]:  Are you ready to go to the mall? [Person2]:  Yeah. Dig my new pants? [Person1]:  Copycat! [Person2]:  What do you mean? [Person1]:  You went out and bought khakis, too! [Person2]:  No. Mine are a soft brown. Yours are khaki. [Person1]:  Whatever.
[Person1]:  Then, I'll see you next week, Ms. O'Brian? [Person2]:  Yes. Let's say Tuesday at noon. Bring your portfolio with you. [Person1]:  Certainly. Is there anything else you would like me to bring, Mr. O'Brian? [Person2]:  No, that's all. I already have your resume.
[Person1]:  Hello, fire service. [Person2]:  Oh, I'm ringing because I think there's a fire in the house opposite. Smoke is coming out of the upstairs windows. [Person1]:  Can you give me your name and address and telephone number, please? [Person2]:  Yes, Hank Cousins, 17 Mallett Street, Alford. [Person1]:  I'm sorry. Can you spell Mallett, please? [Person2]:  Yes. M-A-double L-E-double T. The telephone number is 6943168. The fire's in number 18 just across the road. [Person1]:  Is anyone in the house? [Person2]:  No they've gone on holiday. They went to the Mediterranean last Saturday, for two weeks. [Person1]:  All right, we'll get there immediately. [Person2]:  What shall I do? Shall I warn the neighbours? [Person1]:  Yes, you'd better tell the people living next door, at number 16 and number 20. But don't go into the house.
[Person1]:  Hello, this is Tom Davis. I have an appointment with Dr. Jones at eight o'clock this morning, but I'm afraid I'll be half an hour late. [Person2]:  That's all right. Dr. Jones doesn't have another appointment until nine o'clock.
[Person1]:  How time flies! The winter holidays are coming next week. [Person2]:  Yes, do you have any plans? [Person1]:  Certainly. I want to go to Egypt. What about you? [Person2]:  I'm afraid I can go nowhere. I failed my English exam. You know my parents are so strict with me. [Person1]:  Bad luck! [Person2]:  I see. Is Egypt an African country? Is it far? [Person1]:  Yes, it's in Africa and quite far. But it's not only the Pyramids that I want to see but the Aswan Dam. [Person2]:  You want to see? [Person1]:  Of course. I'll go there by boat on the Nile. [Person2]:  That'll be wonderful and interesting. How will you get there? [Person1]:  By air - by flight No. CA808. My sister works on it. And then I'll be treated as a king! [Person2]:  Don't be so proud. I'll be off now. I wish you a good trip. [Person1]:  Oh, sorry. I didn't mean that. I don't want to hurt you...
[Person1]:  I heard you got a new roommate. What's he like? [Person2]:  Yeah, Bob moved in last week. He is a nice guy and so far everything is cool except his girlfriend. [Person1]:  Oh? What's wrong with his girlfriend? [Person2]:  She came to see him last weekend. She is a nice girl but there's something wrong with her voice. I tried to smile and be polite, but the whole time all I could think was 'what's wrong with her voice'. [Person1]:  Well, I guess it might take some time to get used to. [Person2]:  I doubt it. Listening to her talk is terrible. [Person1]:  Oh, come on, it's not that bad. [Person2]:  No, it's so much bad. And they invited me out to dinner tonight. I really have no idea how I'm going to pull it off.
[Person1]:  how's it going?  [Person2]:  I'm in a really good mood, actually. How about you?  [Person1]:  to be honest, I'm a bit fed up.  [Person2]:  what's wrong?  [Person1]:  well, my boyfriend was supposed to call me last night, but he never did.  [Person2]:  that's too bad. I'm sure there's a logical explaination for it. Don't be too upset about it.  [Person1]:  the thing is, this isn't the first time he's promised to do something and then didn't.  [Person2]:  I see how that can get a bit annoying.  [Person1]:  a bit? I'm extremely annoyed that he didn't phone me when he promised me that he would! He's such a liar.  [Person2]:  so what are you going to do about it?  [Person1]:  I don't know. I've got mixed feelings about it. On the one hand, I really want to end it with him, but on the other hand, I don't want to be without him.  [Person2]:  what do you think would make you happier?  [Person1]:  in the long run, I think breaking up with him would make me much happier, but I know that I'll be depressed about it for a few weeks first.  [Person2]:  relationships can be confusing sometimes.  [Person1]:  what would you do if you were me?  [Person2]:  I'd call him and dump him now! You deserve better than him! 
[Person1]:  May I take your order?  [Person2]:  I'd like to see the menu, please.  [Person1]:  Oh, I'm so sorry. I thought you had one. Here you are.  [Person2]:  Don't you have any Chinese food?  [Person1]:  I'm afraid we don't. But I'm sure you'll enjoy our lunch special. 
[Person1]:  For the 100th anniversary of the opening of the library we are going to have a party.  [Person2]:  That's a wonderful way to celebrate this grand old library!  [Person1]:  I hoped you would be willing to brainstorm with me for party ideas.  [Person2]:  That is right up my alley. You say party and I'm there.  [Person1]:  Perfect. It will be open to the public and we anticipate roughly about five to seven hundred people.  [Person2]:  Will it be an all day event?  [Person1]:  Yes. And we checked with the city and we have permission to use the park adjacent to the library.  [Person2]:  That was quick thinking. 
[Person1]:  I found out when Jim's birthday is. It's this Friday.  [Person2]:  Let's plan a surprise party for him!  [Person1]:  Can you spread the word and ask everyone to bring some kind of snack food?  [Person2]:  That's easy. Anything else?  [Person1]:  Will you call his wife and let her know so that if she is available, she can come too?  [Person2]:  Won't he be surprised!  [Person1]:  I don't know how old he is though.  [Person2]:  That's O. K. Maybe his wife will spill the beans! 
[Person1]:  Here are the leads from last week's exhibit as a trade show. There are about forty or so that are hot. You should contact them immediately, in the next twenty-four hours if you can. The rest are categorized according to potential and interest. You can see we've got our hot stack, our warm stack, our lukewarms, and our cold but not dead stack.  [Person2]:  Haha. . . please don't tell me you've got a dead stack. I hate making cold calls. . .  [Person1]:  Don't worry, most of the leads on mildly interested, if not strongly interested. We've just got to make sure the Hot ones are contacted right away. And even the contacts that for what ever reason aren't prepared to make an order now, they might be interested in the future. Please be conscanciouss about getting a hold of everyone of these leads. We've spent a big chunk of marketing budget to find these people. I don't want our investment to go down the drain.  [Person2]:  Don't worry, I've gotchya covered. 
[Person1]:  Waiter, a table for two please.  [Person2]:  Yes, this way please.  [Person1]:  Can we see the menu please?  [Person2]:  Here you are.  [Person1]:  What's good today?  [Person2]:  I recommend crisp beef and fried duck.  [Person1]:  We don't want that. Well, perhaps we'll begin with mushroom soup and follow with some seafood and chips.  [Person2]:  Do you want any dessert?  [Person1]:  No dessert, thanks, just coffee.  [Person3]:  Can I have the check please?  [Person2]:  OK.  [Person1]:  Let me pay for the bill today.  [Person3]:  No, no. I think we should split the bill.  [Person1]:  Ok, if you really want to.  [Person3]:  Yes, I prefer to go Dutch when I'm on dates. 
[Person1]:  I don't understand why you always look so happy, so energetic. It seems like you've got good news everyday.  [Person2]:  Really? Do I look happy all the time?  [Person1]:  All I know is you look quite differently from other teachers.  [Person2]:  Oh, do you know why? Actually, it's easy. Because I always exercise. My exercise, I think, is very hard. I often feel very good after conquering these difficulties. I feel alive!  [Person1]:  Oh, I know. I saw you doing pull-ups one time on the campus5 and some students trying to imitate you.  [Person2]:  Yeah, they are doing it for fun. Seldom would people like my exercise. It's difficult and boring.  [Person1]:  It's true. Many students do the exercise when they have to. We have P. E. once a week.  [Person2]:  But I think Chinese students need to exercise more. Besides exercise will help them learn new things better. Don 't students want to have a good memory?  [Person1]:  Of course. I didn't know that. I only know exercise makes bodies stronger. I should take some exercise then. Do you have any suggestions?  [Person2]:  Well, do what you like to do. It can be anything. Jogging, doing aerobics, going bicycling, and playing ping-pong. Absolutely anything. Doing three or more workouts a week is good for you. But remember to do some stretches first.  [Person1]:  Oh, I know. Thank you. 
[Person1]:  When will I get the decoration materials? [Person2]:  Usually, we make the delivery every Tuesday afternoon. [Person1]:  Well, I won't be at home then. I usually work in the afternoon, but you can put the materials in the downstairs bookstore. [Person2]:  No problem. And what is your address? [Person1]:  I live on the thirty-fourth Golden Street, Portland. [Person2]:  OK, I have got all the information. [Person1]:  And how much should I pay? [Person2]:  With shipping charges, your total fare will be $96. Do you want to pay in cash or? [Person1]:  I don't have enough cash now. Could I use Wechat Pay to give you the money? [Person2]:  Certainly.
[Person1]:  Rachel, I've looked all over for the copies we need to hand out during our presentation. I can't find them anywhere. [Person2]:  Oh, that's terrible. The presentation kicks off in only 20 minutes. Did you check everywhere? [Person1]:  Yeah, my desk, your desk. I even went back to the copy machine to see if I left them there. [Person2]:  There's no time to search for them now. Just call John right away and tell him to make new copies as quickly as possible.
[Person1]:  I'd like to apply for a credit card. Can you help me with my application? [Person2]:  I'd be glad to. [Person1]:  I'm afraid that I don't have a credit history. I just came to this country. [Person2]:  Do you have an account with this bank? [Person1]:  I'm afraid not. [Person2]:  In that case I highly recommend you apply for a savings and checking account also. That would help with your credit card application. [Person1]:  What is the interest rate on your card? [Person2]:  The annual charge rate is 9. 5 %. [Person1]:  That's very expensive! [Person2]:  Not really. The credit card is a revolving account. You only pay interest on what you owe. [Person1]:  How does the bank bill its customers for credit card charges? [Person2]:  You will receive a monthly statement with each expenditure itemized. [Person1]:  Does the card provide any other benefits? [Person2]:  You can also get a cash advance up to 1, 000 dollars on this card.
[Person1]:  Good morning, Mr. Zhang, this is Jimmy calling from Polaroid Company. [Person2]:  Hi, Jimmy, good morning. [Person1]:  I regret to tell you that the position of Sales Manager has gone to another person. [Person2]:  I see. [Person1]:  We really believe that you are a highly qualified person. But the other candidate has several years of related experiences. [Person2]:  Maybe that is true. But I am a fast learner and I am willing to work overtime, and I do not mind a lot of business travel. [Person1]:  We surely believe you. [Person2]:  Can't you give me another chance and reconsider your decision? [Person1]:  I am afraid we are sticking to our choice. [Person2]:  Possibly you are now. But in case you will change your mind, please let me know. [Person1]:  OK.
[Person1]:  Nice and warm again, isn't it? [Person2]:  Oh, it's lovely. Think of the nasty weather we had last week. [Person1]:  How are you these days? [Person2]:  Fine, thank you. And you? [Person1]:  Fine today, though a bit under the weather last week.
[Person1]:  Hey Roy. I've been thinking for a long time. [Person2]:  Oh yeah. About what, Cindy? [Person1]:  About the future. About what I want to be. [Person2]:  Em, I'm sure there are a lot of things that you can do, like doctor, professor, hostess. [Person1]:  Em, maybe. I'd like a job in which I can often travel. [Person2]:  Well, what about being an air hostess? You could travel a lot. [Person1]:  No, I've thought of that. Air hostess worked really hard. It's so tiring. In planes aren't safe nowadays. They make crash because of bad weather or even be used as weapons if they fall into the wrong hands. [Person2]:  How about being an interpreter? You are really good at languages. And you could travel to international meetings. [Person1]:  No, I don't think so. Interpreting didn't sound interesting to me. [Person2]:  Well, what are you interested in? [Person1]:  Well, maybe I'll become an international business woman. It's so challenging. [Person2]:  But you don't like thinking about money? [Person1]:  Well, I could change. [Person2]:  Em, I don't know. Cindy, I just don't see you as a business person.
[Person1]:  I haven't seen Bill lately. How is he? [Person2]:  He's still pretty sick. [Person1]:  That's too bad. What does he have? [Person2]:  We don't know, but he's going to the doctor tomorrow. [Person1]:  Let me know if there's anything I can do. [Person2]:  Thanks a lot. I'll tell him.
[Person1]:  The results of the poll show Bill Clinton's approval rating has gone up in his second term. Do you find that interesting? [Person2]:  Well, I think Clinton deserves high marks for doing his job generally, but he may get low marks for his honesty and personal image. [Person1]:  That is exactly what the poll shows. Although the stating of Clinton as a person has gone down in the last two years of his term, his approval rating is as high as 66 percent. [Person2]:  I don't find this surprising. The poll data sound quite right. He is a good president. [Person1]:  But the poll says only 15 percent say he will be remembered as an outstanding president.
[Person1]:  What? I don't get it. . . [Person2]:  Many of the slower dances are danced to the lyrics of tragedies. He meant that you turned it into a comedy. [Person1]:  Well, I'm glad I made everyone happy. [Person2]:  He meant it in a good way. You added a little spice to the performance. [Person1]:  I'm glad you guys all have such a good sense of humor. Ha-ha. . . [Person2]:  Of course! That's why I always say, Eat, drink and be Greek!
[Person1]:  How was your job at the state owned enterprise? [Person2]:  Oh, I no longer work there. I'm working with a multi-national corporation. [Person1]:  You changed jobs again? Why do you move so frequently? [Person2]:  I want to try different things before I find the one I really like. [Person1]:  Why don't you stick with one job for a bit longer? [Person2]:  I could handle everything pretty well in the old position, so I decided to move around and learn something new. [Person1]:  How's your current job going? [Person2]:  I'm pretty satisfied with it. I can broaden my experience, learn lots of new things, and have more development opportunities.
[Person1]:  What's wrong? [Person2]:  I have a headache. These past few days I've been living off painkillers. Man, I feel like my head is going to explode. [Person1]:  You should get acupuncture treatment. My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her. [Person2]:  The results are too slow. On top of that, just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me. [Person1]:  They don't just randomly stick you, they find your pressure points. The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment, restoring the body's ' chi '. [Person2]:  But I get scared the moment I see a needle. How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end? [Person1]:  The needles are very thin, and as long as the doctor's technique is good, and the patient himself is relaxed, it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain. Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all. However, if you are really scared of acupuncture, scraping or cupping are also options. [Person2]:  Scraping is too terrifying. When they finish scrapping, your body is all red, as if you were just tortured. Cupping is the same, your body ends up with red circles all over. It looks like someone beat you up. [Person1]:  This only signifies that the toxins have left the body. Actually, there is only discomfort during the treatment process. Once it's over you feel very comfortable. [Person2]:  Chinese medicine is strange. The patients are already ill, and then the doctor makes them suffer more. [Person1]:  This is the only way to get at the problem. Anyway, if you want to relieve the pain, you are just going to have to be tough and do it. [Person2]:  Forget it. I don't want to inflict any more pain on myself. In a little while I'll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap.
[Person1]:  How long have you played the piano? You're great. [Person2]:  Thanks, I've been playing since I was 9 and now I'm 17. I have to practice for 2 hours every day, but I love it. [Person1]:  That's good. Since you do it so much, I wouldn't be able to sit still that long. Why do you like it? [Person2]:  Well, now that I have more experience I write my own music. I feel creative and I enjoy making people happy as they listen to me. [Person1]:  That's cool. I feel that way when I play soccer. When I play I feel good about using my skills and people like to watch me, you know what I mean? [Person2]:  Exactly.
[Person1]:  Don't throw paper on the floor, Bill. [Person2]:  Where shall I put it, miss? [Person1]:  Put it in the waste-paper basket, please. [Person2]:  But Peter and Tony put all their paper in the basket a few moments ago. Now it's full. [Person1]:  In that case, take the basket outside and empty it. [Person2]:  Yes, miss. [Person1]:  Where did you empty the basket, Bill? [Person2]:  In the playground, miss. [Person1]:  Silly boy! The dustbin is at the back of the school. Now pick up the paperand put it in the dustbiri.
[Person1]:  We have the capital ready. Right now I am looking at three different companies to produce our products. And your company, Mr. Chen, seems to me to be the best for what we want. [Person2]:  I appreciate your remarks. And we are always happy to do more business. But, you know, if we take on a contract to produce new products, we want to be confident the product is marketable. Because, to start producing new things requires a lot of preparation. It requires a lot of investment for us. [Person1]:  You have some doubts about our products, I understand. [Person2]:  I would like to offer you a good price. But I won't be able to do that if I think this is a one-shot deal. So I would like to have some confidence in your idea. [Person1]:  Of course. Let me tell you in some detail about our idea. You know the popular Hello Kitty products. [Person2]:  Yes, of course. [Person1]:  Well, the products in themselves are very simple. It is the logo that is successful. So, Hello Kitty is successful because of the logo, but the products are very simple. [Person2]:  And I would say the logo is successful mainly because it comes from Japan. It is the Japanese that have made it a fad. [Person1]:  That might be true. But we have a logo concept that is great. It is really great. I think it will catch on in Taiwan at least. Young people will love it. It is because of our logo that our products will sell. We just need someone to produce the products for us. We have the backup and people to do the marketing. [Person2]:  So what you are really trying to sell is a fad. [Person1]:  Yes, we would like to make things like key chains, plastic pencil sharpeners, plastic rulers, watches, wallets, things like that. Little accessories for young people. But the reason these will sell is the logo. Just like Hello Kitty. [Person2]:  I understand. But why won't you show me the logo? [Person1]:  Because it hasn't been copyrighted. We want to get some protection for it. But while we wait for copyright, we are investigating companies to produce the products. [Person2]:  I see. The problem, however, is that I can't be confident in giving you a good priceless I am confident your product will last. [Person1]:  I understand. For now, though, you could just give us an estimated price. We aren't going to sign a contract yet. We are just investigating. I only need to know that your company is capable of producing the products. And then, I only need a very rough idea of how much it might cost. [Person2]:  Alright. I understand. Right now you just want estimates. [Person1]:  Yes.
[Person1]:  Do you think I should join the basketball team, Mary? [Person2]:  Why not? If I were you, I certainly would. [Person1]:  But I'm afraid it'll take up too much of my time. [Person2]:  As the saying goes, work while you work, play while play. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, you know? [Person1]:  Hmm, you're right.
[Person1]:  Good morning, Mister Thompson. My name is Mary Brown. [Person2]:  Good morning, Miss Brown, take a seat please. [Person1]:  Thank you. [Person2]:  Well Miss Brown, could you please tell me about yourself? [Person1]:  Yes, of course. I'm 18 years old and just graduated from Peterson Secretary school. I read your ad. in the newspaper and I know that you're looking for a secretary. [Person2]:  Could you please tell me what you can do? [Person1]:  I can do whatever a secretary is expected to do, such as typing receiving phone calls, sending faxes or writing reports. [Person2]:  Well, it seems that your qualifications for the job are excellent. Could you tell me what kind of salary you're expecting? [Person1]:  I saw in the ad. that this position offers a salary of around $800 a month. [Person2]:  That's right. [Person1]:  That would be fine with me. [Person2]:  Is there anything you would like to know about the job? [Person1]:  No, not so far. [Person2]:  Good. Thank you for coming Miss Brown. I've enjoyed meeting and talking with you, we'll let you know the result as early as possible. [Person1]:  I appreciate the time you have given me.
[Person1]:  Mary's birthday is coming. What shall we buy for her? [Person2]:  Is a pen OK? [Person1]:  Er... She has lots of pens. What about getting her a bicycle? [Person2]:  Oh, no. We can't afford it. Let's get her a book. She loves reading very much. [Person1]:  That's a good idea.
[Person1]:  It's said that John's broken up.  [Person2]:  Really? But his wife has always waited on him hand and foot.  [Person1]:  I hear that John's leading a double wife.  [Person2]:  It's very bad of him to cheat on a lady like his wife. 
[Person1]:  Here we are this is my favorite place.  [Person2]:  How many times have you been here?  [Person1]:  I've never counted.  [Person2]:  I would like to sit near the window.  [Person1]:  Please be seated. It's my treat today.  [Person2]:  Thank you.  [Person1]:  It's so busy here.  [Person2]:  Fast food restaurants are popular now.  [Person1]:  What would you like to eat?  [Person2]:  I'd like to have a steak sandwich and a medium fry.  [Person1]:  Want something to drink?  [Person2]:  Coke please. Oh, no, a cup of hot chocolate will be fine. 
[Person1]:  Hello. Holiday Inn. May help you? [Person2]:  Yes, I'd like to book a room for 2 on the seventh of June. [Person1]:  OK. Let me check. Well, would you like a smoking or non-smoking room? [Person2]:  Well, how much is the non-smoking room? [Person1]:  $80, plus the 10% room tax. [Person2]:  OK, that'll be fine. [Person1]:  All right. We look forward to seeing you on June seventh. Oh, by the way, could I have your name, please?
[Person1]:  Hello, Cheetah Express Delivery Service. How may I help you? [Person2]:  Hello, I'm waiting for a package sent from your office in Chicago. The package number is XYZ9876. [Person1]:  I see. My computer says we sent it on December thirteenth and it was in Des Moines on the fourteenth. You should have received it in Saint Paul the day after that. [Person2]:  That was yesterday. Any idea what happened? [Person1]:  I can find out for you. In any event, it should be there within the next couple of days. Please accept our apologies, sir.
[Person1]:  When asked about their impressions of their university life, many students expressed disappointment. So professor Smith, could you explain how it happens? [Person2]:  Well, after their highly controlled high school lives, the students were having difficulty adjusting to the free time in the university. When asked to describe their high school lives, many of them say they got up at 6
[Person1]:  I ' Ve come to hear about your offer for bristles. [Person2]:  We have the offer ready for you. Let me see... here it is. 100 cases Houston Bristles, 57 mm, at 10 pounds sterling per kilogram, C. I. F European Main Ports, for shipment in June 2001. The offer is valid for five days. [Person1]:  Why, your price has soared. It ' s almost 25 % higher than last year ' s. It would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price. [Person2]:  I ' m a little surprised to hear you say that. You know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months. The price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere. [Person1]:  I ' m afraid I can ' t agree with you there. I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ' Ve received from other sources. [Person2]:  But you must take the quality into consideration. Everyone in the trade knows that US ' s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries. [Person1]:  I agree that yours are of better quality. But there ' s competition from synthetic products, too. You can ' t very well ignore that. Prices for synthetic bristles haven ' t changed much over the years. [Person2]:  There ' s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses. That ' s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones. To be frank with you, if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us, we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price. [Person1]:  Well, we ' ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price. But I ' ll have to try, I suppose.
[Person1]:  Good morning, can I help you? [Person2]:  I want to American breakfast with fried eggs sunny side up. [Person1]:  What kind of juice do you prefer, sir? [Person2]:  Breakfast juice and please make my coffee very strong. [Person1]:  Yes, sir. American breakfast with fried eggs sunny side up. Breakfast juice and black coffee. And my correct, sir? [Person2]:  Yes, that ' s right. [Person1]:  Is there anything else, sir? [Person2]:  No, that ' s all. [Person1]:  Good morning, sir. I ' Ve got breakfast your ordered. [Person2]:  Just put it on the table please. [Person1]:  Do you need anything else, sir? [Person2]:  No, thanks. Oh, yes, could I have some juice for the mini bar? [Person1]:  What kind of juice do you like sir? [Person2]:  Tomato or orange juice, please. [Person1]:  Yes, sir. I ' ll get them for you right away. Would you please sign this bill first? Thank you, sir.
[Person1]:  Are your ready to go to the supermarket? [Person2]:  Yes, are you? [Person1]:  I've got my money and my keys, so I'm ready. [Person2]:  You do know that it's absolutely freezing out, don't you? I'd put a coat on if I were you. [Person1]:  It wasn't cold out this morning. [Person2]:  Well, it's started raining since then. Look out the window! It's pouring rain out there! [Person1]:  Have a look outside for me. Does that look like hail to you? [Person2]:  It does, actually. Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping. [Person1]:  That's a good idea. But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it. [Person2]:  Ok. I'll go move the car if you turn the heat on. It's a bit chilly in here. [Person1]:  How long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last? [Person2]:  I don't know. The weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night. [Person1]:  Maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse. [Person2]:  I don't think we have anything to worry about. Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well? [Person1]:  Good idea. That will help us to warm up. [Person2]:  If I'm not back in ten minutes, come and find me. [Person1]:  Alright. I'll have a cup of tea waiting for you.
[Person1]:  Hello. I was wondering if Taylor Smith has checked out yet? [Person2]:  Just one moment. I'll check with the cancer ward desk. [Person1]:  The cancer ward!? Oh, my. It's worse than we thought. [Person2]:  Ma'am, I'm sorry. The cancer ward said Mr. Smith passed away two days ago. [Person1]:  That's impossible! I'm talking about Mister Taylor Smith. [Person2]:  Yes, ma'am. He died from complications of stomach cancer. I'm very sorry. [Person1]:  I'm really sick!
[Person1]:  Hey, May. How about getting together for a movie tonight? [Person2]:  Sure. What's playing? [Person1]:  Well, Let me check the newspaper. What about The Terminal? [Person2]:  Wow, it stars Catherine Zeta-Jones, my favorite actress. [Person1]:  Well, birds of a feather flock together. I like her too. She was in a lot of dramas. [Person2]:  She is so beautiful and elegant. And she is famous for her fine acting. [Person1]:  What's more, she doesn't have scandals. And she likes to take part in the charitable activities. [Person2]:  Who is the director? [Person1]:  Steven Spielberg. Another superstar. [Person2]:  Yes, a legend, also. I still remember, his movies, Jurassic Park and Schindler's List got him nine Oscar awards in 1994. [Person1]:  Can you introduce the story of The Terminal briefly? [Person2]:  It tells a romantic and humorous love story. [Person1]:  This is really exciting movie. Lets go to this one.
[Person1]:  What can I do for you, Ma'am? [Person2]:  I want to buy a cell phone for my daughter. [Person1]:  How old is she? [Person2]:  She is 17. It's for her birthday. [Person1]:  We have a new-fashioned cell phone especially designed for young girls. The brand name is Nokia. [Person2]:  Thanks, but I want to have a look at the Motorola's products. [Person1]:  Sure. This is the one I will not hesitate to recommend. Its color and style is so attractive and also the quality is really reliable. [Person2]:  Sounds perfect. I'll take the pink one. Can you pack it for me? [Person1]:  Sure. By the way, here are some free adornments. Would you like one? [Person2]:  Why not? The Sweetheart pendant matches the cell phone well. I'd take this one. [Person1]:  Have a seat over there. I'll pack it up for you right away. [Person2]:  Thanks.
[Person1]:  Hello, there. How can I help? [Person2]:  Hello. I'm hoping to buy some Treasury Certificates today. Are they available? [Person1]:  Certainly, Visible Treasury Certificates. Then you can get a receipt from the savings office as proof of payment. Hence the'visible', you can see it. [Person2]:  Ah, right. How much do I need to spend? [Person1]:  The minimum is 100 RIB, and the maximum is 500, 000 RIB. [Person2]:  How about Bearer Certificates? Are they different? [Person1]:  Yes, they are different because they are printed by the Ministry of Finance in set amounts. Just 100 RIB, 500 RMB and 1, 000 RIB, you cannot choose from many amounts, you see.
[Person1]:  Mom, Happy mother's Day! Here's my card. [Person2]:  What a surprise! Thanks. It's beautiful. [Person1]:  Thank you for your love and care over the years, I appreciate it, mom. [Person2]:  This is the best card I ever received. [Person1]:  Mom, what can I do for you today? [Person2]:  Nothing, son. I'm already very happy. [Person1]:  How about dinner tonight? My treat. [Person2]:  Actually. I prefer we eat at home. We'll have more time to catch up that way. [Person1]:  I'm sorry I haven't dropped in that much these past few years. Business kept me too busy, I apologize. [Person2]:  Oh, don't mention it. I'm proud of you! [Person1]:  Thank you, mom. I love you so much!
[Person1]:  What's the problem, sir? [Person2]:  I bought this toy gun from your store two weeks ago. My son played with it only twice and it broke. [Person1]:  Do you keep the receipt? [Person2]:  Yes, and I have the warranty, too. [Person1]:  What do you want me to do about it? [Person2]:  I'd like you to replace this one without charge if you can.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, sir. May I help you? [Person2]:  Yes. I have to change a room. [Person1]:  What's wrong? [Person2]:  Next door is so noisy. I can't sleep at all. [Person1]:  OK, I am sorry for that. We will arrange another one for you.
[Person1]:  What can I do for you, sir? [Person2]:  I'm looking for a jacket for my son. [Person1]:  Come with me, please. Here are jackets for boys. [Person2]:  The black one is nice. How much is it? [Person1]:  Twenty five pounds. [Person2]:  Oh, I'm afraid it's too expensive. [Person1]:  What about the blue one over there? It looks nice, too. And it's cheaper. [Person2]:  But it's a bit small. Have you a bigger size? [Person1]:  Sorry, we haven't. But we'll get some soon. Will you come next week? [Person2]:  All right. I'll come again.
[Person1]:  Hello, who is speaking? [Person2]:  Hello, this is John. I want to speak to Linda. [Person1]:  This is her. [Person2]:  Hi, Linda, I'm just calling to invite you to a dinner party tomorrow evening. [Person1]:  Really? What time and where? [Person2]:  7 [Person1]:  Yes, please, I'll need a ride. I'll be waiting for you then. [Person2]:  See you tomorrow at seven. Make sure your dress a little formally. I heard the restaurant is kind of upscale. [Person1]:  Thank you, see you then. [Person2]:  See you.
[Person1]:  Say, Lisa, what are you doing? [Person2]:  Watching a Japanese film. I'm going to spend all next year in Japan, and I think I should find out more about its culture. [Person1]:  You mean you have been accepted into the program? [Person2]:  I sure have. [Person1]:  That's wonderful. You must be excited. [Person2]:  Excited and nervous. You know I have to work on some basic conversation skills. [Person1]:  How much Japanese can you understand? [Person2]:  Only a little now. But I'm going to take a special language class next month. [Person1]:  I wish I were as clever as you are at foreign languages. I would love to study abroad. [Person2]:  Then why don't you? The school has a lot of programs that don't require the mastery of a foreign language. You just have to be the kind of person who is quick to learn new things and can get used to a new environment fast. [Person1]:  I thought all programs required one to know a foreign language. Thank you for letting me know this.
[Person1]:  Do you let people know when you are taking pictures of them. [Person2]:  I try not to. I don't like pictures of people who pose for the camera. I like people who are going about their daily business without being aware of the camera.
[Person1]:  what's up?  [Person2]:  not much. I'm just trying to hook up to the internet. I'm having a few problems though.  [Person1]:  what's wrong?  [Person2]:  I've got all the cords plugged in, but it appears that I'm offline.  [Person1]:  Are you using dial-up or broadband?  [Person2]:  actually, I've got a wireless connection.  [Person1]:  In that case, you need to turn on your airport.  [Person2]:  I hook up to the Internet every day. I can't believe I didn't do that.  [Person1]:  do you like ever chat online?  [Person2]:  No, but I'd like to. Do you have to pay to do instant messaging?  [Person1]:  Oh, no. You can regsiter for free. Just go to the yahoo website and it will tell you how to do it.  [Person2]:  what do you do if people want to talk to you online but you don't want to talk to them?  [Person1]:  well, you can always block them. When I don't feel like talking to certain people online, that's what I do.  [Person2]:  what's your email address? I'll add you to my contacts list.  [Person1]:  it's aubreyinchina@yahoo. com.  [Person2]:  cool. We can meet up in a chat room sometime or just chat online using messenger. thanks for your help.  [Person1]:  don't mention it. 
[Person1]:  Hello, Mary. [Person2]:  Hi, Peter. What a surprise. What are you doing here? [Person1]:  Oh, I was just passing by. Our shop is under repair this afternoon and I have a half day off. Would you like a ride in my car? [Person2]:  I'd love to, but I've got classes from 2 [Person1]:  No, thank you. Maybe next time. Do you always come on your bicycle? [Person2]:  No, not always. When it rains, I come by bus. [Person1]:  Do you have to work long hours here? [Person2]:  No, we don't. We start at 9 [Person1]:  Bye. See you later.
[Person1]:  What are you looking for? [Person2]:  I smell fresh baked bread. Did you just make some bread? [Person1]:  Yes, but don't touch it yet. It just came out of the oven and needs about 20 minutes to cool down. [Person2]:  I don't want it cool. I wanted hot from the oven. [Person1]:  No, don't touch it. It's really still baking inside when it comes out. It needs time to finish. The bread will be too soft and sticky inside if you break it open now. [Person2]:  But that's the way I like it. Hot and soft, hmm... I'll just take a small piece. [Person1]:  Fine. If you like it that way, go ahead. But it's much better after it rests for a while. [Person2]:  Don't worry. I'll eat it that way, too. Are we gonna have breakfast soon? What's cooking? [Person1]:  Your favorite [Person2]:  Who? [Person1]:  My sister Kay. [Person2]:  Hmm... There goes my appetite. Why is she coming over? [Person1]:  You shouldn't be so rude. She's a nice girl, just a little depressed sometimes. [Person2]:  A little? [Person1]:  Anyway, she should be happier today. She just got a promotion at her job. Kay will be the new manager at her store. She's bringing cookies to celebrate. [Person2]:  I love Donuts. I guess she can come if she's bringing cookies.
[Person1]:  It ' s so great to be here! I ' m so excited to help you and my daughter with your new home! [Person2]:  We ' re glad that you ' re here. Would you like a tour of the house? [Person1]:  That ' d be great, but could I have a cup of tea first? [Person2]:  Sure, I ' ll just go put the kettle on. Why don ' t you have a seat on the sofa and I ' ll go take care of things in the kitchen. [Person1]:  That would be lovely, thanks. [Person2]:  Do you take milk or sugar with your tea? [Person1]:  I ' ll take a little milk, but no sugar, please. Make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup. [Person2]:  Ok. What do you think about our living room? [Person1]:  Well, I do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table, but I don ' t really care for curtains. Did you get them at a yard sale? They look ancient. [Person2]:  My parents gave them to us as a house warming gift. [Person1]:  Oh dear. Well, I suppose they will do for now. do you ever dust in here? It seems a bit dusty in here. [Person2]:  Your daughter usually does the dusting, and I do the vacuuming. [Person1]:  I see. Well, I can help with the chores while I ' m here. You two could probably use my help. [Person2]:  That ' s very nice of you to offer. Here ' s your tea. Be careful, it ' s still quite hot.
[Person1]:  I'm sorry, ladies. Mr. Smith's viewing is over. It ended an hour ago. [Person2]:  But we just drove across town. Can't we just go in to see him one last... [Person1]:  I'm afraid not. But at tomorrow's funeral, the family requested an open casket service. [Person2]:  This is all too fast. He's my best friend, and now he's gone. [Person1]:  I'm sorry. I know it must have come as a great shock. [Person2]:  The viewing was for saying goodbye, and I didn't even get that.
[Person1]:  How did your interview go? [Person2]:  Pretty well. I don't know if I'll get the promotion or not, but I feel good about it. [Person1]:  If you get the promotion, what will your new title be? [Person2]:  If I get the promotion, I will be a senior engineer instead of an assistant engineer. [Person1]:  Will you get a pay-raise, too? [Person2]:  Whenever you are given added responsibilities, you should get a promotion. [Person1]:  That makes sense. Who interviewed you? [Person2]:  My boss. [Person1]:  What kinds of questions did she ask you? [Person2]:  She asked me about my ability to work in a team and what I thought a good boss should be. [Person1]:  The second one sounds rather difficult to answer. What did you tell her? [Person2]:  I told her that I'm an excellent team player and that a good boss should treat male and female employees equally. [Person1]:  Those are good answers. How did she react? [Person2]:  She told me that even when I become a senior engineer, I'll have to work with the assistant engineers as a team. [Person1]:  What do you think about her as a boss? [Person2]:  She's pretty easy to get along with. She listens to her employees and treats everyone equally. [Person1]:  You're lucky. Not everyone has such a great boss! [Person2]:  That's true. She's highly esteemed among everyone at my company. [Person1]:  When you find out you get the promotion or not, let me know. [Person2]:  I will do.
[Person1]:  Did you hear what happened in the Scott case? Some of the sensitive material were leaked to the press. Now every newspapers is all over it. [Person2]:  Oh. . . I bet the firm is fuming. Do they know who spilled the beans? [Person1]:  I'm sure they have their suspicions! there were only a few of the senior level layers who were privy to the case details. [Person2]:  What kind of repercussions will there be for the people who are held responsible? [Person1]:  I'm sure there'll be canned! And there also might be some legal consequences. [Person2]:  Why would the person who told have problems with the law? [Person1]:  Because whoever let the cat out of the bag was breaking client confidentiality. [Person2]:  I didn't think about that. That's pretty serious. Are there investigators working on finding out who it was? [Person1]:  I'm sure management is on top of it.
[Person1]:  Do you want some dessert? [Person2]:  No thanks. We just need our check. Have you seen the waitress? [Person1]:  Oh, here comes our waitress with our check. [Person2]:  The service here has been really great, don't you think? [Person1]:  Yes, the service was quite good. [Person2]:  So, let's look at the check. The total is $ 36. 00. [Person1]:  How much do you think we should leave for a tip? [Person2]:  Usually people leave 15 %, but this was exceptional service. I am thinking that maybe 20 % would be appropriate. [Person1]:  I agree that 20 % would be just about right. [Person2]:  OK, so that will bring her tip to $ 7. 20. Add it to the $ 36. 00 and the total is $ 43. 20. [Person1]:  Yes, what a nice dinner that was! [Person2]:  We'll have to make sure to come back here again real soon.
[Person1]:  We need to figure out how much money we are spending and what we are spending it on? [Person2]:  Why? [Person1]:  Well, I think we could be saving more. [Person2]:  Really? Well. Ok. Get the receipts out. [Person1]:  Let's see. We spent 700 dollars for our home loan payment, 400 on groceries, 75 on utilities, 250 on gasoline, 100 on books and 300 on entertainment last month. [Person2]:  That's 1, 825 dollars. [Person1]:  We put 500 into the savings account and 750 into our stock account. [Person2]:  3, 075. Our paychecks are 3300 combined. That means we don't have any receipts for 225. [Person1]:  Right.
[Person1]:  What kind of packing do you plan to use for this consignment of goods? [Person2]:  Cartons. Is that okay? [Person1]:  I'm concerned about the possible jolting, squeezing and collision that may take place when these cases are moved about. [Person2]:  Well, what I can tell you is this. We've got an excellent record on making deliveries to our customers. Besides, all our cartons are lined with shockproof cardboards and are wrapped up with polyethylene sheets. So they're not only shockproof but also dampproof. [Person1]:  In that case, I guess I can rest assured. [Person2]:  Well, I guess you can say that. The safety of packing is something we always pay a lot of attention to. Especially for those fragile commodities, we've got to be extra careful. Otherwise, if the things we don't want to see happened, we would be responsible and that'll cause you a lot of inconvenience, too. [Person1]:  You're right. But wouldn't it be safer to use wooden cases? [Person2]:  We sure can if you want us to, but the charge will be much higher. [Person1]:  It wouldn't be worth the trouble in that case, would it? Let's still use cartons. [Person2]:  Sure, no problem. As I said, cartons are good enough for goods like this. You don't have to worry about it.
[Person1]:  Stan, do you have a minute? [Person2]:  Oh, hi, Cathy. Sure. What's up? [Person1]:  Well, I've been meaning to talk to you about the situation in the office. [Person2]:  I'm not in there very often. It's so noisy that I can't work. [Person1]:  That's exactly what I'm getting at. We're supposed to be able to do our preparation and marking in that office, but have you noticed? Jack constantly has students coming in to get help with his course. A lot of people are going in and out. [Person2]:  Has anybody spoken to him about it? [Person1]:  No, not yet, but someone's going to have to. [Person2]:  We can't really ask him to stop having students come in for help. Can we? [Person1]:  No, of course not. But I'm not able to do my work and neither are you. I imagine it's the same for the others in the office. [Person2]:  Hmmm, could we ask for a kind of meeting room? When TAs have to talk with a student, they could go to the meeting room and not use the office. You know, there's a room down the hall, rather a small room that we could ask to use. It's only for storing supplies. [Person1]:  You mean that little storage room? Oh, that would be too small. [Person2]:  Are you sure? With the cabinets taken out, it might be bigger than it looks. [Person1]:  Come to think of it, you may be on to something. I'd like to have a look at that room. Can we go there now? [Person2]:  Sure, Let's go.
[Person1]:  Hello, Barneys Garage. [Person2]:  Hello. Mr. Higgins, please. [Person1]:  He just stepped out. Can I take a message? [Person2]:  Oh yes, this is Penny's Pet Boutique. Please remind him that his appointment for his dog's shampoo and cut is on Saturday morning at 11 am. [Person1]:  I'll make sure he receives the message. [Person2]:  That's fine. [Person1]:  Thanks for calling.
[Person1]:  Good morning, Mrs. Wong. How are you? I haven't seen you around the building for the last couple of weeks. Is everything alright? [Person2]:  Morning, Mr. Jones. No, I haven't been out much recently. I've been feeling a bit under the weather. [Person1]:  I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you don't mind me saying, but you don't look very well. Your face is very pale. Perhaps you need some fresh air to bring the color back to your cheeks. It's a lovely day outside today. [Person2]:  That's just what I thought. I'm going to go for a walk in the park and then pop into the supermarket. [Person1]:  You look as if you've lost weight as well. [Person2]:  I haven't been eating like I usually do. Usually, I love my food, but these last two weeks I just haven't felt cooking and I've eaten very little. Most unlike me. [Person1]:  Have you been to the doctor? What did she say? [Person2]:  I didn't bother going to the doctor. It's nothing serious. [Person1]:  You never know. If you've been feeling like this for two weeks, it's worth getting a check-up just to be sure.
[Person1]:  What is Mr. Peterson going to do with his old house on London Road? Rent it or sell it? [Person2]:  I heard he is thinking of turning it into a restaurant, which isn't a bad idea, because it's still a solid building.
[Person1]:  It's Julia's birthday tomorrow. [Person2]:  Are you sure? I think it should be the day after tomorrow. [Person1]:  Well, let me see. Oh, I'm sorry. You're fight. It is the day after tomorrow. Shall we buy her a gift? [Person2]:  Yes, of course. Shall we get her a new pen? [Person1]:  That sounds good. But I think it's better to buy her a box of chocolates. [Person2]:  Julia doesn't like sweet things. Didn't you know that? [Person1]:  You're right. Er... I know. We can give her a record, for she loves music very much. [Person2]:  That's great. Let's go to the music shop now.
[Person1]:  How do I apply to an American university?  [Person2]:  You should go to the library to find some information about American universities, and write to the Admission Office. Then the Admission Office will send you application forms and other related materials. From experience, many applicants write to several universities instead of just one.  [Person1]:  I was told that it took a lot of time and effort to apply.  [Person2]:  That is true. I'll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities. First of all, you need official transcripts of your undergraduate work, three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence, and the official TOEFL(Test of English as a Foreign Language) score (It's usually 550). Then you need a financial guarantee, and an application fee of 25 dollars.  [Person1]:  What's to come next?  [Person2]:  If they agree to enroll you, they will send you a TAP-66 Form. With TAP-66, you can apply for a passport from our government, and then apply for a visa from the US. Embassy in Beijing.  [Person1]:  How long will it take to go over all the procedures?  [Person2]:  From 3 to 6 months if everything goes well.  [Person1]:  Thank you. I appreciate your help.  [Person2]:  You are welcome. Please feel free to ask if you have any more questions. 
[Person1]:  I'd like to help pitch in with dinner. [Person2]:  Really? You're joking. [Person1]:  No. I'd like to do something special for you on your birthday. [Person2]:  I'd like that. Alright, put on this apron first. [Person1]:  OK. . . Now how can I help, hon? [Person2]:  Hmm, let me see. . . Boil some water. [Person1]:  Easy. I could do that with my eyes closed. ( after a while ) Done. [Person2]:  Not bad. Okay, now take some meat and potatoes from the fridge. [Person1]:  How many potatoes do you need? [Person2]:  Three. And bring four bell peppers. [Person1]:  Gotcha. . . OK. Here they are. [Person2]:  Now wash them, then dice the potatoes and bell peppers. [Person1]:  Where's the peeler?
[Person1]:  Excuse me, would you like a drink before your meal?  [Person2]:  Pardon me?  [Person1]:  Would you like a drink?  [Person2]:  Oh, I see. I'll have a beer please  [Person1]:  Ok, here you are.  [Person2]:  Thank you. How much is it?  [Person1]:  Well, all the drinks including beer are free of charge.  [Person2]:  Are you sure? Then I'd love more beer please. [Person1]:  Don't worry. It would be back again a little later. [Person2]:  Okay, thank you. [Person1]:  Are you finished? [Person2]:  Yes, may I have some more beer? [Person1]:  Oh, sure. I'll be back in a minute.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, but could you tell me the way to the railway station? [Person2]:  The railway station? Just go down this street and turn left at the second corner. The station is at the end of that street. [Person1]:  How long will it take me to get there? [Person2]:  It's about a ten-minute walk. [Person1]:  That's very clear. I think I can find my way now. Thank you. [Person2]:  Not at all.
[Person1]:  Hello? [Person2]:  Hi, Mr. Smith. This is Mary. Is Jenny there? [Person1]:  No, I ' m afraid not, Mary. May I take a message for her? [Person2]:  Yes, please tell her that band practice has been moved to Tuesday night at eight thirty. [Person1]:  O. K. No problem. Anything else? [Person2]:  No, but if she has any questions, she can call me at 555-2345. [Person1]:  All right, I ' ll leave her the message, Mary. Thanks for calling. [Person2]:  Thank you. Bye. [Person1]:  Goodbye.
[Person1]:  Mr. Jones, shall we now discuss the packaging? [Person2]:  Very well. You know, we have definite ways of packaging garments. As to blouses, we use a polythene wrapper for each article, all ready for window display. [Person1]:  Good. A wrapping that catches the eye will certainly help push the sales. With competition from similar garments producers, the merchandise must not only be good value but also look attractive. [Person2]:  Right you are. We'll see to it that the blouses appeal to the eye as well as to the purse. [Person1]:  What about the outer packing? [Person2]:  We'll pack them 10 dozens to one carton, gross weight around 25 kilos a carton. [Person1]:  Cartons? [Person2]:  Yes, corrugated cardboard boxes. [Person1]:  Could you use wooden cases instead? [Person2]:  Why use wooden cases? [Person1]:  I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for such a heavy load. [Person2]:  The cartons are comparatively light, and therefore easy to handle. They won't be stowed away with the heavy cargo. The stevedores will see to that. Besides, we'll reinforce the cartons with straps. Silk blouses are not fragile goods. They can stand a lot of jolting. [Person1]:  Maybe you are right, but the goods are to be transhipped at Hamburg or London. If the boxes are moved about on an open wharf, the dampness or rain may get into them. This would make the blouses spotted or ruined. [Person2]:  No need to worry about that. The cartons lined with plastic sheets are waterproof, and as the boxes are made of cardboard, they will be handled with care. [Person1]:  Well, I don't want to take any chances. Besides, cartons are easy to cut open, and this increases the risk of pilferage. [Person2]:  Tampering with cartons is easily detected. I should say that this rather discourages pilferage. [Person1]:  Maybe so, but I'm afraid that in case of damage or pilferage, the insurance company will refuse compensation on the ground of improper packing, or packing unsuitable for sea voyage. [Person2]:  But cartons are quite seaworthy. They are extensively used in our shipments to continental ports. There are never any complaints from our clients, and our insurance company has also approved such packing for W. P. A. and T. P. N. D. [Person1]:  If you could guarantee compensation in case the insurance com - any refuses to honor a claim for faulty packing, we would be quite willing to accept cartons. [Person2]:  I'm sorry, but we can't take on any responsibility that is beyond our functions and powers. We'll make sure that the packing is seaworthy, but we can't commit ourselves to being responsible for every kind of mishap. [Person1]:  I can understand your position. Perhaps I'm asking too much. [Person2]:  We'll use wooden cases if you insist, but the charge for packing will be considerably higher, and it also slows delivery. [Person1]:  Well, I'll call you immediately for instructions on the matter. [Person2]:  Please do. I'll be waiting for your reply.
[Person1]:  You're in great shape, Keith. Do you work out at a gym? [Person2]:  Yeah, I do. I guess I'm a real fitness freak. [Person1]:  So, how often do you work out? [Person2]:  Well, I do aerobics every day after work. And then I play racquetball. [Person1]:  Say, I like racquetball, too. [Person2]:  Oh, do you want to play sometime? [Person1]:  Uh. . . how well do you play? [Person2]:  Pretty well, I guess. [Person1]:  Well, all right. But I'm not very good. [Person2]:  No problem, Rod. I won't play too hard.
[Person1]:  David, recently I established a travelling forum, and now I want to make a plan to hold the first activity. Where can we go for this time? [Person2]:  How many members are there in your forum? [Person1]:  a dozen. [Person2]:  I think we can visit West Lake. The landscapes are attractive. It is said that just as there is paradise in heaven, there are Su Zhou and Hang Zhou on earth. [Person1]:  It's surely worth going to. There are ten famous spots there. [Person2]:  Great, let's say Hang Zhou is the place. What can we do next after locating the place? [Person1]:  Inform my members to prepare for the travelling to Hang Zhou. And then we can discuss about the travelling costs.
[Person1]:  I'll talk to you later. [Person2]:  What's the rush? [Person1]:  I have to get off the phone now. [Person2]:  I'm not ready to get off the phone with you. [Person1]:  There are other things I need to take care of. [Person2]:  What is it that you need to do? [Person1]:  Please don't be nosey. [Person2]:  I'm not being nosey, it's just a question. [Person1]:  You don't need to worry about that. [Person2]:  That was mean to say. [Person1]:  I am very sorry, but I must go. [Person2]:  I guess.

[Person1]:  What are you doing, karen? [Person2]:  I'm making a shopping-list, Tom. [Person1]:  What do we need? [Person2]:  We need a lot of things this week. I must go to the grocer's. We haven't got much tea or coffee, and we haven't got any sugar or jam. [Person1]:  What about vegetables? [Person2]:  I must go to the greengrocer's. We haven ; t got many tomatoes, but we've got a lot of potatoes. I must go to the butcher's, too. We need some meat. We haven't got any meat at all. [Person1]:  Have we got any beer and wine? [Person2]:  No, we haven't. And I'm not going to get any! [Person1]:  I hope that you've got some money. [Person2]:  I haven't got much. [Person1]:  Well, I haven't got much either!
[Person1]:  I hear you're moving to New York. [Person2]:  Yes, I found a very good job down there. [Person1]:  Well, we'll certainly miss you in Boston. [Person2]:  I'm going to miss you folks, too. [Person1]:  Let's keep in touch. [Person2]:  OK. I'll drop you a line as soon as I get there.
[Person1]:  Good evening. Where have you come from? [Person2]:  Bucharest, Romania. [Person1]:  May I have your passport and form I - 94, please? [Person2]:  Here you are. [Person1]:  What's the nature of your visit? Business or pleasure? [Person2]:  Pleasure. I'm visiting my relatives. [Person1]:  How long are you going to stay in the United States? [Person2]:  Three weeks. [Person1]:  What is your occupation? [Person2]:  I work as an accountant for a Romanian telecommunications company. [Person1]:  Do you have a return ticket? [Person2]:  Yes, here it is. [Person1]:  That's fine. Thanks. Enjoy your trip. [Person2]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  What kinds of meat are most popular in your country? [Person2]:  We usually eat chicken, pork and beef. you eat these meat a lot in your country too, don't you? [Person1]:  Yes, we do. we also eat mutton. [Person2]:  I've heard that people in your country like mutton chops. [Person1]:  That's right, mutton chops taste so good, we eat them with sauce, have you ever tried? [Person2]:  Yes, I have, I tried once when I visited your country last year, I think they were very tasty. Can you cook them? [Person1]:  Certainly I can, I'll buy some from butchers'and cook for you next sunday. [Person2]:  That sounds great. I'll bring a bottle of wine then.
[Person1]:  How did you like the fireworks last night? [Person2]:  I really didn't enjoy them too much. There was such a big crowd that we couldn't get very close. [Person1]:  I thought you were going early. [Person2]:  We did, but even though we got there at ten to eight, the park was already filled with lots of people. It was so crowded that we had a hard time finding a place even to stand. [Person1]:  That's too bad, because the fireworks were really wonderful. [Person2]:  What did you do? How did you manage to get a good view? [Person1]:  We went early. We decided to have a picnic so we'd be sure to get there early enough to find a good place. [Person2]:  I guess that's what I should do next Fourth of July. [Person1]:  We found a place on top of some rocks where nobody could get in front of us. We could appreciate the fireworks perfectly. [Person2]:  What did you do about going home? I've never been pushed so much in my whole life! [Person1]:  Oh, we stayed around for an hour or so, but they ran extra buses until midnight, so we didn't have any problem. [Person2]:  I think you were lucky. I hope I will be just as lukcy as you next year. [Person1]:  It wasn't lucky. It was good planning. You'll have to come with us next year.
[Person1]:  Frank, are you happy? I mean you have a big house and you have a car. [Person2]:  I don't know, Lisa. A lot of people also have houses and cars. [Person1]:  You mean you want to have more than other people and this will make you happy? [Person2]:  Possibly. [Person1]:  Then you're looking for relative happiness. [Person2]:  Ok, Lisa, what do you think is happiness? [Person1]:  Well, through the centuries, people have offered quite different definitions of happiness such as happy people were married women and single men, or happiness meant serf-gratification, or happiness could be achieved by eating less or eating more. [Person2]:  So happiness is rather elusive? [Person1]:  I think the happiest people are those who find joy in their daily lives, and who enjoy their friendships, families, work and hobbies. [Person2]:  You mean they are not bothered by the desire to get something more, something new, something better? [Person1]:  You couldn't be more correct. One more thing, Frank, if you are happy, you may not be satisfied with your life. [Person2]:  What do you mean? [Person1]:  Happiness often means how happy you feel with your life now. Satisfaction often means that people have to take a step back from their lives and look at them in general.
[Person1]:  Now you've seen this table of figures about the pocket money children in Britain get? [Person2]:  Yes. I thought it was quite interesting, but I don't quite understand the column entitled change. Can you explain what it means? [Person1]:  Well, I think it means the change from the year before. I am not a mathematician, but I assume the rise from 70p to 90p is a rise of 25 percent. [Person2]:  Oh yes, I see. And the inflation rate is there for comparison. [Person1]:  Yes. Why do you think the rise in pocket money is often higher than inflation? [Person2]:  I am sorry I've no idea. Perhaps parents in Britain are too generous. [Person1]:  Perhaps they are. But it looks as if children were not better off in 2001 than they were in 2002. That's strange, isn't it? And they seem to have been better off in 2003 than they are now. I wonder why that is. [Person2]:  Yes, I don't understand that at all. [Person1]:  Anyway, if you had children, how much pocket money would you give them? [Person2]:  I don't know. I think I'll probably give them 2 pounds a week. [Person1]:  Would you? And what would you expect them to do with it? [Person2]:  Well, out of that, they have to buy some small personal things, but I wouldn't expect them to save to buy their own socks, for example. [Person1]:  Yes. By the way, do most children in your country get pocket money? [Person2]:  Yeah, they do.
[Person1]:  What are you going to do after you return from Washington? [Person2]:  I'm going to stay in the city. [Person1]:  What will you do all day? [Person2]:  I'm going to work with my father at the store. In the evening, I'll read books. On weekends, I'll go to the beach with my family. [Person1]:  Have you ever worked? [Person2]:  No, but I can learn. What are you going to do this summer? [Person1]:  I'm going to camp. I've gone to camp for four summers. [Person2]:  I've never gone to camp. What do you do there? [Person1]:  We do many things. In the morning, we go swimming and boating. In the afternoon, we play basketball or tennis. We sit around a camp fire at night. We sing or tell stories. [Person2]:  That sounds wonderful. [Person1]:  It is wonderful. What's John going to do this summer? [Person2]:  I think he's going to the mountains with his parents. [Person1]:  Well, so long, Mary. Have fun. [Person2]:  You too, Peter. Give my regards to John. I'll see you in September.
[Person1]:  Good afternoon, Mr. Brown. I'm planning to take 3 weeks leave in January. [Person2]:  3 weeks. You know we will be so busy next month. Could you put it off until February? [Person1]:  Sorry, I can't. Mr. Brown, I have already finished my work for next month. [Person2]:  I see, you want to travel abroad or prepare for your wedding. [Person1]:  Not really. I want to go to see my parents in China. We celebrate the Spring Festival in January this year. And it's our tradition to have a family reunion then. [Person2]:  Alright. I'll do my best to meet your request. [Person1]:  That's very kind of you. Thank you very much. [Person2]:  No problem. By the way, when you're in China, would you buy a glass face for my wife? [Person1]:  Of course, I'd be happy to. I remember her hobby.
[Person1]:  What time is it? [Person2]:  Ten to nine. [Person1]:  Your watch is ten minutes slow. So it's should be nine sharp. I'm gonna be late again. What will be my excuse this time? It should be set the alarm for seven thirty. [Person2]:  Don't cry over spilled milk, Fred? Could you stay with me a few minutes? [Person1]:  What? Why? What's wrong with you? [Person2]:  I just hate being alone at home with nothing to do about listen to the clock ticking.It ' s so lonely and boring. My sickness makes it worse. When will I recover? [Person1]:  You will be fine in the couple of month, just be patient. I've got to woke now, I'll be late. [Person2]:  You only care about your work. [Person1]:  Sorry, baby, you are everything to me. all I do just for our family. [Person2]:  Stay just a few minutes longer, OK? [Person1]:  OK, I'll leave at 9 [Person2]:  Yes. [Person1]:  I'll spent more time with you in the future, Dina. [Person2]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  Wow, this is amazing. I'm glad we've come here. So cool. [Person2]:  I always love skiing. You know, it's a cool game for cool people. Stay with me and you will be cool, too. [Person1]:  Hey, look over there. It seems that there is something interesting going on. Let's go and have a look. [Person2]:  Sure. It's probably the skiing show. Adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors. [Person1]:  See that. It's so dangerous. My mom would never allow me to do that. [Person2]:  Hey, don't be so pathetic. It's a maximal sports show. What else can they do to attract more visitors? Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show. [Person1]:  You are right. But what if the avalanche happened? [Person2]:  They are all very experienced and great skiers. So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim. [Person1]:  Anyway, the show is breathtaking. By the way, where did they get so much snow in here? [Person2]:  Don't you know that? Are you kidding me? [Person1]:  Hey, not everyone is as lucky as you to have a father who is a scientist. [Person2]:  Sorry. Well, they have the most advanced snowmaking machine. [Person1]:  Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution? [Person2]:  It's possible. But the boss here said they were doing whatever they can. [Person1]:  It's a good thing. OK, let's go skiing. [Person2]:  Here we go.
[Person1]:  Taxi! [Person2]:  Yes, sir. Where to? [Person1]:  The city square, please. [Person2]:  Are you in a hurry? [Person1]:  Yes, I have to be there to meet a friend at 5 thirty pm. So we're sure we can get there on time? [Person2]:  I'm afraid not, sir. Generally we can, but you know how it is in the rush hour now. [Person1]:  I see. Here's the extra 5 $ for you if you can get me there on time. [Person2]:  All right. I'll do my best. [Person1]:  Oh.we made it. Thank you. How much do I own you? [Person2]:  The reading on the kilometer is 12 $. [Person1]:  Here's the money, keep the changes, please. [Person2]:  Do you need a receipt? [Person1]:  No, thank you.
[Person1]:  Is there a daily passenger ship to Dalian? [Person2]:  Yes. [Person1]:  How many days does it take to Dalian? [Person2]:  About one day. It arrives in Dalian at 10 [Person1]:  How many ports do we call at on our passage to Qingdao? [Person2]:  Four ports. [Person1]:  The ship is going very fast. [Person2]:  Perhaps she makes about 25 knots an hour. [Person1]:  The sea is calm and peaceful. A sea trip is always enjoyable in fine weather like this. [Person2]:  Yes. I hope it will remain fine all the way.
[Person1]:  I usually bowl with an eight ball. I like the control of a light ball. I can spin it more, so that the ball hooks. [Person2]:  Well. I like them a little heavier. I don't have as much control, usually bowling straight, but the extra momentum compensates for that. [Person1]:  Well, let's see which technique is better. I think I'll go up first. . . Yes! I hit a strike. I knocked them all down on my first bowl. [Person2]:  Well done. You got them all. You get 10 points and your next two bowls are added to this frame's score. I'II dry my ball off and try to knock them all down as well. [Person1]:  Good start. You knocked eight pins down. But you are left with a 7, 10 split. Unless you can bowl a UFO-ball on this bowl, it is going to be impossible. [Person2]:  I certainly can try. . . No! It went straight through the wickets.
[Person1]:  Hi Mark. [Person2]:  Oh, hi Stacy. [Person1]:  How was your summer vacation? [Person2]:  I worked over the summer at a restaurant. Have to make tuition money, right? What did you do? [Person1]:  I took summer school. I withdrew from two of my classes last year so I wanted to make them up. [Person2]:  So are you officially a junior now? [Person1]:  Yeah. And I have 5 credits to spare. I only needed to take 10 credits over the summer, but I took 15 because the price was the same. [Person2]:  That makes sense. So where is Nicole? [Person1]:  She dropped out of school completely. [Person2]:  Really? Why? [Person1]:  She worked at a startup company as an intern and since the business did well, they asked her if she wanted to work full time. [Person2]:  Wow. She's so lucky. She doesn't have a degree and she already has a job. [Person1]:  It sounds good now, but I'm traditional. I want the degree, so I wouldn't have accepted the offer. [Person2]:  Do you know how much they are paying her? [Person1]:  I don't know. But I bet it must have been a good offer, or she wouldn't have accepted it.
[Person1]:  I would love to be famous and have thousands of adoring fans. [Person2]:  Really? I'm not sure that I would like all the attention. There have been numerous cases of paparazzi interfering with star's private live in recent years. [Person1]:  I love being photographed! If I were famous, I'd do interviews for all the top magazines, like cosmo and elle. [Person2]:  I wouldn't mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice, but it would get tedious after a while. Imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you. [Person1]:  No-one really believes gossip columnists. [Person2]:  I think you'll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns. You'd also have to be very careful about every word you said. If you appeared on a chat show and said something silly, it [Person1]:  I think you're right about that. I'd need a good manager to be my spokesperson. I could do a lot of charity work, which would help a lot of people. [Person2]:  That's a great idea. Which charities would you support? [Person1]:  I love children, as you know, so probably a children's charity. [Person2]:  You'd have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity, so you'd really need to be very careful. Anyway, I'd be the first to buy your posters and I'd attend your first book - [Person1]:  Thanks, but actually I was hoping I could ask you to write my biography.
[Person1]:  Good day, Madam. What service do you require today? [Person2]:  I'd like some info about your Payroll Services, please. [Person1]:  It's possible to sign an agreement with us, and then we can pay your staff directly. That is called an Entrustment Agreement. [Person2]:  I see. How is it paid? I mean, what payment methods are possible? [Person1]:  We can transfer the funds each month, at your request, into each employee's account. It is possible to pay in cash or to pay directly to the employee's savings account, no matter which bank they do business with. [Person2]:  That sounds pretty good. Tell me, must we use the same payment method for all of our employees? [Person1]:  Not at all. We can adjust the payment methods depending on the requirement of each employee. [Person2]:  That sounds just perfect. I'll talk things over with some colleagues and get back to you. Thank you very much for the information.
[Person1]:  Credit Services, how can I help you? [Person2]:  I'd like to apply for a credit card with you. [Person1]:  Would that be our standard card, our gold card, or our platinum card? [Person2]:  Oh, I'm not sure. What's the difference? [Person1]:  Well, the standard card has a lower credit limit, that's 20, 000 RIB, whereas with the platinum card you can have a credit limit of 80, 000 RIB. [Person2]:  Why such a big difference? [Person1]:  It's all about credit rating and salary. If your credit rating and your salary are high enough, we can offer you the platinum card. [Person2]:  My salary is pretty high and I've never had a problem with my credit rating in the past. Are there any perks of the platinum card? [Person1]:  Yes, we have contracts with various luxury shops and health clubs, where if you use the card to purchase items from them, you can get some healthy discounts. [Person2]:  That's great ; my health club membership is about to expire.
[Person1]:  Well, this is certainly a nice place, Mr. Taylor. What sort of public transportation is nearby? [Person2]:  Please, call my John. Well, there's a subway stop and bus station just around the corner. Do you have children? [Person1]:  Yes, two. [Person2]:  Well, in that case, the schools in this area are very good. [Person1]:  We send our kids to private school, but that's good to know too. [Person2]:  Oh, well. As far as other conveniences in the neighborhood, there's a grocery store just up the block, and there's lots of little shops nearby. [Person1]:  Great. Well, we'll have to think about it, but the place looks great. [Person2]:  Here's my card, just give me a call if you're interested.
[Person1]:  Good evening. [Person2]:  Good evening. We've a reservation for a table for four. My name is Tim. [Person1]:  Let me check the list. Yes, we do have a reservation under Mr. Tim. [Person2]:  But there is a change in the number of people. There are seven of us. Three of my friends are coming soon. [Person1]:  It doesn't matter. Follow me, please. What do you think of the table in the center of the dining room? [Person2]:  Well, it's a window table that we've booked. [Person1]:  I'm sorry, but you see, all the tables by the window are small, with up to 4 seats. [Person2]:  Oh, I see. We'll have to make up with the center one. [Person1]:  Thank you for your understanding, Mr. Tim. [Person2]:  If a Mr. Wu comes to look for me, just take him here. [Person1]:  Yes, I will.
[Person1]:  One thing I love our boss for is that he always knows when to give you a pay raise without being asked for. [Person2]:  Really? How can he be so sure about the timing? [Person1]:  He just knows either by your excellent performance at work or by the annual review. [Person2]:  Well. This must save lots of employees from worrying about how to write a salary increase letter. You know how tough it is. Do all the employees receive the same pay increase annually? [Person1]:  Actually not! Our company pays for performance. [Person2]:  I like this system. It will encourage the best employees and motivate those who want to make a change at work.
[Person1]:  Excuse me. Can you do me a favor? [Person2]:  What's your problem? [Person1]:  I just can not find the right place here. I've never been here before. [Person2]:  You must be a freshman. What do you want anyway? [Person1]:  I want to find a book that I need for my term paper, but I cannot find it anywhere. [Person2]:  The library has five reading rooms. You may try the General Reading Room. You can find almost all the books there. But you can not take the book out of the reading room. [Person1]:  It doesn't matter. I just want to refer to it for some figures. Where is it? [Person2]:  Go out of this building, cross the sports field, and you will see a white house. The General Reading Room is inside it. [Person1]:  No wonder! It's not here! Thank you very much. [Person2]:  My pleasure!
[Person1]:  Have you any round-neck sweater?  [Person2]:  Yes. Actually our range of sweaters is the most comprehensive available.  [Person1]:  Can I try this one on?  [Person2]:  Sure, go ahead.  [Person1]:  The color is too bright. For my age, I would prefer a lighter color. 
[Person1]:  Hi, long time no see. How have you been?  [Person2]:  Oh, I've been fine, but I'm having some trouble with my son.  [Person1]:  Tell me all about it.  [Person2]:  Oh, he's 14 and in the past few months, he's become quieter and a bit secretive. He locks himself in his room and I think he's running around with the wrong crowd.  [Person1]:  Oh, I see. What makes you think that?  [Person2]:  Well, he's become friends with a couple of older boys who are in a band. And one night last weekend, he came home really late, way past his curfew.  [Person1]:  Really? What happened?  [Person2]:  He told me that his friend's car broke down and they had to walk home.  [Person1]:  I see what you mean. I understand why you're concerned. Have you tried talking to your son about it?  [Person2]:  I haven't yet. I just keep hoping it's just a phase he's going through.  [Person1]:  You may be right, but it doesn't hurt to find out more about what's going on in his life.  [Person2]:  You're right. I should talk to him. Sometimes, it's not easy being a parent. Thanks. It helps to get it off my chest. You're always so easy to talk to.  [Person1]:  I don't know about that, but my door is always open. Stop by anytime. 
[Person1]:  7824145 Jean Williamson speaking. [Person2]:  Hi dear, sorry I had to rush off this morning. How are the boys? [Person1]:  I'm taking them to the doctor at 12 [Person2]:  That's good. What about you? [Person1]:  Oh I'm fine now. I'm going to bake a birthday cake for tomorrow and I've already bought it Camera for Peter and some records for Paul. [Person2]:  I hope we aren't spoiling them too much. You know, I've been thinking of opening a savings account for them, they need to learn how to save money.
[Person1]:  Peter, hi. [Person2]:  Hi, Cindy. [Person1]:  Great to see you again. Welcome to London. [Person2]:  Thanks. It's great to be here finally. [Person1]:  So how are you? How was your journey? [Person2]:  Well, the flight was 45 minutes late but after that it was fine. Its service was very good, the inflight movies were really cool. But there wasn't much food. So I'm kind of hungry now. [Person1]:  Oh, you poor thing. Well, it will be a long drive home so why don't we get some breakfast around here first? Look, there's a restaurant over there.
[Person1]:  What kind of gas does this car take? [Person2]:  I don't know. It's a rental. [Person1]:  I will give you premium unleaded. Alright? [Person2]:  Sure, why not? [Person1]:  That is the pump you are in front of. [Person2]:  Is it expensive? [Person1]:  It is the most expensive. [Person2]:  Well, I don't want it then. Can I move to another pump? [Person1]:  Yes, I can give you regular unleaded. But you have to back up the car a little. [Person2]:  Give me regular unleaded then. I will back up. Can you wash my windows for me? [Person1]:  I'm sorry, sir. This is not a full service gas station. I will help you fill the gas, but we don't wash windows here. [Person2]:  Really? Well, I guess I have to get used to it.
[Person1]:  Hey, Tom, I want to learn how to play golf. [Person2]:  You're really sporty! [Person1]:  I want to do everything I can. [Person2]:  Do you have clubs? [Person1]:  No. Can I rent clubs? [Person2]:  There are clubs for beginners. It's cheaper to buy those rather than rent them a few times. [Person1]:  What kinds of clubs? [Person2]:  Like the seven-piece set. It's only $ 120. [Person1]:  I'll buy a set. But you have to teach me. [Person2]:  Okay.
[Person1]:  What date is today? [Person2]:  Why? [Person1]:  Didn't you notice the roses everywhere? [Person2]:  I hear it's Chinese Valentine's Day! Don't you know? [Person1]:  Oh, God. I just forgot it. I should have brought roses for my girlfriend. [Person2]:  It's not too late. Go to buy some now.
[Person1]:  Hello, let me introduce myself. I'm your neighbor. My name is Shirley. [Person2]:  Hi, Shirley. I'm Sophie. It's nice to meet you. [Person1]:  Nice to meet you, too. [Person2]:  Please come in. [Person1]:  Here is a little gift for your family. It's a calendar with all the community events on it. I hope it can be helpful. [Person2]:  I really appreciate it. [Person1]:  Since we are neighbors, if you need any help or anything, please come to me. [Person2]:  I will. Actually, I am worried so much about the security of this community because my house has been burgled twice before. [Person1]:  Oh, don't worry about that here. There are security guards on duty 24 hours a day and they patrol all over the neighborhood. You know, they are all very strong. [Person2]:  Really? That's good. Is there any supermarket in our neighborhood? [Person1]:  Of course. There is a Carrefour near the neighborhood. I'll show you there if you want to. [Person2]:  That's terrific! [Person1]:  By the way, a party will be held for new neighbors the day after tomorrow. I hope I can see you there. [Person2]:  Yeah, and we can get to know each other at the party.
[Person1]:  Fair-Priced Fares, how may I help you? [Person2]:  How much is a round-trip ticket to London? [Person1]:  When did you plan to go, sir? [Person2]:  In the second week of September. [Person1]:  The second week of September is still in the high-season, so the cheapest tickets are $ 650. The high season lasts until the 15th, so fares after that date are cheaper. [Person2]:  In that case, I'll go after the 15th. How much are the off-season fares? [Person1]:  Our cheapest ticket is $ 550 on American Airlines. [Person2]:  Okay, I'll take it. ( to be continued )
[Person1]:  There are some things I miss. But I love Chinese food. And I think the people in Taiwan are really hospitable. Besides, I grew up in Los Angeles, so I'm used to living in crowded places. Why are you going to America? [Person2]:  I'm going to New York to visit my sister. She is in art school. I've never been to New York before. I'm kind of scared. [Person1]:  Why? [Person2]:  Well, I know a lot of people have guns there. I think maybe it isn't too safe. [Person1]:  Don't worry about it. Your sister lives there. She probably knows the places in town you shouldn't go. It's true there are some dangerous places in big American cities. But if your sister lives there, she must know the city pretty well already. [Person2]:  Yes, I'm not really scared. Maybe only a little. [Person1]:  Don't believe what you see on TV. You will have a good time in New York. What things do you want to see? [Person2]:  I want to see the museums, and I want to shop a lot. [Person1]:  The museums are excellent. And the shopping! Well! I'm sure you'll spend a lot of money there. [Person2]:  Hmm. I hope not.
[Person1]:  Hi, Don. Would you like to go swimming this afternoon? [Person2]:  I wish I could, Jenny, but I have to spend the rest of the day in the library. I have a ten-page paper due tomorrow. [Person1]:  Oh, is that for Professor Smith's class? [Person2]:  Yes, I have to write an article on a poem we read in class. [Person1]:  That's hard. How is it going so far? [Person2]:  Not very well. And I also have to study a lot for maths and history. I don't know how I'm going to do it at all. [Person1]:  You know, Don. I've been doing well in maths, so I'd be happy to help you. [Person2]:  OK, Jenny, I'll see you in front of the library. [Person1]:  Good luck with the poem.
[Person1]:  Hey, Michael. Remember me? I'm Becky. We used to work at Lemans together. [Person2]:  Oh, sure. How are you? Long time no see. How are things at Lemans? [Person1]:  It's about the same. I've been thinking of making a change myself. Do you mind if I ask you a few things about your job at the university? [Person2]:  No, not at all. Go ahead. [Person1]:  Well, I was wondering what the salaries are like? I mean. . . are they much lower than the corporate world? [Person2]:  Well, I can't speak for all universities, but my salary is a definitely lower than at Lemans. I just don't think the salaries are comparable when you leave a major corporation. [Person1]:  Yeah, that's what I thought. But, I've heard that the perks are better. I was wondering if that was really true. [Person2]:  I'd have to say yes and no on that. I don't get a big end-of-the-year bonus like I did at Lemans but I get to take classes for free if I want to. I've always wanted to get a graduate degree so I'm taking classes now to do that. [Person1]:  Oh, that's great. It sounds like you're really happy with your move. [Person2]:  Yeah, I guess I am. Working at a university is really suits me.
[Person1]:  May I help you,sir? [Person2]:  Yes, please. I want to buy a personal gift for my brother. He's taking a trip to South America. [Person1]:  Is he going by ship or by plane? [Person2]:  He's flying. My gift will have to be something light in weight. What can you suggest? [Person1]:  What about this leather wallet? It's made of crocodile leather. [Person2]:  My sister has already given him one. I'd like something unusual. [Person1]:  Here is a gift for the man who has everything. [Person2]:  Oh,a folding toothbrush. That's a wonderful idea. How much is it? [Person1]:  3.
[Person1]:  We've all heard the saying 'Laughter is the best medicine.' How important is it to our health, Dr. Berk? [Person2]:  This saying has been scientifically proven! A year-long study of heart attack victims done at the Oakhurst Health Research Institute in California found that of those patients who spent half an hour a day watching comedy videos, 10 percent had a second heart attack, whereas 30 percent of those who did not watch had a second attack. [Person1]:  Wow! Laughter is really a good medicine to patients. Can you give us another example? [Person2]:  Sure! Norman Cousins, editor of the Saturday Review, learned this during a battle with an illness. He discovered that his condition improved when he enjoyed himself and watched funny movies. [Person1]:  You said Norman learned this? Do we have to learn to laugh? [Person2]:  Not necessarily. Since laughing is something people can do sitting down, costs no money, and requires no special exercise equipment or skill, it's the perfect workout for anyone who doesn't have the time or desire to participate in a regular fitness program. [Person1]:  Oh. Do you have such a program to offer to the general public? [Person2]:  Yes, we do. It's called the Smile Time-Out. You take a deep breath, smile, exhale, and say 'Aaah' while visualizing all your muscles and cells smiling. Then add to that a memory of a time you felt really good and laughed and laughed. [Person1]:  What about the situation in which you aren't in a mood to laugh? [Person2]:  Even when you fake a smile or laugh, you get the same physiological benefits as when it's the real thing, because your mind is smart, but your body is stupid and can't tell the difference!
[Person1]:  Hi, Helen, what do you think of our class in Children's Literature? [Person2]:  It looks pretty good. Are you also majoring in Elementary Education? [Person1]:  Yes. I can use this to fulfill the requirement for my course. [Person2]:  Have you finished the first assignment yet? [Person1]:  Not yet. I just bought the books today. How about you? [Person2]:  I started this afternoon. It's great fun reading those wonderful children stories by Doctor Seuss. [Person1]:  Doctor Seuss? I don't remember seeing his name on the reading list. [Person2]:  His full name's Theodore Seuss Geisel. You can find this name on the reading list. Doctor Seuss is his pen name. [Person1]:  I love reading those stories as a child. It'll be interesting to read them now from a different point of view. I guess they'll give me a good idea of how children think. [Person2]:  Those stories are also great for classroom use. [Person1]:  How's that? [Person2]:  Well, take a typical Doctor Seuss's book like The Cat in the Hat. It has a controlled vocabulary of only two hundred words. [Person1]:  So that means the children get lots of practices using a small number of words over and over again. [Person2]:  Exactly. In fact The Cat in the Hat was written mainly to show how a controlled-vocabulary book could also be interesting and fun. [Person1]:  Well, it sounds as though this course is also going to be interesting and fun. I think I'll get started on those readings tonight.
[Person1]:  What type of music do you like to listen to?  [Person2]:  I like listening to different kinds of music.  [Person1]:  Like what, for instance?  [Person2]:  I enjoy Rock and R&B.  [Person1]:  Why is that?  [Person2]:  I like the different instruments that they use.  [Person1]:  That's a good reason to like something.  [Person2]:  Yeah, I think so too. 
[Person1]:  Can you please give me a hand? I can't carry the heavy box.  [Person2]:  I'm afraid not. Don't you see I'm looking up a word in the dictionary?  [Person1]:  I think you are flicking through it.  [Person2]:  Well, wait a minute. 
[Person1]:  Are there many idioms in English?  [Person2]:  There are hundreds and hundreds. English is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions.  [Person1]:  Can you give us an example?  [Person2]:  I'll look up the rate. To look up doesn't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof. It means to search for and find some information.  [Person1]:  What about the expression goodbye? Is that an idiom?  [Person2]:  That is just a natural, grammatical English expression. It has a direct translation in other languages.  [Person1]:  This is interesting, Ms. Parker. 
[Person1]:  Look at this armchair, what do you think? [Person2]:  Oh, I'm not sure I like the design. It's too heavy looking. Is it comfortable? [Person1]:  Try it. [Person2]:  Uhm, It's really comfortable. And I'd like to have something this size. Our old armchair is way too small. This size is perfect. [Person1]:  What do you think of the color? [Person2]:  Well, green isn't my favorite color, but it's better than that terrible brown one we have now. It's OK I guess. But blue would be perfect. [Person1]:  How much is it? [Person2]:  Oh no, it's $999. That's really too expensive. We can't afford it right now. [Person1]:  I know. Why don't we wait till next month for their midyear sale? It might be cheaper then. [Person2]:  Hey, that's a good idea.
[Person1]:  Have you traveled much in Britain? [Person2]:  No, not much. But I travel quite a lot in London every day. [Person1]:  What do you think of the London traffic? [Person2]:  I think the London underground is OK because it's fast and comfortable, but I also like your London buses, especially for short journeys. [Person1]:  But don't you think the buses are rather slow? [Person2]:  Yes, I do, particularly in rush hour. [Person1]:  What about London taxis? [Person2]:  Taxis often get caught in traffic jams,and besides, fared too expensive. [Person1]:  Well, what do you think is the best way to travel in London? [Person2]:  Ah, the London underground I think.
[Person1]:  Hi grandma, I'm calling to say happy birthday, I hope you're having a good day. [Person2]:  Thank you. Michael. It's great to hear from you. It's been awhile since we've talked. [Person1]:  I know grandma. I'm sorry I've been so busy with school and activities lately. I'm captain of the basketball team this year and I'm also applying to colleges for next fall. [Person2]:  Oh, Michael, I'm so proud of you, you're a very accomplished young man. Do you know where you want to go to college? [Person1]:  I really want to go to the University of Southern California, but they might not let me in. It's a very good school and it's very difficult to be accepted there. [Person2]:  Well, I'm sure they will take you, honey. You're a special young man. You've really made your grandfather and me so proud.
[Person1]:  Hello, Tom. How are you finding teaching here? [Person2]:  I get the feeling that somehow the school successful. The buildings and furniture are so old, yet amazingly, the students seem happy. These days you can't compete in less you can really provide the best. That's the trouble with these small family owned schools, so many are taken over by large companies. They seem to offer a whole range of subjects, not just English and maths. [Person1]:  I think that's good. Because they can bring together a mixture of teachers of different subjects. A geography teacher say might give you fresh ideas that you can apply and teaching English or math. [Person2]:  I've always found it a real eye opener talking to other English teachers, because people's methods of teaching the same subject can vary so much. Actually, I sometimes feel that about classes. I feel it's my role as the teacher to make sure we get on all right, but I can't always do it. [Person1]:  Each class develops its own culture, and you may not be able to do anything about it. You just have to accept that you don't get on with every class. I couldn't get on with every class, either.
[Person1]:  Hey, Jason, I hear you're being sent to France for a new position. [Person2]:  Wow, that was fast. I hardly told anyone. The boss just told me a few hours ago. Lily, Katie doesn't know yet in fact. [Person1]:  Really? So why wait? When are you going to give her the big news? [Person2]:  Well, she is teaching at the moment. She doesn't finish until 3 [Person1]:  Well, I lived there in two thousand and ten. It's not that different from the US. The weather is the same and the local people have similar customs, but the food is much better in France. What about your family? Are they all moving with you? [Person2]:  I hope to move everyone in a few months. I definitely don't like the idea of spending my year without Katie and our kids. [Person1]:  Well, that's what a lot of people in our department say I suppose. [Person2]:  Yeah, only time will tell. I'll buy you sandwiches, OK? [Person1]:  No, no, it's my treat.
[Person1]:  What do you think about this store? I heard it ' s a posh store that ' s only got branches in big cities. [Person2]:  I love this store. The only problem is that it ' s extremely expensive. [Person1]:  Don ' t worry. I ' Ve decided that for your birthday I ' m going to take you shopping for a new dress. [Person2]:  Really? I thought you hated shopping? [Person1]:  I do, that ' s why you should appreciate this gift! [Person2]:  Sure. That ' s really nice of you. Let ' s go in and try some things on. [Person1]:  How about this red dress? I think it would really suit you. [Person2]:  That ' s gorgeous! Do they have it in a size 8? [Person1]:  Here you go. On any other day, it would cost me a fortune, but it ' s on special offer today. [Person2]:  I think this color isn ' t quite right for me. Do they have the same dress in white? [Person1]:  Let me look. Let ' s see... they ' Ve got one in blue, green, pink, black... and white. Here you are. [Person2]:  This is perfect! What do you think? [Person1]:  I think you look fantastic. Happy Birthday! [Person2]:  I ' m so lucky. You only get a chance like this once in a blue moon! Thanks honey!
[Person1]:  Excuse me. Is this where I catch the bus for the zoo? [Person2]:  Well, you can take the No. 36 bus from here, but then you have to walk about 30 minutes. [Person1]:  That doesn't sound too bad. [Person2]:  Actually, if you go to the bus stop in the next block, you can take bus 301 which will let you right off in front of the zoo. [Person1]:  Maybe that's what I'll do. Thanks a lot. [Person2]:  You're welcome.
[Person1]:  Good morning, madam. I think I'm lost here. The place I want to go to is a hotel called the Hilton. [Person2]:  Do you know in which area? [Person1]:  No, I am sorry I have no idea. I am a stranger here. [Person2]:  I see. Well, do you know anything near the hotel? [Person1]:  Oh, yes. My friend told me the hotel was near the Central Railway Station. [Person2]:  Then you'll have to take a bus and get off at the Central Railway Station. [Person1]:  Can you show me where the Central Railway Station is on this map? [Person2]:  OK.
[Person1]:  Hi, Sandra. how was your weekend? [Person2]:  Great! I went hiking in the mountains on Saturday. [Person1]:  Fantastic! how was that? [Person2]:  Really good! you should try it sometime. [Person1]:  I might. what did you do yesterday? [Person2]:  Uh, nothing much, just went to bed early. I was still tired from Saturday.
[Person1]:  What's Ron Marston like, Pauline? [Person2]:  He's awful! He telephoned me four times yesterday, and three times the day before yesterday. He telephoned the office yesterday morning and yesterday afternoon. My boss answered the telephone. [Person1]:  What did your boss say to him? [Person2]:  He said, Pauline is typing letters. She can't speak to you now! ' Then I arrived home at six o'clock yesterday evening. He telephoned again. But I didn't answer the phone! [Person1]:  Did he telephone again last night? [Person2]:  Yes, he did. He telephoned at nine o'clock. [Person1]:  What did you say to him? [Person2]:  I said, This is Pauline's mother. Please don't telephone my daughter again! [Person1]:  Did he telephone again? [Person2]:  No, he didn't!
[Person1]:  What upsets you? [Person2]:  My parents called. As usual, they reminded me again that I should have a plan to marry by my late 20s. Easier said then done. Who should I marry? I have no time to go on a date. [Person1]:  It is not your mother finding one for you? [Person2]:  I will find one myself, of course. I'm a modern girl. [Person1]:  Perhaps you can try the three minutes date, the latest type. [Person2]:  You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol, I hate that idea. [Person1]:  No, there is an updated virgin, three minutes video date. I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam, you can sigh for it. You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes. [Person2]:  I don't think it makes sense. Three minutes is such a short time. [Person1]:  I think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone, so-called love at first sight. [Person2]:  Anyway, I don't want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that. [Person1]:  Don't worry. There are many other options using the internet as dating methods. Some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications. Of course, for these sites, you have to pay a membership fee. But all in all, it is more serious and professional. The chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher. [Person2]:  I don't want to post my personal information on the internet. I'm not knowing who is reading it.
[Person1]:  I am sorry for damaging your car, sir. [Person2]:  Don't worry about it. Just leave it to the insurance companies. [Person1]:  The car park in this community is over crowded, isn't it? [Person2]:  Yeah, more and more cars. People should try to take public transportation. [Person1]:  There aren't enough buses in this city, are there? [Person2]:  Yeah, sometimes I really feel like writing a letter to the mayor. [Person1]:  That's too much of hassle. We just want a little bigger parking space. [Person2]:  Have you taken this to the property management, yet? [Person1]:  No. but I'm gonna. You know, several months ago, I backed into red Honda when parking. [Person2]:  Where? On the road? [Person1]:  No, right here in the parking lot. It was parked right here in your space. The left rearview mirror was smashed. [Person2]:  Is the car owner a lady with deafening voice? [Person1]:  Yes! How do you know that? [Person2]:  That's my wife!
[Person1]:  Which kinds of meat are most popular in your country? [Person2]:  We eat a lot of chicken, pork and beef. You eat those meat a lot in your country too, don't you? [Person1]:  Yes, we do. We also eat a lot of lamb. [Person2]:  Yes. I'Ve heard that people in your country like to eat lamb chops. [Person1]:  That's right. They taste so good. We eat them with mint sauce. Have you ever tried them? [Person2]:  Yes, I have. I tried them when I visited your country last year. I thought they were very tasty. Can you cook them? [Person1]:  I certainly can. If I can get some from the butchers, I'll cook them for you. [Person2]:  That sounds great. I'll boring a bottle of wine.
[Person1]:  Look! Allen has the mic! [Person2]:  I thought he only liked to listen! [Person1]:  That was before he heard Stanley sing! I guess he couldn't stand it any more, so he decided to give it a try himself! [Person2]:  ( Sound of Allen singing ) Hey, Allen has a really good voice! He sounds like Johnny Dean! [Person1]:  And he can move. too! He dances like Ricky Martin!
[Person1]:  Do you remember the days in our small cabin last summer? [Person2]:  Yes, of course. I especially like the walk in the mountain. [Person1]:  If you'd like to, we can go there again this summer. [Person2]:  I'd love to enjoy the moment of peace out there.
[Person1]:  Hi Dave. [Hi] Happy to see you could make it. Come on in. [Person2]:  Wow. Looks like the party is in full swing. [Person1]:  Yeah. And they're eating me out of house and home. Oh, I'd like you to meet my sister, Carol. She's visiting for the weekend. [Person2]:  Oh. Which one is she? [Person1]:  She's sitting on the sofa over there. [Person2]:  You mean the woman wearing the red sweater with the long black hair? [Person1]:  Yeah. That's right. Let me introduce you to her. I just know you two will hit it off. You're both so outgoing and adventurous. [Person2]:  Uh, and who's the man sitting next to her? Uh, the man with the suit jacket and flashy green tie? [Person1]:  Oh, that's Bob, my karate teacher. [Person2]:  Karate teacher! I never knew you were into karate. [Person1]:  Yeah, I started about two months ago. Come on. I'd like you to meet them.
[Person1]:  Uncle, have a heart, please lend your new car to me. Only once.  [Person2]:  Where are you going?  [Person1]:  I have a big date tonight.  [Person2]:  You have got a car, haven't you?  [Person1]:  Oh, please. Only once lend your new car to me. 
[Person1]:  Did you get your new schedule? Let me see. I want to know if we are in some of the same classes. [Person2]:  Sure. Hey, luck, we're both in CAP together. I'm not sure what it is, but let's sit together. [Person1]:  It is called career and personal planning. Every grade 12 student has to take it. [Person2]:  Do you know what it's all about? [Person1]:  It teaches us about the business world. You know how to write a resume and how to find a job. It also helps us discover our strengths, weaknesses and interests. [Person2]:  Oh, I see. So since I am curious and like adventure, I might be a good reporter. What do you think is your best quality? [Person1]:  I'd say, you can always count on me if you need something, and I always do what I say I'm going to do. [Person2]:  Great. [Person1]:  We also have to volunteer at a job for one weekend. If you want, I can get you a job at my dad's athletic store. [Person2]:  I'd rather work with someone I know. My brother is building his house right now and he could use the help. [Person1]:  Anyway, it certainly won't be dull. At least it teaches us life skills. [Person2]:  I agree. I'm still trying to figure out why algebra is so important.
[Person1]:  Hello. May I help you? [Person2]:  Well, my winter vacation is coming up in a few days and I want to take a trip with my wife. [Person1]:  Do you want to go abroad? [Person2]:  Yeah, I'd like to go to a foreign country. My wife wants to go to any place sunny. We won't visit Africa though. [Person1]:  How much money would you like to spend on the trip? [Person2]:  It better not be more than $3000. [Person1]:  I think sunny Florida is a good choice. [Person2]:  Florida is not exactly our idea of a great vacation. What about someplace a little different, where few tourists go? [Person1]:  Then how about Spain or Portugal? Both are sunny and quite relaxing. [Person2]:  Spain seems better. I'll talk to my wife about it then, then return.
[Person1]:  Where do you want to go, Madam? [Person2]:  The Hilton Hotel, please? Uh, it's cold, huh? I'm freezing. [Person1]:  Come on, San Francisco's usually cold in winter, you know? It's often very rainy, which makes the weather colder. [Person2]:  Well, it gets very hot in summer, doesn't it? [Person1]:  Not really, it gets warm in July and August. That's the best time to visit the city. Ah-oh, here comes the rain. [Person2]:  It's raining hard. By the way, how long will it take us to reach the hotel? [Person1]:  About half an hour. Would you like to listen to some light music? [Person2]:  That would be lovely.
[Person1]:  Do you develop films here? [Person2]:  Yes, we shall. What size do you like? [Person1]:  Well, the 4 x 6 is fine. [Person2]:  Which do you prefer, color or black and white? [Person1]:  The last one is black and white, all the rest should need color. [Person2]:  OK. [Person1]:  I hope they will come out well. When should I pick them up? [Person2]:  They will be ready at noon tomorrow. Each negative develops one print, right? [Person1]:  Yes, it is. And develop them as glossy as possible. [Person2]:  No problem. Do you need another film? [Person1]:  Yes, a roll of Kodak film please. [Person2]:  It is totally $ 20 including the deposit for films.
[Person1]:  This is the Bell Captain's Desk. May I help you? [Person2]:  Yes, I've been waiting for my bags to be sent up for the last half hour. Where are they? [Person1]:  I'm very sorry to hear that. May I have your name and room number, please? [Person2]:  Yes, it's Yao Lan. Room 406. [Person1]:  And how many pieces did you have? [Person2]:  Two suitcases and a handbag. The suitcases are blue and the shoulder bag is red. [Person1]:  Is there a name tag attached to them? [Person2]:  Yes, there is. [Person1]:  We're very sorry for the delay. I'll check immediately and call you back.
[Person1]:  May I invite you to dance with me? [Person2]:  Sorry, I can't dance. [Person1]:  Never mind, I can teach you. [Person2]:  Is it difficult to learn? [Person1]:  No, it is easy. [Person2]:  How should I do? [Person1]:  You just follow me. [Person2]:  All right. By the way, do you often dance? [Person1]:  Yup, because dance can relax myself. [Person2]:  It seems a good way.
[Person1]:  Hey! How was your first day of class? I'm in level two and I'm loving my class this semester! It's great being in a class of international students! [Person2]:  Mine was ok, except that no one in my class speaks English. I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester. [Person1]:  That's both fortunate and unfortunate. It's the United Nations in my class! We have people from all over the world! There are three Germans, a Pole, a Scottish, two French, an American, a Brazilian, a Chilean, a New Zealander, though he prefers to call himself a Kiwi. Who else do we have? Oh, we also have a Moroccan, a Togolese, a Pakistani, and two Indonesians! [Person2]:  That's quite the array of nationalities. Everyone in my class is from Asia, except me. There are a few South Koreans, several Japanese, Malaysian, Thai, Singaporean, Filipino, Kazakhstan, and one Russian. [Person1]:  Well, I think you're pretty lucky actually. You'll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture. [Person2]:  I guess so, but I think it's going to be hard to relate to my classmates, especially with the language barrier. I think I might change classes. [Person1]:  Don't! Stay the course! Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful. I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice. [Person2]:  I highly doubt it. Your girlfriend is Chinese. [Person1]:  Well, there is that, yes.
[Person1]:  I have never mentioned this friend to me. Are you on very good terms with him or her? [Person2]:  We have been on good terms. She is a very nice girl. But she got in Dutch with her boss. I don't have the heart to see her pounding the pavements. [Person1]:  You must be stuck on her, or you would not use your elbow grease. [Person2]:  Well, we hit it off with each other. Nothing more, nothing much.
[Person1]:  Do you know about All Fools'Day? [Person2]:  On that day, people play all kinds of tricks on others, and the one easily taken in is called April fool. [Person1]:  April fool! [Person2]:  April the first is coming. Be careful!
[Person1]:  Good day. Welcome to IBA, what can I assist you with today? [Person2]:  Hello, yes, I'm a stock investor and I'm looking at opening a new account with you. Perhaps your new compound savings one? I already have a Current Account with you. [Person1]:  That's no trouble, Sir. [Person2]:  I'm mostly interested in the personalized services you offer, with stock market news, etc. It sounds just perfect for me, as I'm too busy to be constantly at the computer checking the performance. [Person1]:  Yes, that's just one of the services we offer in our Personal Financing Program. [Person2]:  What I need to know is how I can keep track of what's going on. I mean, some days I buy and sell quite a lot. Some days, there's no activity at all. [Person1]:  For every transaction you make, a statement will be drawn up and can be posted to you or sent via e-mail, or if you want to be double sure we can do both. [Person2]:  That's just what I need, sometimes I'm pretty forgetful.
[Person1]:  This is Officer Belford. You reported a break-in just now? [Person2]:  Yes, I did. [Person1]:  I'll need a little more information about it. [Person2]:  Just the facts. [Person1]:  What time did it happen? [Person2]:  It must have been sometime between 12 [Person1]:  What did they get? [Person2]:  Well, what I know now is some jewellery and the television. [Person1]:  OK. Good, you're making a list. By the way, did you have your belongings marked? [Person2]:  Yes. My husband put his name on the TV. [Person1]:  By the way, where is your husband? [Person2]:  He's on a trip to Canada. And I haven't told him about the robbery. [Person1]:  I see, where did you put your jewellery? [Person2]:  I put it in the refrigerator. But all my good jewellery is in the safe box in the bank. [Person1]:  OK. I'll be in touch with you as soon as we have found anything about it.
[Person1]:  Very good. Now, I have a couple of final questions. [Person2]:  I hope they're not too hard! [Person1]:  Well, why should we hire you? [Person2]:  I think that I would be a perfect fit in this company. I have a unique combination of strong technical acumen, and outstanding soft skills. you know, I excel at building strong, long-term customer relationships. For example, when I headed the customer support department in my previous company, our team solved about seventy percent of our customers'problems. I decided that we needed better information and technical preparation on our products, so after I implemented a series of training sessions in coordination with our technical department, we were able to solve ninety percent of our customers'issues. Given the opportunity, I could bring this kind of success to this company. [Person1]:  Impressive! So, what would you consider to be your greatest weakness? [Person2]:  I struggle with organization and time management. Punctuality has never been a strength of mine. I find it hard to organize my time efficiently. I have actually addressed this weakness recently, by attending a workshop on efficient time management. It helped me a lot, by providing me with great insights on how to get organized and use my time efficiently, so I think I'm getting better now. [Person1]:  Great. . . Well, let me tell you that I am very pleased with this interview. We are short-listing our candidates this week, and next week we will inform our short listed candidates of the day and time for a second interview with our CEO. [Person2]:  Great, thanks a lot! I hope to hear from you! Good bye.
[Person1]:  Hi. Can you give me a wake-up call tomorrow? [Person2]:  Certainly. What time would you like us to call you? [Person1]:  I need two wake-up calls, if you don't mind, one at 7 and the other at 7 fifteen. [Person2]:  Not a problem. We'll call you tomorrow morning at 7, and again at 7 fifteen. [Person1]:  On second thought, you'd better make that second call at 7 thirty instead of 7 fifteen. [Person2]:  Said, and done. Will there be anything else? [Person1]:  No, that gets it for now, thank you. [Person2]:  Well, give us a call if there's anything more we can help you with.
[Person1]:  Are all the children grown up now, Ruth? [Person2]:  Oh, yes. Laura is the most clever one. She's a librarian in the public library. [Person1]:  Very interesting. And what about Rita? [Person2]:  She's a secretary at the railway station. [Person1]:  And what about Rosemary? She was always a very pretty child. [Person2]:  Rosemary is a waitress in a restaurant in Paris. She's married to an engineer. [Person1]:  How about the boys, Jerry and Roland? [Person2]:  Jerry drives a bus. He drives everywhere in Europe. [Person1]:  Really? In which countries does he drive? [Person2]:  France, Austria, Greece and Russia. [Person1]:  And does Roland drive a bus, too? [Person2]:  Oh, no. Roland is a pilot. [Person1]:  Good. Where does he fly? [Person2]:  To Australia and America.
[Person1]:  What are some of the problems of doing a part-time job as a college student? [Person2]:  Schoolwork suffers. Because I don't have as much time to study as when I didn't have a part-time job. I have had to give up things I enjoy, like sleep and football. I can't get into the social life because I have to work right after class. Some of my Mends have stopped calling me. I also miss TV. [Person1]:  What do you do in a day? [Person2]:  I get up at seven to make an 8
[Person1]:  Would you like to go shopping with me on Sunday? [Person2]:  I'd like to, but I have to help my brother's English in the morning. [Person1]:  I did not mean morning or afternoon. [Person2]:  Oh. That's great. Then it is a different thing now.
[Person1]:  I see on your resume that you worked as a manager of a store called 'Computer Country'. Could you tell me a little more about your responsibilities there? [Person2]:  Sure. I was responsible for overseeing about 30 employees. I did all of the ordering for the store, and I kept track of the inventory. [Person1]:  What was the most difficult part of your job? [Person2]:  Probably handling angry customers. We didn't have them very often, but when we did, I needed to make sure they were well taken care of. After all, the customer is always right. [Person1]:  That's how we feel here too. How long did you work there? [Person2]:  I was there for three and a half years. I left the company last month. [Person1]:  And why did you leave? [Person2]:  My husband has been transferred to Boston. And I understand your company has an opening there too. [Person1]:  Yes, that's right. We do. But the position won't start until early next month. Would that be a problem for you? [Person2]:  No, not at all. My husband's new job doesn't begin for a few weeks. So we thought we would spend some time driving to Boston and stop to see my parents. [Person1]:  That sounds nice. So tell me, why are you interested in this particular position? [Person2]:  I know that your company has a great reputation, and a wonderful product. I've thought many times that I would like to be a part of it. When I heard about the opening in Boston, I jumped to the opportunity. [Person1]:  Well I'm glad you did.
[Person1]:  pardon me. Could you please pass me the tissue?  [Person2]:  sure, here you are.  [Person1]:  thanks, I didn't expect the dish to be so spicy. Are you ok?  [Person2]:  yeah, I think the food is alright, it's not too spicy though it's a little salty for me. But you are Chinese, you should have known better.  [Person1]:  well, not every Chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from Sichuan and Cuizhou provinces can. Back where I come from, people don't eat a lot of pepers and chilies.  [Person2]:  Oh, I see how this food can be really hard for you. I can sympathize with that. I stayed in Sichuan for a year. The food was difficult at the beginning. Every dish was so spicy. After a while, I got u  [Person1]:  yeah, you can increase you tolerance for spicy food, but so far, I haven't had the need or the opportunity. Every time I try spicy food, it is a total disaster for my nose and eyes.  [Person2]:  I completely understand. I didn't intend on liking spicy food at first either, but when you have no other choicess, you've got to adapt.  [Person1]:  yeah, I guess that's a typical example of when in Rome, do as the Romans do.  [Person2]:  exactly. 
[Person1]:  Hi, George. What have you been doing lately? I haven't seen you around much. Where have you been? [Person2]:  Oh, I was playing the piano for a group of Germany. I just got back. [Person1]:  It must be exciting to play the piano and travel all the time. [Person2]:  Well, playing the piano is great, but the traveling is no fun. I have just been to my manager. And he has offered me a job playing on the coast for the summer. [Person1]:  A seaside town? [Person2]:  Yes, but I don't think I'm going to take it. [Person1]:  Why not? Not enough money? [Person2]:  No, it's not bad. The money is good. About $200 a week. It's just that we will be working in the hotel, playing for the tourists and they just want the same old music over and over to dance to. And I get so bored. It's not like playing the music. It's like being a machine. [Person1]:  I wouldn't mind being a machine for that money.
[Person1]:  This is the fifth Club. May I help you? [Person2]:  Yes, I believe you have a luncheon meeting this coming Saturday. Could you give me some more information about that? [Person1]:  Yes, of course. The guest speaker is Professor Wong Lan from Beijing Foreign Language University. She'll speak about modern English. [Person2]:  I'm a student of English. That sounds interesting. And when does the meeting begin? [Person1]:  Lunch will be served at 12 [Person2]:  Is there an emission fee? [Person1]:  Yes, the luncheon lecture are 30 yuan per person. [Person2]:  And do you have any idea when it will end? [Person1]:  Oh, sorry. I'm not so sure. Maybe at about 3 [Person2]:  Very well. Thank you. [Person1]:  You are quite welcome.
[Person1]:  My grandfather hasn't been too well lately. [Person2]:  Oh, dear. I'm sorry to hear that. [Person1]:  He's 79. Don't you think he should slow down a bit at his age? [Person2]:  Absolutely. [Person1]:  But he won't listen to me. He says he wants to enjoy his life to the full. [Person2]:  Fair enough. [Person1]:  Last summer, he went on a two-week cycling holiday in France. Last winter, he attended a skiing contest. [Person2]:  You are kidding. I can't believe it. [Person1]:  We're going to give him a big party for his eightieth birthday. [Person2]:  That's great. [Person1]:  But before that, I'm going to have a word with him and tell him to take things more easy. [Person2]:  Good for you.

[Person1]:  Did you have a good vacation Katie? [Person2]:  Yeah, I took a nature adventure tour. For the first part we went hiking. It was so much fun. We hiked all the way up to these beautiful waterfalls. I took lots of pictures. [Person1]:  Sounds great, so what else did you do on the tour? [Person2]:  Well, the best part was at the end of the trip. I jumped out of an airplane. [Person1]:  Wow. [Person2]:  Yeah, it was just a fantastic vacation, but anyway, that's enough about my vacation. How did you spend your break, Ryan? [Person1]:  Oh, I drove to visit my relatives. Well, it was pretty boring actually, it rained every day, so we had to stay inside. We watched TV a lot. [Person2]:  Oh, that's too bad. [Person1]:  No, that's ok. I really had a good rest, even though it was a little boring.
[Person1]:  There is something you could help me with. [Person2]:  Please go ahead. [Person1]:  I ordered a 10,000 pairs of ladies shoes, but I received the same amount of Mens beyond expectation. [Person2]:  I'm awfully sorry, sir. I was informed just now that someone in our company has made a mistake in filling your order. I would apologize to you on behalf of our company. [Person1]:  Can you do anything about the goods mistakenly shipped? [Person2]:  We'll manage to send you the correct goods as quickly as possible. [Person1]:  How long should I wait for? [Person2]:  We will try our best to make sure that we ship the goods by the end of the month. [Person1]:  How about the wrong goods? [Person2]:  If you could sell them in your city, so much the better. [Person1]:  I'm afraid it's not an easy job, but for the sake of our friendship, I'll be glad to do that. [Person2]:  Thank you very much.
[Person1]:  Hello, this is Mike, Kara. [Person2]:  Mike! Good to hear from you. How are you? [Person1]:  Everything is fine, and how are you? [Person2]:  Things are going well with me. [Person1]:  Kara, I had fun the other night at the movies and was wondering if you would like to go out again this Friday. [Person2]:  Mike, I don't think that it's a good idea to go out again. I really need to focus on getting packed and ready to move back home. [Person1]:  Maybe we could just meet for coffee or something. [Person2]:  I can't really deal with any distractions right now, but I appreciate the nice evening we spent together.
[Person1]:  Steven, shall we go shopping tomorrow? [Person2]:  Hum... Why not go shopping the day after tomorrow? Tomorrow is Saturday. I hate all the hustle and bustle of Saturday shopping. [Person1]:  But Sunday is the same with Saturday. If you don ' t mind, that's OK. [Person2]:  Hum. Maybe it will be better. The most important thing is that I can have a day to relax after a week's work. [Person1]:  I see. We will go the day after tomorrow. [Person2]:  By the way, what kind of stores do we need to go? [Person1]:  I want to buy some clothes in clothing store. When we are going back, go to the butcher's shop and buy some chicken. [Person2]:  Let ' s also go to the jewelry store to buy a crystal necklace. I want to buy one for you as your birthday present. [Person1]:  Thank you, darling.
[Person1]:  The plumbing in my new apartment is not working. [Person2]:  I need you to tell me what the problem is. [Person1]:  The bathroom sink is stopped up. [Person2]:  Is the kitchen plumbing messed up also, or just the bathroom plumbing? [Person1]:  Just the bathroom plumbing seems to have a problem. [Person2]:  Did this just start happening, or has it been going on for a while? [Person1]:  Everything worked beautifully until a few hours ago. [Person2]:  Are you going to be home so I can come by and take a look at the problem? [Person1]:  I am not sure if I will be home later. [Person2]:  I will be coming by around 10 this morning. If you aren ' t there, I ' ll just use my key.
[Person1]:  Miguel, why haven't you finished your science homework all week? [Person2]:  I'm sorry, Ms. Perry. My house burned down last weekend. My family and I have been sleeping at my grandma's all week. I'm very stressed. I can't do my homework because my grandma's house is so loud and I lost my textbook. [Person1]:  Oh, no! Let's talk more about it during lunch. Can you come to my office then? [Person2]:  Yes, but I might be a little late. My grandma's kitchen is too small to make food, so I need to buy lunch.
[Person1]:  Good, morning! Can I help you? [Person2]:  Good morning. Could you tell me the times of trains to London, please? [Person1]:  Yes. There are trains at seven fifty-nine, nine eighteen, ten thirty-two and eleven fifty-five. [Person2]:  What time does the seven fifty-nine get to London? [Person1]:  At nine thirty-six. And the nine eighteen gets to London at nine fifty-five, the ten thirty-two at eleven nine. [Person2]:  What about coming back? I'd like to come back about 7 p. m. [Person1]:  There's one at nineteen and the next is at nineteen forty. [Person2]:  Mmm, how much is it? [Person1]:  Single or return? [Person2]:  Return, please.
[Person1]:  I was just watching a documentary on tv about people use dogs for various purpose. It was very interesting. [Person2]:  I love dogs. They have been used as guards for centuries. Nowadays, they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers. [Person1]:  The documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow. [Person2]:  Horses are useful to people too. We use them for sports and recreation. [Person1]:  Don't forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts. [Person2]:  Can you ride a horse? [Person1]:  Yes, I can. I don't ride regularly though. How about you? [Person2]:  I can ride too. Perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend? [Person1]:  What a good idea!
[Person1]:  Hello, Steven. Congratulations! [Person2]:  Thank you. [Person1]:  How's your married life? [Person2]:  We're happy together now. We both think that we're a well-matched couple. [Person1]:  That's very good. It's said that marriage is the Ab of love. But the words may not be right. [Person2]:  The situation differs in person.
[Person1]:  How do I apply to an American university? [Person2]:  You should go to the library to find some information about American universities, and write to the Admission Office. Then the Admission Office will send you application forms and other related materials. From experience, many applicants write to several universities instead of just one. [Person1]:  I was told that it took a lot of time and effort to apply. [Person2]:  That is true. I'll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities. First of all, you need official transcripts of your undergraduate work, three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence, and the official TOEFL ( Test of English as a Foreign Language ) score ( It's usually 550 ). Then you need a financial guarantee, and an application fee of 25 dollars. [Person1]:  What's to come next? [Person2]:  If they agree to enroll you, they will send you a TAP - 66 Form. With TAP - 66, you can apply for a passport from our government, and then apply for a visa from the US. Embassy in Beijing. [Person1]:  How long will it take to go over all the procedures? [Person2]:  From 3 to 6 months if everything goes well. [Person1]:  Thank you. I appreciate your help. [Person2]:  You are welcome. Please feel free to ask if you have any more questions.
[Person1]:  Welcome back racing fans! My name is Rick Fields and, as always, I am joined by my partner in crime, Bob Copeland. [Person2]:  We're in the last stretch of this very exciting race, and Kimmi Rikknen is leading the pack with only four laps to go! They are heading to turn three and Lewis Hamilton tries to pass Rikknen! It's a close one and, oh no! Hamilton hits the wall! [Person1]:  He came in too fast, jammed on the breaks and spun out. We have a yellow flag and the pace car is making its way onto the track. [Person2]:  The cleanup crew is towing the heavily damaged car and the green flag drops! Rikknen is still in the lead with only two laps to go! [Person1]:  Smoke is coming out of his car! He seems to be having engine trouble! He makes his way into the pit, and Fernando Alonso takes the lead! [Person2]:  How unlucky for Rikknen, and this race is over ladies and gentlemen, Alonso takes the checkered flag!
[Person1]:  May I see your passport please? [Person2]:  Here is my passport. And this is the declaration form. [Person1]:  What is the purpose of your visit to the United States? [Person2]:  Business. I have a trade convention I'm attending in Chicago. [Person1]:  This visa is good for two weeks. Do you intend to stay longer than that? [Person2]:  No. I will fly back twelve days from now. [Person1]:  And you will do some traveling while you are here? [Person2]:  Yes, I want to spend a couple days in New York. I have friends there I will visit. [Person1]:  What do you have in the bag, Mr. Lee? [Person2]:  Just my cameras, my clothes, and some books. [Person1]:  You're not carrying any food with you today? [Person2]:  No. [Person1]:  Okay, Mr. Lee. This is just a routine check. Would you mind opening the bag for me? [Person2]:  Alright.
[Person1]:  May I help you, sir? [Person2]:  Yes, I want to buy a VCR. [Person1]:  Well, we have many models to choose from here. Do you have a particular brand you want? [Person2]:  No. I only want it to be a very good one. The best. It's a graduation gift for my son. [Person1]:  I see. And does your son have a VCR now? [Person2]:  Well, he uses our VCR at home. But he's going to university in the Fall, so he needs his own VCR. [Person1]:  Does he watch a lot of movies? [Person2]:  Yes, he sure does. In fact, he wants to become a movie producer himself. He wants to study film at the university. [Person1]:  I would like to make a suggestion then, sir. [Person2]:  Please do. [Person1]:  If your son wants to study film, probably he will start to collect movies himself. [Person2]:  Yes, I know that. So I want him to have a good VCR to use. [Person1]:  May I suggest you consider buying him a DVD player instead? [Person2]:  DVD? Isn't that like a CD? [Person1]:  It is very similar. The technology is the same. [Person2]:  Why is a DVD better than a VCR? [Person1]:  For one thing, sir, the quality of the image is usually better. That's because it's digital. [Person2]:  But isn't it more expensive? [Person1]:  It is a little more expensive, sir. But there is one important advantage which your son might appreciate. [Person2]:  What's that? [Person1]:  If your son starts to buy video tapes, he can't keep them very long. [Person2]:  And why not? [Person1]:  Video tape breaks down after fifteen years. So if he collects a lot of tapes, after fifteen years they will all start to rot. [Person2]:  Hmm. Is that true? [Person1]:  Yes, it is, sir. [Person2]:  Well. And what about DVDs? [Person1]:  This is the excellent thing about DVDs. If your son starts to collect DVDs, they will last forever. They will never rot. [Person2]:  Hmm. He might really appreciate that. I know he will start to collect movies at school. Especially if he studies film. [Person1]:  So let me show you some of our DVD players. In my opinion, DVD is the wave of the future. [Person2]:  Alright, please show me what you have.
[Person1]:  The channel boats are quite fast, aren't they? [Person2]:  Yes, very. They make the trip in about an hour. [Person1]:  I hope we shan't have a rough passage. [Person2]:  No, I hope not. I want to have a deck chair and enjoy the crossing. [Person1]:  That's a good idea. [Person2]:  The sea seems quite calm, so there will be no fear of seasickness. Are you seasick? [Person1]:  Yes, unfortunately. I'm very much subject to it. [Person2]:  I'm not a very good sailor, either. My mother is a dreadfully poor sailor. In fact, she never takes a voyage unless she has to. I am better than that, and even on the Pacific. after ten days of it, I can still find my sea legs. Well, happily we shall have a smooth passage today. [Person1]:  Yes, this little boat gets up a fine speed, and I think we'll soon get to the land. [Person2]:  Yeah, I am of the same opinion.
[Person1]:  Good evening, Madam. Could you do me a favor? [Person2]:  Of course. What can I do for you? [Person1]:  I am looking for a hotel. Are there any hotels near here? [Person2]:  Yes, there are some in this street. The nearest one is next to the bank. It's quite modern. [Person1]:  You see. I'm leaving tomorrow morning. Do you think there're any hotels not too expensive? [Person2]:  Yes. Drive on for five minutes and you'll find a yellow building on your left. It's a family-style hotel, very comfortable, and the price is quite reasonable. [Person1]:  It sounds nice. Thank you very much for your help. [Person2]:  You are welcome.
[Person1]:  I've bought so many things, beautiful dresses, nice shoes and so much food. But I can't carry them alone to my place. [Person2]:  You can ask the assistants for some bags. They will help you carry the things easily.
[Person1]:  Hey, Jenny, let's go to a movie. You've been working on these bills for hours now. [Person2]:  It's impossible. [Person1]:  Why? [Person2]:  We can't afford to go out. Look at the bills yourself. Everything I say goes in one ear and out of the other. [Person1]:  All right. I've been trying to cut down our expenses lately. I've been turning off the lights when I leave the room.
[Person1]:  Can I help you? [Person2]:  Yes, I am looking for a pair of gloves. I think I wear size six. [Person1]:  The gloves are on this counter. Let's see... How about the blue pair? The color suits you and they are washable, too. [Person2]:  Oh, I'll try them on. They seem to fit. How much shall I pay you? [Person1]:  They are on sales this week. They have been reduced to twenty-five dollars. [Person2]:  All right. I will take them. [Person1]:  They are very nice. [Person2]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  Can I help you? [Person2]:  Yes, I'd like to read some articles that are on reserve about British culture. [Person1]:  Professor Grand's class? [Person2]:  That's right. How could you know? [Person1]:  Let's just say you are not the first person coming in asking for those articles. [Person2]:  Oh, well, seeing as how I haven't read any of them yet, it doesn't really matterwhich one you give me first. [Person1]:  I'm afraid I can't give you any of them at the moment. They've all been checked out. [Person2]:  You're joking, all of them? [Person1]:  Every month. I've asked professor Grand twice already to bring in additional copies of the articles, but no sooner do I place them on the shelves than they are gone. See that girl in the black sweater? She's been waiting for half an hour for those same articles to be returned. [Person2]:  And here's me. I went out of my way to free out the whole afternoon to read. [Person1]:  I'm sorry, but there is not a whole lot I can do about it. All I can suggest is that you come in first thing tomorrow morning and try again. We open at eight.
[Person1]:  There are many interesting stories about how a baby learns to say its first word. Now, Mark, would you like to share your story with us? [Person2]:  OK. Here's my story. I was about 18 months old, I think, and I had just started saying my first word. Every time a truck went by, I would shout a word that sounded like truck, but to everyone else, it sounded nothing like it. My parents tried to correct me, but failed. Then about 3 months later we traveled to New York as we were waiting for our plane at the airport. I looked out of a huge window. At that very moment, I saw the largest truck in the world. I had to tell someone about this. I turned my father, who was standing next to about 1000 people waiting for various flights and screamed truck, truck. My father tried hard to shut me up, but I was so excited. I kept screaming my special word. My poor mother decided she didn't know this baby and ran into the ladies room where she hid until I finally stopped. Well, I learn how to say truck correctly and soon I was talking like a normal child. However, my parents will never forget the very first word I produced in my life.
[Person1]:  Good morning! What can I do for you? [Person2]:  I'm thinking of travelling to Suzhou in July. Could you recommend some tourist programs for that? [Person1]:  With pleasure. We arrange two kinds of tourist programs for Suzhou, a six-day tour by train and a five-day flying journey. [Person2]:  How much does a six-day tour by train cost? [Person1]:  Five hundred yuan. [Person2]:  Does that include hotels and meals? [Person1]:  Oh, yes, and admission tickets for places of interest as well. [Person2]:  That sounds reasonable. What about the five-day flying journey? How much is that? [Person1]:  Eight hundred and fifty yuan. [Person2]:  Covering all expenses? [Person1]:  Yes. But there is no half fare for children. They must pay full fare.
[Person1]:  I really think if I can get my foot in the door at this company it will do wonders for my career. Do you think you can help me polish my interview style? [Person2]:  Sure. Doing your homework and preparing for an interview really pays off. [Person1]:  I ' Ve researched the company and think I ' m perfect for the job but I ' m not sure how to get it across to them. [Person2]:  Well first you have to have more confidence.Employers look for people who are interested, enthusiastic and sure of themselves. [Person1]:  I know I have what it takes but Im worried that my work experience won ' t sufficient. Should I inflate my experience? [Person2]:  No, you should always be upfront and honest about your weaknesses. However by focusing on your strong points and maintaining a positive attitude about your abilities, you can take the attention

[Person1]:  It really does, I can't wait. [Person2]:  What time does the party start? [Person1]:  It starts at 8 o'clock. [Person2]:  Oh, well, how many people has she given invites to so far?

[Person1]:  Can I borrow your Cds for our school dance? [Person2]:  Oh, you don't ask much, do you? [Person1]:  I promise I will personally guard every single one and they will come back in perfect condition. [Person2]:  I'll tell you what. Your class can rent them from me for the night and buy back any damaged ones. [Person1]:  That sounds fair. That's still cheaper than paying a band to come play for us. [Person2]:  Not as fun though. A live band is way more exciting! [Person1]:  Our class doesn't have enough money. We already checked into it. [Person2]:  Let me know with your next dance. I know a band that may give you a break for the publicity.
[Person1]:  Quite a few people are laid off these days. [Person2]:  Yeah. It is not easy for them to find another job. [Person1]:  University graduates have difficulty finding a job too. There seems to be more and more competition in the job market [Person2]:  It is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one. What do you think? Do you want to quit your job? [Person1]:  No. Not now. I think I'll try to keep this one.
[Person1]:  What do you think of smoking? [Person2]:  It's harmful not only for yourself but for others. [Person1]:  What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking? [Person2]:  Stop producing cigarettes. [Person1]:  But that'll affect the national economy. [Person2]:  That's right. But I don't think there are better ways. [Person1]:  How about painting a warning on each cigarette packet? [Person2]:  Maybe it can take effect.

[Person2]:  Public schools are usually state funded, whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere. [Person1]:  Which is better? [Person2]:  One isn't necessarily better than the other. It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers. [Person1]:  I hear you have to wear uniforms at private school. [Person2]:  Yes, sometimes.
[Person1]:  What color should we paint this room, honey? [Person2]:  How about red? [Person1]:  Red in the dining room? No way. [Person2]:  Why not? I think red is a great color for a wall. [Person1]:  But red makes you fat. [Person2]:  What are you talking about? [Person1]:  I was reading a magazine article that said warm colors make you want to eat more, blue would be better. [Person2]:  But I like eating. Let's paint the room red. [Person1]:  Not a chance.
[Person1]:  Welcome back, soccer fans. My name is Rick Fields and, as always, I am joined by my commentating wingman, Bob Copeland. [Person2]:  And we're on the brink of soccer history today, as Ecuador and Brazil are tied one-one as we begin the second half of the 2022 World Cup! [Person1]:  The ref calls the players for the kick off, and here we go! Ecuador quickly passes the ball to the midfield, but, oath, it's out of bounds. [Person2]:  That will be a throw in for Brazil. Adriano has the ball and makes a long pass to Robin, and the ref has called him offside. [Person1]:  No question about it. He was offside by a mile! We have a goal kick for Ecuador. Edison Mendez heads it to Valencia, he shoots! Deflected by the defender and we have a corner kick. [Person2]:  Delgado takes the corner. We have a foul! Oh no, Did, the goalkeeper, has fouled the Ecuadorian player! He gets a yellow card and that will be a penalty kick! [Person1]:  This is the perfect opportunity for Ecuador to get ahead in this match and become World Champions! He gets ready for the kick. He shoots! and he. . .

The girl Jennifer, who is sharing her apartment has moved out, so she has a free room now. [Person2]:  That's great, your sister is such a good girl. Everyone likes her. I'll call her and move as soon as possible. After all, I need to sleep well at night, in order to do well in the coming exam.

Did the whole project just vanish into thin air? [Person2]:  No, sir. The plant expansion project has been delayed. There was a snag up in the fling process to get the necessary construction permits. It seems that the property we were slated to build on is also habitat for some endangered indigenous species. [Person1]:  You're joking, right? No wonder we've been tied up with this project. I know the environmental impact statement will take forever to get approval if they've found anything endangered on the site.

We're supposed to be able to do our preparation and marking in that office, but have you noticed? Jack constantly has students coming in to get help with his course. A lot people are going in and out. [Person2]:  Has anybody spoken to him about it? [Person1]:  No, not yet, but someone's going to have to. [Person2]:  We can't really ask him to stop having students come in for help, can we? [Person1]:  No, of course not. But I'm not able to do my work and neither are you. [Person2]:  How about recommending him to use the storage room down the hall? [Person1]:  Oh, that would be too small. [Person2]:  With the cabinets taken out, it might be bigger than it looks. [Person1]:  Come to think of it, you may be on to something. Let's go have a look. [Person2]:  Let's rock n'roll.

I am saying it from the bottom of my heart! And it's obvious that he's head over heels in love with you, too.  [Person2]:  I sure hope so.

[Person1]:  Do you want to go out of the state or stay here? [Person2]:  I want to stay in the state, so I will be close to home. [Person1]:  It sure would be nice to be close enough to come home on weekends when you want to. How about a public or private university? [Person2]:  Well, I like the atmosphere of a private school. The students are more serious about school and there aren't a lot of parties. [Person1]:  Yes, but private universities are so expensive. How are you going to pay for it? [Person2]:  I've applied for a music scholarship, and my parents will be able to help me pay for some of the expenses. What about you? What are you going to do after graduation? [Person1]:  I'm going to study in Oregon State University. [Person2]:  Oh, I know a lot of kids who've gone there really like it. [Person1]:  Well, a lot of my friends are going there. And the school has a good teacher preparation program. I've always wanted to be a teacher. I'm really excited about the life at college. [Person2]:  Well, good luck. [Person1]:  You, too. See you later.
[Person1]:  How do you want your hair cut? [Person2]:  I want it the way Peckham wears it. [Person1]:  Who is Peckham? [Person2]:  Are you kidding me? Even the girls know Peckham. Whatever, I have a picture of him here. [Person1]:  You are a big fan of him! He has strong legs. [Person2]:  Sure, he is a soccer star. [Person1]:  Hey, wake up. It's done. How do you like it? [Person2]:  Oh, my God. It's disaster. It makes my head look like a soccer ball. [Person1]:  But it's the same hairstyle. [Person2]:  It looks like the hairstyle of Kahn who stands beside him in the picture. [Person1]:  Oh. I made a mistake. I thought the guy on the right was Peckham. [Person2]:  He plays outside right but it doesn't mean he has to stand on the right. [Person1]:  Sorry, but do not worry. I think I can fix it. Just cut a little more off the temple. [Person2]:  Do it, please.
[Person1]:  You're a wonderful person, Kathleen. [Person2]:  So are you. [Person1]:  And I'm so honored that you would want to be with me because you would never be with anyone who wasn't truly worthy. [Person2]:  I feel exactly the same way as you. [Person1]:  Don't, don't, don't, don't say that. That, that makes it worse. [Person2]:  What? You don't love me? Me, either. [Person1]:  You don't love me? [Person2]:  No. [Person1]:  But we're so right for each other. [Person2]:  I know, I know. Well, is there some, is there someone else? Oh, that woman on television, Sydney Ann.
[Person1]:  I don't know how John can put up with his son, who fools around without working. [Person2]:  He's out of John's hands. Nothing he can do about such a black sheep. [Person1]:  If I were him, I would give him a good talking-to. I would insist on his stopping fooling around like that.
[Person1]:  I had a terrible journey back from Bangkok last week. [Person2]:  Really? Why? What happened? [Person1]:  Well, first of all, the taxi that was taking me from the client's office to the airport broke down on the freeway. [Person2]:  Oh, no. [Person1]:  Yes, and the driver didn't speak any English or Chinese and he didn't have a phone on him-can you believe it? - and his radio didn't work. So there was no way he could get in touch with the office to get them to send another taxi. [Person2]:  So what did you do? [Person1]:  Well, I actually thumbed a lift. [Person2]:  You what? [Person1]:  Yes, I stood on the side of the freeway and stuck my thumb out, and a passing truck stopped and took me to the airport. [Person2]:  Wow, good for you. [Person1]:  Yes, except he drove really slowly, and I missed my flight. [Person2]:  Oh, no! [Person1]:  Yes, so I had to wait three hours for the next one. I didn't get home till four in the morning, and when I got home I realized I'd left my house keys in my hotel in Bangkok. [Person2]:  You really have bad luck, don't you? [Person1]:  Seems like it.

[Person1]:  He is doing OK, but he pretends he is doing much better by telling lies. [Person2]:  What's his problem? [Person1]:  This may be complicated.

[Person1]:  Mmm, you do realize Mr. Kumar that to bring a hand gun into Hong Kong without proper authorization is a serious offense. [Person2]:  But I didn't bring it. I ... I mean I didn't know anything about it. It wasn't there when I left Delhi. My bags were searched. It was part of the airport security check. [Person1]:  Maybe so, but someone managed to get that hand gun onto the aircraft or it couldn't have been there. [Person2]:  Someone but not me. [Person1]:  Tell me, where was your personal bag during the flight? [Person2]:  I had it down by my feet between me and the man in the next seat. He was the only person who could have opened my bag while I was asleep. It must have been him. [Person1]:  I see. Have you any idea who this man was? [Person2]:  He told me his name, Alfred Foster. He was very friendly, after I woke up that is. He hadn't spoken before. [Person1]:  Alfred Foster, we can check that on the passenger list. [Person2]:  He said he had a car coming to meet him. He offered me a lift. [Person1]:  Oh, Why should he do that? [Person2]:  So he can get his handgun back, that's why. Please find him, Madam.
[Person1]:  Excuse me. Do you have any keys or money in your pockets? [Person2]:  No. No. I think I've taken everything out. [Person1]:  Okay. Go ahead and walk through the body scanner. [Person2]:  Will I feel anything? [Person1]:  No sir. Just walk through and keep your hands in the air. [Person2]:  Okay, huh? [ Security alarm goes off ... ] [Person1]:  We need to do some additional screening. Sorry, sir. Please come this way. [What? Did I ... Did you find something?] Relax sir. Okay? I'm going to open your carry-on bag. As I'm going through it, please do not try to touch it. [Okay.] Let's see now. Hmmm. First of all, sir, you can't take any liquids like this bottled water past this point. [Person2]:  Ah. Well, I really can't drink any other kind of water. Sierra Springs is the only bottled water I drink. [Person1]:  Sorry sir. [Ah ... ] And, sir. What's this? [What?] No, sir, you cannot bring a lighter on the plane. [Person2]:  But I don't smoke. I mean ... [You STILL can't bring it on the plane.] But I have it just in case of emergencies. You know, as an emergency fire starter in case the plane crashes into a dark forest. [Person1]:  Sir. You'll have to leave that here. What's this? [Person2]:  Well ...Oh. That's my pocket knife. [Person1]:  A pocket knife? It's almost a foot long! [Person2]:  Well, it's a special knife given to me by my grandfather, but I only use it to peel apples and fruit. You know ... Things like that. [Person1]:  Sir. I'm sorry, but you can't take that on the plane. In fact, do you have any other prohibited items in your bag? [Well, I don't ...] I mean, didn't you read the sign back there explaining all of the items that were not allowed on board? [Person2]:  Well, I started to read it, and I then got a little distracted. [Person1]:  A little? Sir. How many times have you flown on an airplane? [Person2]:  Uh, it has been a while. I think the last time I traveled by plane was about, uh, 1960 ... [Person1]:  Sir. Why don't you come with me? [WHAT?] I think my supervisor would like to ask you a few questions. [Person2]:  Oh, no!
[Person1]:  You're not looking too good. Are you sure you are all right? [Person2]:  It was a long flight. I'll be fine after a good night's sleep. [Person1]:  You look very pale. [Person2]:  These long flights are just so boring, and you just have to sit there in your seat without moving and you know I like to get as much exercise as possible. I'm sure I'll be back to normal tomorrow.
[Person1]:  Hi Bob, how's business? [Person2]:  Just okay. [Person1]:  Okay, enough small talk. Let's get down to business. [Person2]:  Good idea. [Person1]:  Since we're good friends, you don't have to pay me. [Person2]:  No, I can't accept it. Business is business.
[Person1]:  Hi, can I help you?  [Person2]:  No, thanks. I'm just looking.  [Person1]:  All right. If you need any help, just let me know. My name is Greg.  [Person2]:  Sure, I'll let you know if I need anything. Hm, this mattress is very firm. Jack will probably like it.  [Person1]:  Did you find something you like?  [Person2]:  Yes, this mattress is very good. It's pretty firm. The mattress I'm now sleeping on is saggy.  [Person1]:  You are right. This is very good brand. It doesn't sag easily and we offer a lifetime warranty, so you don't have to worry about its quality.  [Person2]:  Does it come with a frame?  [Person1]:  Unfortunately, it doesn't. However we can give you a 10% discount on the frame. We also offer a very good financing plan. There is no payment no interest until next June.  [Person2]:  That's an attractive plan. I'll think about it. 
[Person1]:  So, Jack, do you believe in ghosts?  [Person2]:  No, not really. Why do you ask?  [Person1]:  Because I want to tell you about the time that I saw a ghost.  [Person2]:  You saw a ghost? When?  [Person1]:  It was many years ago, when I was a little child. It was the middle of the night, and I went to get a drink of water from the kitchen. I walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs, when...  [Person2]:  So that's where you saw the ghost? In your house? What did it look like? Was it hideous?  [Person1]:  It was a big, green thing that looked like a person. It was in the kitchen, and it slowly moved towards the stairs...  [Person2]:  So what did you do?  [Person1]:  I hid so that it couldn't see me. Slowly it got closer and closer, until ... ...  [Person2]:  Until what? What happened? Did you see it clearly? Did it attack you?  [Person1]:  It moved slowly up the stairs, step by step, and I could hear its approaching footsteps. When it finally got to the top of the stairs, I realized that it was my father in his green pajamas. He had gone to get a late night snack. 
[Person1]:  Adam, I called your home this morning but I couldn't get through. Was there anything wrong with your phone? [Person2]:  I was at an art exhibition. I had it turned off before I entered the exhibition hall. [Person1]:  What did you see at the exhibition? [Person2]:  It was about ancient Greek art. You know, I love such exhibitions. Do you love going to exhibitions? [Person1]:  Certainly, but I prefer those about famous people. What else do you like doing besides going to exhibitions? Do you often go to concerts? [Person2]:  No, though I love music, I can't afford to go to concerts. What about you? [Person1]:  I love going to pop concerts. I went to Tylor Swift concert earlier this month. [Person2]:  How did you like it? [Person1]:  It couldn't be better. I have never been let down by her live performances.
[Person1]:  Hi, Li Ming. You look upset. What's the matter? [Person2]:  There will be a parents'meeting in our class this Saturday and I am worried about it. [Person1]:  Why? We can leave school earlier that day. [Person2]:  I didn't do well in last exams. If my father knows it, he will beat me up. [Person1]:  I can't believe it. My parents never beat me. [Person2]:  You know that my father is irritable. [Person1]:  You can ask the teacher for help. [Person2]:  Good idea.
[Person1]:  What's up? You don't look too good. [Person2]:  Yeah, my head hurts, that's all. I'Ve been in physics class all day. It's killer! [Person1]:  I liked physics. It's all math, really, arcs, curves, velocity, cool stuff. [Person2]:  Yeah, yeah, but today's lesson was all about the creation of the universe. [Person1]:  A physics class about the creation of the universe? That's some pretty unscientific language there. Sounds more religious to me. [Person2]:  It's all religion. Take the theory of the Big Bang. How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion? That's no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff. [Person1]:  Turtles? Whatever. . . Look, all that's required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles. At least, that's what the math says. [Person2]:  Math, sheath. What's the evidence? [Person1]:  There is evidence! You know Edwin Hubble? He's the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe, thus advancing notions of an expanding universe. What would it be expanding from? Well, the Big Bang. . . DUH! [Person2]:  Anyway, it's just a theory. Why do people go around touting theories? Where's the scientific rigor in that? [Person1]:  Dude, don't equivocate. A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing. You slept through class, didn't you?
[Person1]:  What's ' pi '? [Person2]:  That's the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, I think. [Person1]:  I see. What is that ratio exactly? [Person2]:  It's approximately 3. 14, but the number continues forever. What's the diameter of your circle? [Person1]:  It's 10 centimeters, so the circumference should be 31. 4 centimeters. [Person2]:  Ok. My next problem is to convert 10000 british pounds into us dollars. What's the exchange rate at the moment? [Person1]:  According to the newspaper, the exchange rate is 1. 85 dollars to the pound. [Person2]:  That means that 10. 000 pounds will buy me 18. 500 dollars. [Person1]:  What's the next question. [Person2]:  Fractions. What's a quarter and an eighth? That's three-eights. Easy. The next question is ' what are prime numbers? '. [Person1]:  I can help you there. Those are numbers that cannot be created by multiplying two whole numbers, apart from the number itself and 1, together. [Person2]:  So, 1, 2 and 3 are prime numbers, but 4 isn't because 2 * 2 = 4. [Person1]:  Exactly. Anything else? [Person2]:  How many seconds in an hour? 60 seconds multiplied by 60 minutes equals 3600 seconds altogether. [Person1]:  You'll be a mathematician one day.
[Person1]:  We're lucky today. [Person2]:  Yes, there aren't any clouds in the sky and we've got such a beautiful view here. Look! This is St James Park. And there's Buckingham Palace [Person1]:  Where's Hyde Park? [Person2]:  It's on the other side of the Palace. [Person1]:  That's the place where people make speeches on Sundays, isn't it? [Person2]:  Yes, you're right. Politicians of all kinds, religious people, and one or two madmen. [Person1]:  Well, are we going there today? I want to take shots there. [Person2]:  Sure. I can see you're enjoying your trip today. [Person1]:  Of course. Everything's so striking and fascinating.
[Person1]:  Henry, I want to ask you something. [Person2]:  Say what you want to say. [Person1]:  You see. The wage is not paid yet, I am wondering if you could possibly lend me some money. [Person2]:  I am sorry. But I do not have any money to lend to you.
[Person1]:  What kind of document is an invoice? [Person2]:  It's a document from the seller to the buyer. It contains full particulars of the goods sold, such as quantity, quality, price, forwarding particulars, and terms of payment. [Person1]:  How many kinds of foreign invoices are there? [Person2]:  Four. They are Loco invoice, FOB invoice, CIF invoice and Franco invoice. [Person1]:  What does the price in different kinds of invoices include? [Person2]:  By Loco invoice, the price includes only the cost of goods at the warehouse of the seller. By FOB invoice, the price includes the cost before the cargo is delivered. By CIF invoice, the price includes all the expenses of cost freight and insurance. The price in Franco invoice includes all expenses to destination. [Person1]:  Oh, I see.
[Person1]:  I'll try one of these on. ( The customer tries one of the shoes on. ) It's too big. It slides up and down my heel when I walk around. [Person2]:  Well, let's try a size ten. ( He gets another pair and the customer tries a shoe on ) Looks like a perfect fit. [Person1]:  Not really. It pinches my toes. [Person2]:  I'm sure they'll be fine once you break them in. [Person1]:  I don't know. . . well, I guess I'll take them, since you don't seem to have anything better. [Person2]:  Thank you, ma'am. It's been a pleasure doing business with you.
[Person1]:  Hi, Mary, can I have a minute? [Person2]:  Sure, what's up? [Person1]:  Well, actually I want to tell you that I've put in notice. [Person2]:  Really? Why? [Person1]:  Many reasons. I've been here for too long. Next year will be my five-year anniversary. I want a change of setting. Besides, our company is downsizing. I don't want to stay on just to be let go. [Person2]:  But they wouldn't lay you off! You are the most experienced project manager in the company. [Person1]:  Maybe. But that's not kept the new boss from breathing down my neck. To be honest, I've got a better offer from another company. [Person2]:  Oh that's great, congratulations! What's your new position? [Person1]:  Senior director of market research. In addition to a nice pay rise it has some nice perks, like a company car, one month paid vacation, and an apartment downtown. And it's an international company so I'll have lots of chances to travel and meet new people. I'm really looking forward to it. [Person2]:  Sounds a great opportunity. I bet that made the decision to leave a lot easier. [Person1]:  Indeed. But let's stay in touch. I'll let you know how things go. [Person2]:  Sure.
[Person1]:  Please point out the painful place with your finger. Is there any relation between the pain and the weather? [Person2]:  Yes, the pain comes more intense when the weather is bad. And the pain comes more intense when I walk too much. [Person1]:  Have you ever had any trauma? [Person2]:  Yes, I have. [Person1]:  Does the pian become more intense at night? [Person2]:  Yes, it does. Just like a needle prick. Besides, the place that hurts often feels cold, too. [Person1]:  Do you have the sensation of ants crawling over the painful part? [Person2]:  Yes, I do. [Person1]:  I'd like to treat you with acupuncture if you agree. [Person2]:  By the way, does acupuncture hurt? [Person1]:  Acupuncture may cause just a little pain, but it also causes a certain feeling of numbness and distension. We'll try it every day for seven days. Will that be all right? [Person2]:  Yes. Let's start today.
[Person1]:  Welcome back! I didn't see you in the history class on Friday. [Person2]:  I wasn't here on Friday. My geography class went to a field trip to look at some of the different rocks. In fact, we slept there last night. [Person1]:  Really? That sounds excellent! Where did you go? [Person2]:  A desert. It gets hot during the day, but it cools off very quickly at night. It is very dry there after the sun goes down. [Person1]:  Well, did you enjoy the trip? [Person2]:  Of course I did. The desert is nicer than you might think. Since there are so few plants growing there, it's very easy to see different rocks. And the natural colors of the rocks shine in the sun. You really should go there to have a look. [Person1]:  I really want to go there. You must call me if you have the chance to go there again. [Person2]:  No problem. I will be your guide next time.
[Person1]:  Well, Mr. Smith, we have had an interesting discussion about your work. Now, tell us something about your after-work activities. [Person2]:  I guess not much different from everyone else. I'm interested in sport, and I run about 3 miles every day. I particularly enjoy cross-country running, where you have to run across fields, jump over streams and so on. While I'm running I think about all sorts of things, and at the end of a run I'm sometimes surprised to find that I've managed to solve a problem that was on my mind. Next year I'm going to try the London Marathon. It's a long, hard race - 26 miles, or 42 kilometres - and you have to be tough to finish, but I very much want to do it. I worry a bit about getting old and I'd like to prove to myself that I'm still almost as fit as I was twenty years ago. I'm interested in climbing as well as running. I'll never become an expert climber, but I know what I'm doing in the mountains. I successfully completed a course in snow and ice climbing when I was younger, and I've done a series of easy climbs in the Alps during the last few years. My wife doesn't share my interest in mountains. She agreed to go climbing with me once, but she found that she felt ill as soon as she got above 1000 metres, so we decide to follow different hobbies. [Person1]:  You certainly seem to enjoy various types of recreation. All right, Mr. Smith. Thanks for your interesting talk.
[Person1]:  Are you ready to order?  [Person2]:  I think that we have a pretty good idea of what we would like to order.  [Person1]:  Let me tell you about the specials of the day, which are chicken in a wine sauce with capers, and grilled garlic shrimp.  [Person2]:  I was wondering if the chef could leave off the sauce.  [Person1]:  The chef would be happy to accommodate your special requests.  [Person2]:  I am a vegetarian. Do you have any vegetarian selections?  [Person1]:  You could choose the roasted vegetable and garlic pizza or the goat cheese and candied walnut salad.  [Person2]:  I think that we will split the roasted vegetable and garlic pizza.  [Person1]:  That is a good selection, and I can bring your salads now or serve them with your entree.  [Person2]:  You can bring us our salads when you bring us our entree. 
[Person1]:  Hi, can I help you? [Person2]:  I hope so. My name is Mark. I'm... [Person1]:  Don't I remember you from last year? You worked in, uh, where was it? The art library? [Person2]:  You have a good memory. Yeah, that was me, and I really enjoyed the work. But for this year. [Person1]:  Well, if you come in earlier. You could probably have gotten the library job again, but now... [Person2]:  I plan to get a job in a restaurant this year. I really need it to make more money and working as a waiter. There always the tips. But I've tried a ton of places and I haven't found anything, and then my friend Susan. She takes photography classes in Harrison Hall. And she sort of thought there might be an opening there. [Person1]:  Let's see, ha, your friends right, seems like one of the students quit a couple of weeks ago for some reason. Well, whatever, it looks like this is your lucky day. [Person2]:  Wow, that is so great. So who is the contact person? [Person1]:  Jack with the student office.
[Person1]:  Hi, excuse me sir? I'm looking for a dress shoe. My usual pair that I'Ve had for years have finally been stretched out of shape. They don't provide any support anymore. [Person2]:  Sure, what kind of shoe are you looking for? We'Ve got strappy sandals, sleek high heels, edgy pumps, or if you're looking for something a little more practical, we'Ve got Mary Janes, ballerinas. [Person1]:  Show me some classic high heels, please. [Person2]:  Ok, right this way. What color did you have in mind? [Person1]:  Black. Classic. [Person2]:  Of course. We'Ve got this style here that is very popular. Because it's an open-toe shoe, you can wear it any time of the year. They look great on everyone. [Person1]:  Umm. too shiny. And I wear pantyhose with my shoes so let's look for a closed-toe shoe. [Person2]:  OK, these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a two-inch heel so they are very comfortable. [Person1]:  I don't like the pointed toes. Let me take a look at what else you have. Too high. That one looks like the back would cut into my heel. I have a high instep so I doubt that one will fit properly. [Person2]:  What size? [Person1]:  Seven-and-a-half. [Person2]:  Here we are. How does it fit? [Person1]:  Hmmm. Not good. They're too tight. The length is right, but the shoe is too narrow and it's pinching my toes. And there'd be no room for my insoles. You know what? I don't think I have the patience for keeping trying on those shoes. I will look for them at other stores. [Person2]:  Have a nice day, Ma'am.
[Person1]:  What is your long term career plan you set for yourself? [Person2]:  First of all, I hope to spend a few years working in some famous companies to command a skill, to set a solid foundation and to build my interpersonal network. When I feel I have accumulated enough experience, I hope to own an undertaking. Of course this is up to the situation then and the opportunities the companies offer me. In the long run, I hope to be an entrepreneur.
[Person1]:  I can bet the farm that you will regret about your decision. You cannot find a better one. [Person2]:  How can you be so sure? You haven't been together with her, have you? [Person1]:  No. But I'm sure she is a good girl. My sixth sense tells me so. [Person2]:  Then try it yourself.
[Person1]:  I'm sorry, dad. But you can't do that. It's for me to decide. [Person2]:  Oh, I see. You'Ve already decided, have you? Now, you listen to me, you're only 19. [Person1]:  I didn't say I'd already decided, dad. I said it was for me to decide. There is a difference. [Person2]:  Oh. So you think you can just do whatever you want, do you? [Person1]:  I didn't say that either. I was hoping we could discuss the matter together. I want your advice but I don't want you to tell me what to do. I'Ve got to make decisions for myself, dad.
[Person1]:  How time flies! Why I always feel haven't enough time to work and study? [Person2]:  Yes, I also felt that. I'm always busy, and have no time for rest. I don't know how to make use of time. [Person1]:  Maybe we should make a plan and list what we should do next, and follow it. [Person2]:  That's a good idea. And in this way we will know how we spend our time and spare a lot of time to do other things. [Person1]:  You are right. Let's stop idling around and do something. [Person2]:  Yeah, time is money. We really need to make good use of it.
[Person1]:  How can you keep in touch with your aunt in America? [Person2]:  Oh, I make a phone call once a month. [Person1]:  It's very expensive, right? [Person2]:  Yeah. [Person1]:  Why not send E-mail through the Internet? [Person2]:  Is it convenient and cheap? [Person1]:  Sure. You can send E-mail to each other every day through the internet. In addition, you can make a phone call through the internet, too. [Person2]:  Really? I'm so glad to hear that. But I don't know how to get access to the Internet. Could you show me? [Person1]:  No problem. I'll tell you. [Person2]:  I'll appreciate it very much.
[Person1]:  And how will you be paying for your room, Ms. White? [Person2]:  By credit card. [Person1]:  Both rooms on the same card? [Person2]:  Yes. [Person1]:  Your card number please? [Person2]:  4434 1234 5678 9902. [Person1]:  Double one, zero two? [Person2]:  No, double nine zero two. [Person1]:  4434 1234 5678 9902? [Person2]:  That's right. [Person1]:  And the expiry date? [Person2]:  Eleven, . . . [Person1]:  Could you repeat that please? [Person2]:  November this year. [Person1]:  Thank you. I've booked two rooms for Ms. White and Mr. Webber from Wednesday the 25th to Saturday the 28th of September. [Person2]:  Thank you. [Person1]:  You're welcome. We'll see you on the 25th, Ms. White. [Person2]:  Thanks a lot. Goodbye. [Person1]:  Goodbye.
[Person1]:  Which kinds of meat are most popular in your country? [Person2]:  We eat a lot of chicken, pork and beef. You eat those meat a lot in your country too, don't you? [Person1]:  Yes, we do. We also eat a lot of lamb. [Person2]:  yes. I'Ve heard that people in your country like to eat lamb chops. [Person1]:  That's right. They tastes so good! We eat them with mint sauce. Have you every tried them? [Person2]:  Yes, I have. I tried them when I visited your country last year. I thought they were very tasty. Can you cook them? [Person1]:  I certainly can. If I can get some from the butcher's, I'll cook them for you. [Person2]:  That sounds great. I'll bring a bottle of wine.
[Person1]:  I feel like to wear my hair in this way. [Person2]:  Oh, it's really popular these days. [Person1]:  Do you think it's suitable for me? [Person2]:  Honestly speaking, I think the one next to it suits you better. [Person1]:  Even though I really like it, it's just too modern for me. [Person2]:  That's not true. Look over there! That lady chose the same one and she is surely older than you. [Person1]:  Okay then. And I also want to have my hair colored. [Person2]:  Which color do you like? [Person1]:  Claret-red. [Person2]:  Nice choice. [Person1]:  How long will it take? I hope it won't be too long. [Person2]:  I hope not but it will take at least three hours. [Person1]:  Now it's my son's turn to wait.
[Person1]:  Hi, I was wondering how I'd go about getting a credit card. [Person2]:  Certainly, Sir. You do have a Current Account with us right? [Person1]:  Oh, no, I'm afraid I don't. Is that necessary? [Person2]:  Yes, Sir. In order to get a credit card with us, you'll need to open a Current Account here. Could you please fill out this form with your relevant details? [Person1]:  That's done. Do you need to see any credentials? [Person2]:  Yes, a passport will be fine. [Person1]:  I don't have my passport on me at the moment. I'll just pop back to my office and pick it up. [Person2]:  That's fine, Sir. We'll see you again a little later.
[Person1]:  This is Mary. I just want to let you know that we made an offer to you. The salary is 3, 000 yuan a month, I e-mailed the offer to you as well.

[Person1]:  How can I help you? [Person2]:  I'm here for a facial. I made an appointment over the phone for 3 [Person1]:  What's your name? [Person2]:  Addison. [Person1]:  Ok. Which facial would you like? We have five different kinds of facials. [Person2]:  Which would you recommend? [Person1]:  Well, since it's summer and it looks like you've had quite a bit of sun, I'd recommend our summer special. It's especially suited for individuals with sensitive skin. [Person2]:  What does it include? [Person1]:  The facial will start with a thorough cleansing. [Person2]:  Does it include a facial mask and a massage? [Person1]:  Yes. The stimulation mask promotes blood flow and will firm up the skin. You can also choose to either get a hand or back massage as well. [Person2]:  Will you exfoliate the skin as well? [Person1]:  Yes. We'll also apply some of our special day cream that will moisturize our skin and protect it from the sun. [Person2]:  That sounds great. I'll have that one then. [Person1]:  Ok, just follow me.
[Person1]:  What did you say? [Person2]:  I said it's a lovely day. Why don't we go for a walk? [Person1]:  Well, I feel a little tired. [Person2]:  Come on! Rest breads rust. [Person1]:  Then can you wait a few minutes? I want to finish writing this letter. [Person2]:  I hope it won't be too long. It would be a shame not to take advantage of such lovely weather. [Person1]:  It won't be long. No more than ten minutes. Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you in the park? [Person2]:  OK! See you later!
[Person1]:  Is Stanley still singing that Elvis song? He's really hogging the mic! [Person2]:  If I hear Love Me Tender one more time, I think I'll go crazy! [Person1]:  He sounds like a sick cow! [Person2]:  Can we adjust the pitch a little? Maybe he'll sound better in a higher key. [Person1]:  I already tried that. Nothing seems to help. [Person2]:  Hey! Where are you going. . . ? [Person1]:  Coing out for a walk.
[Person1]:  What qualities do you think a business manager should possess? [Person2]:  Creativity, the ability to organize, the entrepreneur's spirit, comprehensive knowledge of human studies, ability of gathering information, expert competence of communication and deep professional skills. [Person1]:  If a client complains about the service of your department, what will you do? [Person2]:  If I'm in the service center. I'll listen to the client patiently, and accept the criticism objectively. Then I will have the claim reasonably settled.
[Person1]:  How can you be late again? You are always getting up late. [Person2]:  But this morning, I got up at six o'clock. [Person1]:  You are not telling the truth! It only takes one hour to go from your home to school. But look at your watch, it's 8 [Person2]:  But today the traffic jam took me one and a half hours to get through.
[Person1]:  Tongtong, have you finished your homework? We are going to meet your father at the station. [Person2]:  I'm busy doing it. My teacher has told us to hand it in tomorrow morning. Just a moment, I will finish it soon.
[Person1]:  IBA Bank, Business Banking Department. Ling Ming speaking. How may I help you? [Person2]:  Ms. Ling! It's Mr. Gwent, from Montgomery Computers. [Person1]:  Hello, Mr. Gwent. What can I do for you today? [Person2]:  Some money has been sent from our Head Office in Berlin. Could you check whether you have received the remittance yet? [Person1]:  Of course. Do you know which bank it was sent through and the amount and currency? [Person2]:  Deutsche Bank. It was 25, 000 US dollars. [Person1]:  Yes, here it is. That's received and cleared, so it's available for withdrawal.
[Person1]:  What seems to be the problem?  [Person2]:  Your secretary seems to think she is being harassed.  [Person1]:  What? You've got to be kidding me!  [Person2]:  I wish I were, but i am deadly serious. She said you invited her to dinner last week.  [Person1]:  Of course I did. As recongnition for a job well done. Once a month I invite the most productive employee to dinner.  [Person2]:  Well, there is no problem there. But she seemed to think that you were angry when she refused, and that your motives are personal and not professional.  [Person1]:  I think she's misinterpreted my intentions. What happens now?  [Person2]:  Our harassment policy requires that we have a meeting with the HR manager and Miss Brown. It's quite serious. You could be reprimanded, or even fired if we find evidence that you were pressurin  [Person1]:  I understand that. But I hope that we can get to the bottom fo this and show Miss Brown that she misunderstood my reaction.  [Person2]:  That's the purpose of the meeting. Sometimes a mediated conversation will straighten things out, and a little discussion and apology can calm the waters. 
[Person1]:  I've brought some potato chips. Would you like some, Jack?  [Person2]:  Yes. I'd like to swap some of my peanuts for your chips.  [Person1]:  That'll be fine. Thanks.  [Person2]:  Do you have any ketchup?  [Person1]:  I forgot to bring it, but maybe Mary has some. Let's go and ask her. 
[Person1]:  May I help you? [Person2]:  Yes, I would like to return these slacks. [Person1]:  Alright. Do you have your receipt? [Person2]:  Yes. Here it is. I bought them last week. [Person1]:  And why are you returning them? [Person2]:  I bought them to go with a blouse of mine. But they don't really match. [Person1]:  I see. Oh, wait. Ma'am, I'm sorry. These slacks were on sale. [Person2]:  Yes, they were thirty percent off. [Person1]:  I'm sorry, but we don't allow returns on sale items. [Person2]:  I know many stores have that policy. But I have returned sale items here before. [Person1]:  I'm sorry, but we usually don't do it. It is our policy. [Person2]:  I just bought these slacks a week ago. And I am a regular customer here. Can you make an exception this time? [Person1]:  Well. Let me talk to the manager for a moment. Ma'am, the manager says I can do it this time. [Person2]:  Good. I'm a regular customer here. I am glad you can make an exception for me. [Person1]:  Please show me your receipt again. [Person2]:  Here it is. [Person1]:  I will have to give you store credit, Ma'am. If you find something else you like in the store, you can use the credit. [Person2]:  Store credit is okay with me. I'm sure I will find something I like. I shop here a lot. [Person1]:  We appreciate your business, Ma'am.
[Person1]:  Oh, it's already 10 [Person2]:  Don't worry. The clock on the wall is 20 minutes fast. [Person1]:  Great. Please tell Alice to wait for me till 11 o'clock. [Person2]:  Where are you going? [Person1]:  We're going to Sally's birthday party. [Person2]:  When will it be? [Person1]:  It will be at about 12 o'clock in the rose restaurant.
[Person1]:  Was that telephone ringing? [Person2]:  I didn't hear anything. [Person1]:  I thought I heard it ring two or three times. [Person2]:  Sometimes when the windows are open, you can hear our neighbors phone. [Person1]:  Well, I'm expecting an important phone call and I don't want to miss it. [Person2]:  Is it anything I should know about? [Person1]:  Not really. It has something to do with work and doesn't really affect us here at home. [Person2]:  Well, why don't you go ahead and do what you want to do outside? I'll call you if the phone rings. [Person1]:  Thanks, I think I will. I've been waiting so long now. I'm getting nervous. I need to breathe in some fresh air.
[Person1]:  I take care of the letters. I may read, sort out and organize incoming mails. [Person2]:  So you have to open all the envelopes. [Person1]:  Yes, except the personal mail. And I also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e-mail box regularly. [Person2]:  Do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them? [Person1]:  Yes, and I check all the e-mails for Mr. Thomas. [Person2]:  I take care of the letters. I may read, sort out and organize incoming mails. [Person1]:  So you have to open all the envelopes. [Person2]:  Yes, except the personal mail. And I also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e-mail box regularly. [Person1]:  Do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them? [Person2]:  Yes, and I check all the e-mails for Mr. Thomas.
[Person1]:  Do you want a cigarette? [Person2]:  No, thank you. I've given up, you know. [Person1]:  You don't mind if I have one. [Person2]:  Well, all tight. But you know, smoking does do harm to your health. [Person1]:  Yes, you are right. [Person2]:  Why don't you try and give it up? [Person1]:  I've tried to give up smoking several times, but it's no use.
[Person1]:  Good afternoon, sir. May I help you? [Person2]:  Yes, I'd like a cheeseburger and a large order of French fries. [Person1]:  Would you like anything to drink with that? [Person2]:  Yes, a medium Coke. [Person1]:  Will that be all? [Person2]:  Yes. [Person1]:  For here or to go? [Person2]:  To go, please. ( The attendant hands the customer his order. ) [Person1]:  That'll be $ 4. 25. . . ( The customer gives her a 5 dollar bill. ). . . out of five. Here is your change, sir. Have a nice day.
[Person1]:  Okay, I want to change 22, 000. [Person2]:  Could you please fill out this form? [Person1]:  Okay, here you are. ( She hands the completed form and the money to the clerk. ) [Person2]:  Here's your $ 200. [Person1]:  Thank you very much. [Person2]:  Thank you.
[Person1]:  Excuse me, what material is it? [Person2]:  Rhaki. Do you want some? [Person1]:  No, where are the cotton cloths? [Person2]:  I will show you. [Person1]:  What is the shrink rate after washing? [Person2]:  Less than 5 %. It's quite durable.
[Person1]:  So, tell me, what makes you think we should give you a raise? [Person2]:  I've got several good reasons. I've been here several years, my work has proven to be good, and I've noticed that people in comparable jobs get paid more than I do. [Person1]:  Salaries are confidential, how do you know how much money these ' other people ' make? [Person2]:  Well, I've noticed all the new cars around here, for one thing. [Person1]:  Those are company cars provided to the sales staff for their business trips. Also, some employees receive sales commissions. So good salesmen will naturally earn more. [Person2]:  That's understandable. Well, rather than comparing my salary with someone else's, perhaps we could talk about my job performance. Surely you've noticed the extra hours I've put in recently? [Person1]:  I see your point. However, it might be hard to get a raise approved. Profits were down last quarter, and the whole company is tightening its belt, so anything that affects the annual budget [Person2]:  That would be very good of you, Mr. White.
[Person1]:  My, it looks too queer! [Person2]:  Yes, it is a queer drug, a tonic only available in China. Many ancient Chinese medicine journals have recorded that it can cure such ailments as night sweat, pain at loins and knees and anaemia. It has no side effect. [Person1]:  Great! Will you please tell me how to take it? [Person2]:  Yes, madam. Fill 3 or 5 pieces of Cordyceps into a cleaned and chopped open duck's head and cook with the whole duck. Or stew Cordyceps with chicken. [Person1]:  That sounds very interesting! [Person2]:  Please don't eat turnip and garlic when taking this medicine. [Person1]:  Thank you very much.
[Person1]:  Thanks for agreeing to this interview,Mrs. Rogers. My teacher wants me to interview someone who lived during the 1940s. [Person2]:  Of course, Joey. What's your first question? [Person1]:  Well,where were you living in 1940? [Person2]:  In Minneapolis, Minnesota, where I was born and raised. [Person1]:  Did you live with your family? [Person2]:  Yes,with my parents and my younger brother. In 1943,I moved to Washington D. C. by myself. I got a job as a typist for a newspaper. [Person1]:  What was D. C. like? [Person2]:  It was an exciting time to be living there. I got my interest in politics from being in the nation's capital. When I moved to California,I went straight to Sacramento and got a job working for a state lawmaker. [Person1]:  Were you in California when the war ended? [Person2]:  No, I was still in D. C. I met my husband there, and we moved the following year, in 1946. [Person1]:  How long did you work for the lawmaker? [Person2]:  Well, I was a secretary for that politician for two years. Then I had my two girls and stayed home for a few years. But as soon as they were old enough, I ran for office myself. [Person1]:  Really? Did you win? [Person2]:  I did. I spent the next 20 years as a local politician. [Person1]:  Wow. I've lived next door for years, and I didn't even know that!
[Person1]:  Oh, hi, Fred! I didn't know whether to save you a place or not. Why are you so late? [Person1]:  It's our maths teacher. She always keeps us in class until ten past ten. [Person2]:  Doesn't she know that you're supposed to get out at ten? [Person1]:  I guess so. But she never looks at her watch. She just keeps talking. [Person2]:  Don't the students complain about it? I would say something. [Person1]:  No. Everybody is too polite. [Person2]:  Well, you could try and talk to her. [Person1]:  Maybe. But I'm afraid she might feel hurt. [Person2]:  Well,it all depends on how and when you say it. If you tell her about it in a friendly way when she's not busy, she might be thankful. She might even ask you to remind her of the time in the future. [Person1]:  Really? That would be wonderful. Thanks for your advice.
[Person1]:  The air quality in this city is horrendous. The pollution levels are so high that we are not supposed to go outside with a face mask again!  [Person2]:  Exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment.  [Person1]:  On top of that, there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs, which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city.  [Person2]:  As much as I love this city,I think I'm going to find a greener city to live in. Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health.  [Person1]:  I know what you mean. However, there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming. If it's not the pollution, then it's the natural disasters, deforestation, or the greenhouse effect.  [Person2]:  What is the greenhouse effect exactly?  [Person1]:  It's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature.  [Person2]:  I see, so it's similar to global warming?  [Person1]:  They're related to one another, yes.  [Person2]:  I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live.  [Person1]:  People joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature,but it's not all good news. They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well.  [Person2]:  People always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations.  [Person1]:  I think if everyone pitches in, the world will be a better place. 
[Person1]:  Trina, will you marry me?  [Person2]:  Yes! Yes! And yes! Jared , of course I'll marry you!  [Person1]:  Oh,Babe, I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you! I can't wait for all the adventures we're going to have, for all the fights and the laughter. I can't wait to grow old and wrinkly with you.  [Person2]:  Oh, Jared! I can't wait for our wedding! I hope you don't mind, but I've already chosen a date! Six months from now in the summer! Melissa saw you buying the ring last month so I've had plenty of time to start planning!  [Person1]:  She what?  [Person2]:  Oh don't worry, sweetie, I didn't know when you were going to propose. It was still a nice surprise! As I was saying, I've got it all planned out. There's almost nothing left to do! I wrote up our guest list and we will have roughly four hundred guests attending.  [Person1]:  Four hundred?  [Person2]:  No need to sweat it. My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding, which is going to be low-budget anyway. So roughly four hundred people, which means that the hall at Northwood Heights will be our reception venue. I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents'church and my uncle of course would be officiating. We'll meet with him soon for some pre-wedding counseling. The music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer. My step-sister and her string quartet will take care of that. My cousin will be the official photographer. I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo. Did you know that she's going to be a professional opera singer?  [Person1]:  Ah. . .  [Person2]:  And then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet and we'll get the Youth Group to serve us. I was thinking that your friend's band could be our entertainment for the night. though they might have to tone it down a bit. Or we could hire a DJ. Your sister's husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings. what's their name again? I was thinking that we could have an island paradise-themed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like Aquamarine. And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we'll make our toasts! What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors? Who else am I missing? Oh, your uncle could be our florist and his wife could make our wedding cake!  [Person1]:  Wow.  [Person2]:  See? It's going to be wonderful! Oh this wedding is going to be everything I ever dreamed of.  [Person1]:  If I survive the next six months. 
[Person1]:  Can you feel that the plane's taking off now? [Person2]:  No, nothing at all. It's smooth and quiet. [Person1]:  How do you like traveling by air? [Person2]:  Oh, it's speedy and very comfortable. I must say, I prefer it to traveling by train. [Person1]:  Do you ever suffer from airsickness? [Person2]:  No. I've never had such a feeling. [Person1]:  Do you think air travel is just as safe as traveling by rail? [Person2]:  Probably not. [Person1]:  What kind of sensation do you have when the plane drops into an air pocket? [Person2]:  It's the same kind of sinking feeling you get when you go down fast on a lift.
[Person1]:  We are thinking about putting on a show this spring. [Person2]:  And do you think you'll be able to make some money? [Person1]:  Oh no, we just want to do it for the fun of it, you know, there are a lot of us who like to perform on a stage. [Person2]:  What kind of show? [Person1]:  A musical play. [Person2]:  Have you decided who is going to do it? [Person1]:  We have 3 people in mind, and of course we've been thinking about you. [Person2]:  Me? Why me? [Person1]:  You sing, don't you? Everyone says you have a wonderful voice. [Person2]:  Well, I have sung a little. But I've never really appeared on a stage. [Person1]:  I thought you sang in church every Sunday. [Person2]:  That's different, there are so many others singing too. [Person1]:  Then here's your chance to find out how good you are, and not just to sing, but to act and dance, too. [Person2]:  Oh, it might be exciting.
[Person1]:  Um, hello again. Are you sure you don't want to make a purchase, sir? [Person2]:  I have a question. [Person1]:  Hush... OK. What is it? [Person2]:  Why do people like all this fancy, expensive underwear? [Person1]:  What kind of question is that? [Person2]:  I'm just curious. I think women are beautiful without this stuff. [Person1]:  Uh... yeah, right...
[Person1]:  Can you give me more details on what is included in the package? [Person2]:  Sure. The coach leaves at 6 [Person1]:  What about the hotel accommodations? [Person2]:  You'll be staying at Holiday Inn. It's a three-star hotel with two restaurants and a swimming pool. [Person1]:  Great. What types of things will we do at Lushun Falls? [Person2]:  The second day you take a four-hour city tour. In the afternoon you go on the famous boat cruise under the falls.
[Person1]:  morning, Mr. Montgomery. I'Ve been sent over from purchasing to fill in for Clare Williams. [Person2]:  Oh, really? Nice to meet you. I thought they were going to leave me here on my own! How long have you been with the company? [Person1]:  Oh, about seven years. Time flies, you know! [Person2]:  Does it ever! Well, let's get started. If you could begin typing this letter now, I'll see what else needs to be done.
[Person1]:  You must like negotiating a lot. People are saying, you are a super negotiator. [Person2]:  Ha, I am flattered. Actually, when it comes to negotiate, you don't need to like it. You just need to understand how it works. [Person1]:  I am not good at it by any means. Give me some advice. [Person2]:  Well, generally speaking, if you want to change someone's mind or understand his position, you have to put yourself in his shoes. Understand his need and the cost for his need. And then you work together to find a solution. [Person1]:  Sounds easy. But how can I apply to practice? I am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill. But I am afraid our boss will turn me down. [Person2]:  Ok, as John after Kennedy put it, let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate.
[Person1]:  Have you run into your cousin Jimmy lately? [Person2]:  As a matter of fact, I have. I ran into him just the other day. [Person1]:  How's he doing? [Person2]:  Not too well. He had to have four teeth pulled last week. [Person1]:  He did? That's too bad! [Person2]:  I think so, too. [Person1]:  Next time you see him, please tell him I'm thinking of him. [Person2]:  I'll be sure to do that.
[Person1]:  Congratulations! I heard that you are going to take a two-week training course in the headquarter. [Person2]:  Thank you. I am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new. You know information and knowledge in this field update very fast. [Person1]:  Sure it is. This is a changing world. Does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month? They are very useful for us. [Person2]:  Yes, according to the agenda, there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course. [Person1]:  Well, good for you. I hope you can get what you want from the training. [Person2]:  I will do my best.
[Person1]:  What's this then? [Person2]:  It's my geography, sir. The Map of Africa you set us. [Person1]:  But this should have been handed in last Thursday. [Person2]:  Yes, I know, sir. I'm sorry. [Person1]:  Well, what's your excuse then? [Person2]:  My mother's been ill and I had to stay at home. [Person1]:  Oh, Yes? [Person2]:  It's true, sir.
[Person1]:  The Blacks got divorced. [Person2]:  Really? Why? [Person1]:  Mr. Black has been getting a little on the side. [Person2]:  Really? I am surprised. He doesn't look like a guy who'd ever cheat on his wife, does he? [Person1]:  No, he doesn't. Anyway, his wife found out that he has been two-timing for a long time. [Person2]:  Well, I am really surprised. By the way, have you done anything behind my back? [Person1]:  No. The only thing I've ever done behind your back is zipping you up. [Person2]:  I like that joke, but I hope it's true.
[Person1]:  Good morning, sir. What can I do for you? [Person2]:  I'm Jack in Room 606. Can you change the room for me? It's too noisy. My friend was woken up several times by the noise from upstairs. He said it was too much for him. [Person1]:  I'm awfully sorry, sir. I do apologize. A ten-year-old boy and a mother live upstairs. Maybe the boy is a little bit naughty. [Person2]:  Anyway, I'd like to change our room. [Person1]:  No problem, sir. We'll manage it.
[Person1]:  A friend told me might find a room here. [Person2]:  Yes. I'll have a room free next week. [Person1]:  What do you charge? [Person2]:  12, 000 yuan a year, but you can't have visitors live in it. [Person1]:  OK. Would it be all right to look at the room first? [Person2]:  Could you come back later? We're right in the middle of dinner.
[Person1]:  Hmm. Not bad. I think I look younger with shorter hair. [Person2]:  Yes, you do. The Hot Cap is back here in the corner. I think we're ready to put the curlers in. What kind of perm would you like? [Person1]:  I just want a light wave. I look really silly if my hair is too curly. [Person2]:  All right. What if we leave your bangs straight and just perm the sides and back? [Person1]:  Super. How long will I have to sit under the Hot Cap? [Person2]:  Around 30 minutes.
[Person1]:  Home at last. Tonight we have a lot of homework though. [Person2]:  Are you saying we don't have time to watch our favorite show tonight? Jane, you know I really don't like our teacher all that much. He gives far too much homework. He criticizes me in front of everyone all the time. [Person1]:  To tell the truth, I don't really like him either. He's kind of boring and not very active. He always looks unhappy too. [Person2]:  Yes, and he also. . . [Person1]:  Do you think we should be talking about him like this behind his back? [Person2]:  Probably not. After all he is our teacher. We should try to find something nice to say. If you can't say something nice you shouldn't say anything at all. [Person1]:  I absolutely agree. It's getting dark. We should finish our homework now. [Person2]:  All right. I want to take a shower first, I'm exhausted.
[Person1]:  Hey, Ashley. How many people are coming to the barbecue tomorrow? [Person2]:  Well, um, there's your family; that's four people. [ Okay. ] There are three from my work [ Okay. ], and then Mike and Megan from across the street. And you and me, of course. [Person1]:  Okay. So, what is everyone bringing? [Person2]:  Um, let's see. Here's my list. Um ... Your brothers are bringing hamburgers, cheese, and buns. [Person1]:  Oh! I'm glad they are in charge of that. [ Yeah, me too. ] You know, my brother, Jim ... He eats like a horse. [ Uh-huh. ] At the last barbecue, he put away at least, what, five hotdogs and five cheeseburgers ... [Person2]:  No, I think it was six. Six cheeseburgers. It might have been more hotdogs. I don't know. [Person1]:  He was still hungry! [Person2]:  I know. I don't know how he did it. He does that all the time, he's ... and he's not even fat. You'd think (he would be fat). Anyway. Oh, yeah, anyway. So, my friends from work said that they could buy chips and salsa [ Okay. ], and they're going to bring a salad [ Alright. ]. And one of them is vegetarian, and so she's going to bring her own veggie burger, so you don't have to worry about her. [Person1]:  Okay. That's ... That'll work out. [Person2]:  And Mike and Megan. You're going to love this. They're going to bring some of the corn from their garden. [Person1]:  Oh, their corn is always so, so good. [Person2]:  Yeah, I know. It's wonderful. [Person1]:  So, um, yeah. What about drink? [Person2]:  Well, we're going to have soda and juice, and ice water as well. [Person1]:  Okay. And what about dessert? [Person2]:  I already have some ice cream and some homemade apple pie in the fridge. [Person1]:  Oh. I can't wait. [Person2]:  This is going to be fun. Yeah.
[Person1]:  Bob, why are you looking so depressed? [Person2]:  Mum, I'm not a good boy. I broke father's glass just now. [Person1]:  Oh, son. Would it be a good idea to tell him the truth? [Person2]:  Yeah, but I'm afraid he'll scold me.
[Person1]:  Do you mind if I smoke here?  [Person2]:  Yes, I do. I'd prefer you didn't. The AC (air-conditioning) is also on.  [Person1]:  Can I just turn off the AC for now and open the window and smoke indoors?  [Person2]:  That's not a very good idea. It's quite hot outside. Why don't you smoke outside?  [Person1]:  It's very hot and that's why I'd like to smoke inside.  [Person2]:  Though the AC has the air-purifying function. I'd still rather have fresh air than smoke. Are you okay with that?  [Person1]:  Oh, no problem. 
[Person1]:  You're going to have coffee, aren't you?  [Person2]:  Yes. I could use a cup of coffee.  [Person1]:  Are you going to have anything to eat?  [Person2]:  French toast sounds good. What are you going to order?  [Person1]:  I'll have that too. 
[Person1]:  Good morning, Linda. How have you been?  [Person2]:  Pretty bad. I've had a bad cold for three days and still can't get rid of it.  [Person1]:  I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything else I can do?  [Person2]:  No, thanks.  [Person1]:  Well, I hope you'll feel better soon.  [Person2]:  Thank you for your concern. 
[Person1]:  Well, known, Jim, I'm. . . I'm pretty much in favour of your computers, I think computers teach kids to think, because they require logical thoughts.  [Person2]:  But I. . . I don't agree with thatbecause computers weaken kids'ability to thinkbecause kids don't learn basic skills.  [Person1]:  What do you mean?  [Person2]:  They can't spell, they can't add, they can't subtract, they even don't remember any more. that's because they rely on gadgets.  [Person1]:  That's not the gadgets. Creating programmes is stimulate thoughts. It engages their imagination and sharpen their mind. 
[Person1]:  What's the plot of your new movie?  [Person2]:  It's a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders. I play the part of the detective. He has to catch the killer, but there's very little evidence. It's a psychological thriller with some frightening scenes, but I hope audience won't be too scared to go to the movie theatres!  [Person1]:  Did you enjoy making the movie? We heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director.  [Person2]:  I have had disagreement with every director. I've worked with. We've always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences. It was the same when I made this movie. I don't know where rumours of my disagreement with Rachel Kelly come from. We got on very well and I hope to work with her again. I enjoyed making the movie very much.  [Person1]:  Critics are not very happy with the movies that you've made recently. Does that bother you?  [Person2]:  Not at all. The feedback from audience has been great. I care about what they think more than what the critics think.  [Person1]:  Did you do you own stunts in the movie?  [Person2]:  I wanted to , but my insurance company wouldn't let me. All of my stunts were done by a stuntman. As you know, I used to do my own stunts, but I'll leave that to the experts in future.  [Person1]:  Thank you very much for doing this interview.  [Person2]:  My pleasure. Have you seen the movie yet?  [Person1]:  Yes. I have. I liked it very much. Like you, I was very impressed with rachel's performance in the movie. She's going to be a star. 
[Person1]:  The carrots taste awful in salty. How do you like them? [Person2]:  I like them very much. They are delicious. [Person1]:  Well, you can have all my carrots. I saw you buy some chocolate cakes. I am done with the main course. It's about time for some dessert. [Person2]:  Oh, you want my chocolate cakes? [Person1]:  No, no. I'm just thinking of some dessert and I have had enough carrots. [Person2]:  Robert, carrots contain much vitamin C. It is good for you. [Person1]:  I know, but chocolate cake is even better. [Person2]:  Oh, stop it. You know you need vegetables. You will end up fat if you don't watch your diet now. [Person1]:  Well, actually I don't mind eating carrots, but chocolate cakes are much better. You know, I was born with a sweet tooth.
[Person1]:  Universal Travel Agency, may I help you? [Person2]:  Yes, my husband and I want to take a vacation to an island somewhere. Do you have any places to recommend? [Person1]:  Certainly, off the top of my head. I would suggest the island of Bali. [Person2]:  Why Bali? [Person1]:  At this time of year. Most places have a lot of rain, but it is the dry season in Bali. There are also many excellent restaurants and hotels to choose from, plus, Bali is known for its surfing and diving, and I must say that the shopping is absolutely great. [Person2]:  That sounds amazing. Jason loves to dive, and I love to shop and eat. Can you tell me how much it will cost for the two of us? [Person1]:  It will take a day or two to get up-to-date prices, but I will call you as soon as I do. [Person2]:  Thank you, would we have to pay for the trip right away? [Person1]:  I'll need your credit card number to make a reservation. But you won't actually have to pay for it until you get there. [Person2]:  That sounds great. I'll have a discussion with Jason and let you know our decision soon.
[Person1]:  Nancy, how are you feeling this morning? You're not looking very good. [Person2]:  No. I'm not in the best of health. [Person1]:  It's the same old story, isn't it? Overwork! Listen, Nancy. You can't go on burning the candle at both ends! [Person2]:  You're right, but I want to use every minute of my time studying my subjects. Besides, I'm under a lot of pressure in class. Sometimes I can't follow the professor and very often I'm not able to take notes while listening. I have to check notes with my friend, which is very time-consuming. [Person1]:  I can understand Nancy. But if you go and working so hard, you could become ill and that would waste lots of time. Do you sleep enough? [Person2]:  Well, about 5 hours a day. [Person1]:  That's horrible. Are you sure you completely recovered from that bad cold you had last week? [Person2]:  I'm afraid not. I so easily catch cold nowadays. [Person1]:  Take my advice and rest for a day. Get out to enjoy the fresh air and sunshine, and you'll feel brand new. [Person2]:  I've got an essay to finish. [Person1]:  Don't think about it. Go out. It would do you a world of good and you will never regret it. [Person2]:  All right. I'll do that, Jack. Thank you.
[Person1]:  I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there's something wrong with the fax machine. [Person2]:  What's wrong with the fax machine? Is it urgent? [Person1]:  Yes, very urgent. And there is no other fax machine around. And the office of our boss is closed, so I can not use his machine either. And his secretary is out. Do you have any suggestion? [Person2]:  Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail, you print it out.
[Person1]:  I had prepared dinner for eight people before Mary called and said that she and her husband could not make it. [Person2]:  That's all right. I am just going to tell you I have invited Tom and his girlfriend.
[Person1]:  I hear you are planning to travel abroad. [Person2]:  Yes. I'm going to the Untied States for travel. What places do you recommend? [Person1]:  In my opinion, there are several places you mustn't miss, like Washington D. C, Las Vegas, New York and Los Angeles. [Person2]:  Someone suggests that I should go to Seattle and Hawaii. [Person1]:  Yes, you may consider those two places also. Seattle, for example, is worth visiting and there's a very famous museum called Museum of Flight. [Person2]:  And Seattle is the home of Microsoft and Boeing. That must be a great place. I can't miss it.
[Person1]:  What can I do for you? [Person2]:  I would like to file a complaint. [Person1]:  What happened? [Person2]:  I was robbed. [Person1]:  When did this happen? [Person2]:  It happened this morning. [Person1]:  What was taken from you? [Person2]:  My wallet and my cell phone. [Person1]:  Were you able to get a look at this person's face? [Person2]:  Yes, I was. [Person1]:  Would you be able to pick him out of a line-up? [Person2]:  That would be easy.
[Person1]:  That price of ours, by the way, is for a minimum quantity of 1, 000 saddles. [Person2]:  Yes, I noticed that. To what extent would local assembly help sales, did you say? [Person1]:  20-30 %. But we proposed the plan from the storage and delivery viewpoint. That is to say, less warehouse space and prompt delivery. [Person2]:  Yes, of course. Assembly would be quite a simple matter. Cycle dealers could put them together in a very short time. [Person1]:  Sales have been exceptionally good during the past twelve months. [Person2]:  Yes, I've noticed that. Where have you been placing them? [Person1]:  All in the local market. One or two suggestions that came in from the distribution might interest you. [Person2]:  Yes. What were they? Anything that will help sales? [Person1]:  Perhaps. General opinion is that the rear carrier should be offered as an extra. [Person2]:  That's to keep the price down, I suppose. I'll take it up with our overseas department and listen to what they've got to say about this. [Person1]:  Thanks.
[Person1]:  Have you heard about Alice and David? [Person2]:  No, have they had another fight? [Person1]:  No, they've got engaged. [Person2]:  You must be joking. Those two? [Person1]:  Well, my dear, I didn't believe it either. But I got it straight from the horse's mouth. David called me this morning. [Person2]:  So when did this all happen? [Person1]:  Last weekend, while they were on their ski trip. [Person2]:  Well, I believe it now, and when are they are getting married? [Person1]:  Next June. [Person2]:  I can hardly believe it.
[Person1]:  I have to miss school next week. [Person2]:  Isn't there some way you could work your schedule out to be here? [Person1]:  Unfortunately, this is what I have to do. [Person2]:  How are you going to catch up? [Person1]:  I've got it all covered. [Person2]:  If you miss this class, you will have used up your quota for the semester. [Person1]:  Don't worry, this will be the last class I miss. [Person2]:  Make sure to remind me right before you are absent. [Person1]:  I'll remember. [Person2]:  Enjoy your day off and don't forget to study!
[Person1]:  We have to pick up Conrad before the party. [Person2]:  Alright, no problem. [Person1]:  We're supposed to meet him at Cal's Bar at 10 [Person2]:  Wait a minute. Cal's bar? [Person1]:  Yes. [Person2]:  That's a gay bar. [Person1]:  Yes, it is. Conrad is gay. Didn't you know? [Person2]:  I thought he was maybe gay, but I wasn't sure. Anyhow, you don't expect me to go into a gay bar, do you? [Person1]:  Why not? We're supposed to meet him there. [Person2]:  Why doesn't he meet us outside? [Person1]:  Why should he do that? It isn't illegal for us to go in. [Person2]:  Yeah, but who wants to go in? I'm not gay, you know. Why should I go in a gay bar? [Person1]:  You sound like you're afraid. [Person2]:  I just wouldn't be comfortable. [Person1]:  You've never been in a gay bar before? [Person2]:  No, never. [Person1]:  But it's just a bar. There's no danger. You shouldn't be so homophobic. [Person2]:  Well. . . [Person1]:  Listen. If you refuse to go in, Conrad will be offended. You don't hate gay people, do you? [Person2]:  No, I don't. But I never went into a gay bar before. [Person1]:  Don't worry about it. There is nothing strange about it. If Conrad's there, we'll leave for the party. If he's not, we'll sit down and have a drink. [Person2]:  Okay. I will try it. I suppose it isn't reasonable for me to refuse to go in. After all, gay people aren't afraid to go into normal bars. [Person1]:  I'm glad you feel that way. We'll leave in about ten minutes, alright? [Person2]:  Fine.
[Person1]:  You hoo, anybody here? [Person2]:  Over here, Betty! [Person1]:  Hi, Rock Sam! Hey, I am surprised to see you doing so well. [Person2]:  Haha. Don't worry, Betty. So tell me, what's the latest gossip? Unless you want to keep it to yourself. [Person1]:  No way. Alisan Darling just got hitched in Vagas. [Person2]:  No kidding! What happened to Ad? [Person1]:  Darling found out he was having a fling, and one new girl found out about Darling she dumped him too. [Person2]:  Was, talk about a double whammy. [Person1]:  Ya. And now I can break this to you. Fanny is moving. [Person2]:  Oh, right. What a load off my mind. I really don't like her. [Person1]:  Well I have to go, Rock Sam. You take it easy, OK. [Person2]:  Thanks for the visit, Betty.
[Person1]:  So what brings you to my office today? [Person2]:  My tooth is killing me! [Person1]:  How long has your tooth been bothering you? [Person2]:  It just started hurting me last night. [Person1]:  Have you injured your tooth in any way? [Person2]:  I think one of my fillings might be coming loose. [Person1]:  Do you have a special kind of toothbrush that you like to use? [Person2]:  I have an electric toothbrush. [Person1]:  Does it bother you when you eat something really sweet? [Person2]:  Oh yeah, when I do that, it hurts a lot more!
[Person1]:  Hello, sir. Have you anything to declare? [Person2]:  This is my first tourism. I don't know what should be declared. [Person1]:  OK. Please open your luggage, and I'll tell you what you should declare. [Person2]:  All right. Here you are. [Person1]:  You should declare the camera and the film. Do you have alcohol? [Person2]:  Yes, I have got some special local product, I want to take them for my friends. [Person1]:  How many bottles have you got with you? [Person2]:  Four bottles. [Person1]:  I'm sorry. According to the regulations, a passenger can only take two bottles on to the aircraft. So you cannot take so many. [Person2]:  What shall I do with my two more bottles? [Person1]:  You may give them to your friends who come to see you off. This is the Customs Declaration Form. Please fill in it. And then you can go through the other formalities. Be sure to keep the form safe. [Person2]:  All right, thank you, see you. [Person1]:  See you. Have a good journey.
[Person1]:  Hi, my name is Tom. [Person2]:  Tom, the new sales representative? Nice to meet you! I'm Melinda. [Person1]:  Nice to meet you too. Melinda. [Person2]:  Now let me show you around. This is our reception area, and our conference room is right over there. Over there is the sales department. [Person1]:  Really? This is a nice office, but it's quite small. [Person2]:  Yeah. . . You can make photocopies and send faxes over there. [Person1]:  It looks like you guys work hard. [Person2]:  I tell you what just between you and me, we just mess things up so that it looks like we work hard. Just kidding. Oh, your cubicle is over the. And this way. Those are all private offices--the managers'offices. [Person1]:  Hmm. . . Tell me more details about our jobs. [Person2]:  Sure thing.
[Person1]:  Good morning, Mr. Smith. I hope I'm not disturbing your work. [Person2]:  Not at all, Mary. Come in and take a seat. I'm always in my office before lunch. [Person1]:  I want to tell you that I have already started writing my paper and I'd like to discuss my topic with you. [Person2]:  Of course. What would you like to work on?
[Person1]:  So how were your schooldays when you were a child, Joan? [Person2]:  Well, from seven to twelve I went to a school in Belgium. [Person1]:  In Belgium? How come? [Person2]:  It was my father's idea. One of his friends was sending his daughter, and my father wanted to impress his friend so he decided to send me, too. [Person1]:  Just to impress a friend? It's hard to believe. So what was it like? [Person2]:  We had to get up early and go to church before class. And at mealtimes we just had to sit silently with our hands folded in our laps. And I wasn't allowed to speak English at all. I had to learn French but nobody taught me. I just had to sit in the lessons and try to understand. [Person1]:  It's awful for a child of seven! [Person2]:  And they were terribly strict about manners! I suppose that was one good thing. I had the most beautiful manners when I left.
[Person1]:  Exccuse me, waiter, I would like to have some wine before the main course.  [Person2]:  Have you decided what wine you would like?  [Person1]:  I have no idea. Maybe you can give me some advice.  [Person2]:  I recommend you the white wine. It will wake up your appetite.  [Person1]:  That's great, bring me a bottle of that please. 
[Person1]:  So what's your guys'take on all this global warming hysteria in the media?  [Person2]:  It's pretty serious, man. There have been tons of scientific studies and the scientific community says that the earth is heating up. We need to make some drastic changes to our lifestyle if we want to preserve our planet.  [Person1]:  I don't know. It sounds like a bunch of mumbo jumbo if you ask me. 'Save the earth! ' The earth will save itself. It's survived worst disasters in the past. I mean, honestly, we live in the boonies. There's no way anyone here is ever going to walk or bike to work, especially in the winter. And we have no bus system. My house is forty years old and it would take a lot of money to get it refitted to be 'green' and 'energy-efficient'.  [Person3]:  Well, I don't really know if I believe in global warming either, or whether or not it was our doing or a natural change the earth is going through, but you have to admit that we're living pretty irresponsibly here in the west.  [Person1]:  I guess. . .  [Person3]:  I think the issue at hand is sustainability. We've only got this one earth we can live on, and our resources are quickly disappearing because of our own carelessness and our inability to think of anyone but ourselves and anything but the present.  [Person2]:  So, like I was saying, we need to change the way we live. We need to reduce our carbon footprint.  [Person3]:  But it doesn't have to be that drastic. Hybrid vehicles and solar panels are too expensive to be feasible right now. And we don't have to be hippies living off the land and buying everything organic either, though it helps.  [Person2]:  I car pool to work everyday with some buddies of mine. I have a rain barrel outside my house I use to water my plants and my lawn in the summer, and I make sure I always bring reusable bags with me when I get my groceries. And we just started using bio-degradable plastic made from corn oil for take-out orders at my family's restaurant. Remember the three R's? Reduce. Reuse. Recycle.  [Person3]:  Exactly, it's just small simple changes, like buying energy-saving light bulbs, starting a compost bin, recycling bottles and papers, using reusable water bottles, stop using disposable cups and cutlery.  [Person1]:  Like the ones we're drinking out of?  [Person2]:  Yeah.
