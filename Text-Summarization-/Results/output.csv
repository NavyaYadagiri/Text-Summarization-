But I'll have a rough idea and we'll budget for the number I give you then. We've sent out 100 invitations...[Person2]: 100?![Person1]: Yes, well, in theory that meant that there could be 200 people.[Person2]: Yes, but the room won't...[Person1]: But of course, haha...

"[Person1]: What are the main differences between this country and your country?[Person2]: Well, in Russia, everything happens very fast.
